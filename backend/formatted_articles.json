    "summary": "Games, in their mathematical sense, are everywhere (game industries, economics, defense, education, chemistry, biology, ...).Search algorithms in games are artificial intelligence methods for playing such games. Unfortunately, there is no study on these algorithms that evaluates the generality of their performance. We propose to address this gap in the case of two-player zero-sum games with perfect information. Furthermore, we propose a new search algorithm and we show that, for a short search time, it outperforms all studied algorithms on all games in this large experiment and that, for a medium search time, it outperforms all studied algorithms on 17 of the 22 studied games.",

    "summary": "Given a classification model and a prediction for some input, there are heuristic strategies for ranking features according to their importance in regard to the prediction. One common approach to this task is rooted in propositional logic and the notion of \\textit{sufficient reason}. Through this concept, the categories of relevant and necessary features were proposed in order to identify the crucial aspects of the input. This paper improves the existing techniques and algorithms for deciding which are the relevant and/or necessary features, showing in particular that necessity can be detected efficiently in complex models such as neural networks. We also generalize the notion of relevancy and study associated problems. Moreover, we present a new global notion (i.e. that intends to explain whether a feature is important for the behavior of the model in general, not depending on a particular input) of \\textit{usefulness} and prove that it is related to relevancy and necessity. Furthermore, we develop efficient algorithms for detecting it in decision trees and other more complex models, and experiment on three datasets to analyze its practical utility.",

    "summary": "Understanding an agent's intent through its behavior is essential in human-robot interaction, interactive AI systems, and multi-agent collaborations. This task, known as Goal Recognition (GR), poses significant challenges in dynamic environments where goals are numerous and constantly evolving. Traditional GR methods, designed for a predefined set of goals, often struggle to adapt to these dynamic scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce the General Dynamic GR problem - a broader definition of GR - aimed at enabling real-time GR systems and fostering further research in this area. Expanding on this foundation, this paper employs a model-free goal-conditioned RL approach to enable fast adaptation for GR across various changing tasks.",

    "summary": "Deep learning models have shown promise in lung pathology detection from chest X-rays, but widespread clinical adoption remains limited due to opaque model decision-making. In prior work, we introduced ClinicXAI, a human-centric, expert-guided concept bottleneck model (CBM) designed for interpretable lung cancer diagnosis. We now extend that approach and present XpertXAI, a generalizable expert-driven model that preserves human-interpretable clinical concepts while scaling to detect multiple lung pathologies. Using a high-performing InceptionV3-based classifier and a public dataset of chest X-rays with radiology reports, we compare XpertXAI against leading post-hoc explainability methods and an unsupervised CBM, XCBs. We assess explanations through comparison with expert radiologist annotations and medical ground truth. Although XpertXAI is trained for multiple pathologies, our expert validation focuses on lung cancer. We find that existing techniques frequently fail to produce clinically meaningful explanations, omitting key diagnostic features and disagreeing with radiologist judgments. XpertXAI not only outperforms these baselines in predictive accuracy but also delivers concept-level explanations that better align with expert reasoning. While our focus remains on explainability in lung cancer detection, this work illustrates how human-centric model design can be effectively extended to broader diagnostic contexts - offering a scalable path toward clinically meaningful explainable AI in medical diagnostics.",

While recent approaches leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have achieved strong results, they continue to face challenges such as factual inconsistency, hallucination, and cross-modal misalignment. We propose a multimodal multi-agent framework for RRG that aligns with the stepwise clinical reasoning workflow, where task-specific agents handle retrieval, draft generation, visual analysis, refinement, and synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms a strong baseline in both automatic metrics and LLM-based evaluations, producing more accurate, structured, and interpretable reports. This work highlights the potential of clinically aligned multi-agent frameworks to support explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications.",

In response, this study defines good questions and presents a systematic evaluation framework. We propose two key evaluation dimensions: appropriateness (sociolinguistic competence in context) and effectiveness (strategic competence in goal achievement). Based on these foundational dimensions, a rubric-based scoring system was developed. By incorporating dynamic contextual variables, our evaluation framework achieves structure and flexibility through semi-adaptive criteria. The methodology was validated using the CAUS and SQUARE datasets, demonstrating the ability of the framework to access both well-formed and problematic questions while adapting to varied contexts. As we establish a flexible and comprehensive framework for question evaluation, this study takes a significant step toward integrating questioning behavior with structured analytical methods grounded in the intrinsic nature of questioning.",

This whitepaper chronicles this remarkable journey, charting the key technological milestones--advancements in prompting, training methodologies, hardware capabilities, and architectural innovations--that have converged to create the AI agents of today. We argue that these agents, exemplified by systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT with plugins and xAI's Grok, represent a culminating phase in AI development, potentially constituting the \"final generation\" of intelligence as we currently conceive it. We explore the capabilities and underlying technologies of these agents, grounded in practical examples, while also examining the profound societal implications and the unprecedented pace of progress that suggests intelligence is now doubling approximately every six months. The paper concludes by underscoring the critical need for wisdom and foresight in navigating the opportunities and challenges presented by this powerful new era of intelligence.",

    "summary": "The ReAct (Reasoning + Action) capability in large language models (LLMs) has become the foundation of modern agentic systems. Recent LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1/o3, exemplify this by emphasizing reasoning through the generation of ample intermediate tokens, which help build a strong premise before producing the final output tokens. In this paper, we introduce Pre-Act, a novel approach that enhances the agent's performance by creating a multi-step execution plan along with the detailed reasoning for the given user input. This plan incrementally incorporates previous steps and tool outputs, refining itself after each step execution until the final response is obtained. Our approach is applicable to both conversational and non-conversational agents. To measure the performance of task-oriented agents comprehensively, we propose a two-level evaluation framework: (1) turn level and (2) end-to-end. Our turn-level evaluation, averaged across five models, shows that our approach, Pre-Act, outperforms ReAct by 70% in Action Recall on the Almita dataset. While this approach is effective for larger models, smaller models crucial for practical applications, where latency and cost are key constraints, often struggle with complex reasoning tasks required for agentic systems. To address this limitation, we fine-tune relatively small models such as Llama 3.1 (8B & 70B) using the proposed Pre-Act approach. Our experiments show that the fine-tuned 70B model outperforms GPT-4, achieving a 69.5% improvement in action accuracy (turn-level) and a 28% improvement in goal completion rate (end-to-end) on the Almita (out-of-domain) dataset.",

    "summary": "Depression is a widespread mental health issue affecting diverse age groups, with notable prevalence among college students and the elderly. However, existing datasets and detection methods primarily focus on young adults, neglecting the broader age spectrum and individual differences that influence depression manifestation. Current approaches often establish a direct mapping between multimodal data and depression indicators, failing to capture the complexity and diversity of depression across individuals. This challenge includes two tracks based on age-specific subsets: Track 1 uses the MPDD-Elderly dataset for detecting depression in older adults, and Track 2 uses the MPDD-Young dataset for detecting depression in younger participants. The Multimodal Personality-aware Depression Detection (MPDD) Challenge aims to address this gap by incorporating multimodal data alongside individual difference factors. We provide a baseline model that fuses audio and video modalities with individual difference information to detect depression manifestations in diverse populations. This challenge aims to promote the development of more personalized and accurate de pression detection methods, advancing mental health research and fostering inclusive detection systems.

    "summary": "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) lack direct interaction between learners and instructors, making it challenging for learners to understand new knowledge concepts. Recently, learners have increasingly used Large Language Models (LLMs) to support them in acquiring new knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to hallucinations which limits their reliability. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving relevant documents before generating a response. However, the application of RAG across different MOOCs is limited by unstructured learning material. Furthermore, current RAG systems do not actively guide learners toward their learning needs. To address these challenges, we propose a Graph RAG pipeline that leverages Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) and Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) to guide learners to understand knowledge concepts in the MOOC platform CourseMapper. Specifically, we implement (1) a PKG-based Question Generation method to recommend personalized questions for learners in context, and (2) an EduKG-based Question Answering method that leverages the relationships between knowledge concepts in the EduKG to answer learner selected questions. To evaluate both methods, we conducted a study with 3 expert instructors on 3 different MOOCs in the MOOC platform CourseMapper. The results of the evaluation show the potential of Graph RAG to empower learners to understand new knowledge concepts in a personalized learning experience.",

This study responds to the growing need to systematically revisit and reorganize decades of Taiwan based CS scholarship by proposing an AI assisted approach that transforms unstructured academic texts into structured, interactive knowledge representations. We apply generative AI (GAI) techniques and large language models (LLMs) to extract and standardize entity relation triples from 1,367 peer reviewed CS articles published between 1996 and 2019. These triples are then visualized through a lightweight this http URL based system, forming the foundation of a domain specific knowledge graph and vector database for the field. This infrastructure allows users to explore conceptual nodes and semantic relationships across the corpus, revealing previously uncharted intellectual trajectories, thematic clusters, and research gaps. By decomposing textual content into graph structured knowledge units, our system enables a paradigm shift from linear text consumption to network based knowledge navigation. In doing so, it enhances scholarly access to CS literature while offering a scalable, data driven alternative to traditional ontology construction. This work not only demonstrates how generative AI can augment area studies and digital humanities but also highlights its potential to support a reimagined scholarly infrastructure for regional knowledge systems.",

In this paper, we explore different approaches to generating explanations in eXplainable AI (XAI) and make their underlying arguments explicit so that they can be evaluated by medical experts. In particular, we present the findings of a user study conducted with physicians to investigate their perceptions of various types of AI-generated explanations in the context of diagnostic decision support. The study aims to identify the most effective and useful explanations that enhance the diagnostic process. In the study, medical doctors filled out a survey to assess different types of explanations. Further, an interview was carried out post-survey to gain qualitative insights on the requirements of explanations incorporated in diagnostic decision support. Overall, the insights gained from this study contribute to understanding the types of explanations that are most effective.",

However, existing works are limited to pure simulations or are constrained by predefined workflows, restricting their applicability and effectiveness.

MASS achieves stable and continuous excess returns by progressively increasing the number of agents for large-scale simulations to gain a superior understanding of the market and optimizing agent distribution end-to-end through a reverse optimization process, rather than relying on a fixed workflow. We demonstrate its superiority through performance experiments, ablation studies, backtesting experiments, experiments on updated data and stock pools, scaling experiments, parameter sensitivity experiments, and visualization experiments, conducted in comparison with 6 state-of-the-art baselines on 3 challenging A-share stock pools. We expect the paradigm established by MASS to expand to other tasks with similar characteristics. The implementation of MASS has been open-sourced at this https URL.",

    "summary": "Commonsense intelligence in machines is often assessed by static benchmarks that compare a model's output against human-prescribed correct labels. An important, albeit implicit, assumption of these labels is that they accurately capture what any human would think, effectively treating human common sense as homogeneous. However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary enormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident to one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a novel method for evaluating common sense in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically observed heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a model's judgment and that of a human population. We first find that, when treated as independent survey respondents, most LLMs remain below the human median in their individual commonsense competence. Second, when used as simulators of a hypothetical population, LLMs correlate with real humans only modestly in the extent to which they agree on the same set of statements. In both cases, smaller, open-weight models are surprisingly more competitive than larger, proprietary frontier models. Our evaluation framework, which ties commonsense intelligence to its cultural basis, contributes to the growing call for adapting AI models to human collectivities that possess different, often incompatible, social stocks of knowledge.",

    "summary": "The effects of personnel scheduling on the quality of care and working conditions for healthcare personnel have been thoroughly documented. However, the ever-present demand and large variation of constraints make healthcare scheduling particularly challenging. This problem has been studied for decades, with limited research aimed at applying Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). SMT has gained momentum within the formal verification community in the last decades, leading to the advancement of SMT solvers that have been shown to outperform standard mathematical programming techniques.\nIn this work, we propose generic constraint formulations that can model a wide range of real-world scheduling constraints. Then, the generic constraints are formulated as SMT and MILP problems and used to compare the respective state-of-the-art solvers, Z3 and Gurobi, on academic and real-world inspired rostering problems. Experimental results show how each solver excels for certain types of problems; the MILP solver generally performs better when the problem is highly constrained or infeasible, while the SMT solver performs better otherwise. On real-world inspired problems containing a more varied set of shifts and personnel, the SMT solver excels. Additionally, it was noted during experimentation that the SMT solver was more sensitive to the way the generic constraints were formulated, requiring careful consideration and experimentation to achieve better performance. We conclude that SMT-based methods present a promising avenue for future research within the domain of personnel scheduling.",

    "summary": "Agents are minimally entities that are influenced by their past observations and act to influence future observations. This latter capacity is captured by empowerment, which has served as a vital framing concept across artificial intelligence and cognitive science. This former capacity, however, is equally foundational: In what ways, and to what extent, can an agent be influenced by what it observes? In this paper, we ground this concept in a universal agent-centric measure that we refer to as plasticity, and reveal a fundamental connection to empowerment. Following a set of desiderata on a suitable definition, we define plasticity using a new information-theoretic quantity we call the generalized directed information. We show that this new quantity strictly generalizes the directed information introduced by Massey (1990) while preserving all of its desirable properties. Our first finding is that plasticity is the mirror of empowerment: The agent's plasticity is identical to the empowerment of the environment, and vice versa. Our second finding establishes a tension between the plasticity and empowerment of an agent, suggesting that agent design needs to be mindful of both characteristics. We explore the implications of these findings, and suggest that plasticity, empowerment, and their relationship are essential to understanding agency.",

Current explanation evaluation frameworks measure quality by comparing against ideal \"ground-truth\" explanations, or by verifying model sensitivity to important inputs. We outline the limitations of these approaches, and propose three desirable principles to ground the future development of explanation evaluation strategies for local feature importance explanations. We propose a ground-truth Agnostic eXplanation Evaluation framework (AXE) for evaluating and comparing model explanations that satisfies these principles. Unlike prior approaches, AXE does not require access to ideal ground-truth explanations for comparison, or rely on model sensitivity - providing an independent measure of explanation quality.

    "summary": "This study critically distinguishes between AI Agents and Agentic AI, offering a structured conceptual taxonomy, application mapping, and challenge analysis to clarify their divergent design philosophies and capabilities. We begin by outlining the search strategy and foundational definitions, characterizing AI Agents as modular systems driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Image Models (LIMs) for narrow, task-specific automation. Generative AI is positioned as a precursor, with AI Agents advancing through tool integration, prompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements. In contrast, Agentic AI systems represent a paradigmatic shift marked by multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and orchestrated autonomy. Through a sequential evaluation of architectural evolution, operational mechanisms, interaction styles, and autonomy levels, we present a comparative analysis across both paradigms. Application domains such as customer support, scheduling, and data summarization are contrasted with Agentic AI deployments in research automation, robotic coordination, and medical decision support. We further examine unique challenges in each paradigm including hallucination, brittleness, emergent behavior, and coordination failure and propose targeted solutions such as ReAct loops, RAG, orchestration layers, and causal modeling. This work aims to provide a definitive roadmap for developing robust, scalable, and explainable AI agent and Agentic AI-driven systems. >AI Agents, Agent-driven, Vision-Language-Models, Agentic AI Decision Support System, Agentic-AI Applications",

    "summary": "While large language models demonstrate impressive performance on static benchmarks, the true potential of large language models as self-learning and reasoning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. This study systematically evaluates the efficacy of self-reflection, heuristic mutation, and planning as prompting techniques to test the adaptive capabilities of agents. We conduct experiments with various open-source language models in dynamic environments and find that larger models generally outperform smaller ones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, a too-long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks, while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting techniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less improvement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making align, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops. Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits persistent limitations in crucial areas such as planning, reasoning, and spatial coordination, suggesting that current-generation large language models still suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through self-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while reasoning methods like Chain of thought improves multi-step reasoning on math word problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important shortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move beyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning.",

    "summary": "One-shot medical landmark detection gains much attention and achieves great success for its label-efficient training process. However, existing one-shot learning methods are highly specialized in a single domain and suffer domain preference heavily in the situation of multi-domain unlabeled data. Moreover, one-shot learning is not robust that it faces performance drop when annotating a sub-optimal image. To tackle these issues, we resort to developing a domain-adaptive one-shot landmark detection framework for handling multi-domain medical images, named Universal One-shot Detection (UOD). UOD consists of two stages and two corresponding universal models which are designed as combinations of domain-specific modules and domain-shared modules. In the first stage, a domain-adaptive convolution model is self-supervised learned to generate pseudo landmark labels. In the second stage, we design a domain-adaptive transformer to eliminate domain preference and build the global context for multi-domain data. Even though only one annotated sample from each domain is available for training, the domain-shared modules help UOD aggregate all one-shot samples to detect more robust and accurate landmarks. We investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively the proposed UOD on three widely-used public X-ray datasets in different anatomical domains (i.e., head, hand, chest) and obtained state-of-the-art performances in each domain.

    "summary": "We present Kernel-QuantTree Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (KQT-EWMA), a non-parametric change-detection algorithm that combines the Kernel-QuantTree (KQT) histogram and the EWMA statistic to monitor multivariate data streams online. The resulting monitoring scheme is very flexible, since histograms can be used to model any stationary distribution, and practical, since the distribution of test statistics does not depend on the distribution of datastream in stationary conditions (non-parametric monitoring). KQT-EWMA enables controlling false alarms by operating at a pre-determined Average Run Length ($ARL_0$), which measures the expected number of stationary samples to be monitored before triggering a false alarm. The latter peculiarity is in contrast with most non-parametric change-detection tests, which rarely can control the $ARL_0$ a priori. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that KQT-EWMA can control $ARL_0$ while achieving detection delays comparable to or lower than state-of-the-art methods designed to work in the same conditions.",

    "summary": "The introduction of multimodal models is a huge step forward in Artificial Intelligence. A single model is trained to understand multiple modalities: text, image, video, and audio. Open-source multimodal models have made these breakthroughs more accessible. However, considering the vast landscape of adversarial attacks across these modalities, these models also inherit vulnerabilities of all the modalities, and ultimately, the adversarial threat amplifies. While broad research is available on possible attacks within or across these modalities, a practitioner-focused view that outlines attack types remains absent in the multimodal world. As more Machine Learning Practitioners adopt, fine-tune, and deploy open-source models in real-world applications, it's crucial that they can view the threat landscape and take the preventive actions necessary. This paper addresses the gap by surveying adversarial attacks targeting all four modalities: text, image, video, and audio. This survey provides a view of the adversarial attack landscape and presents how multimodal adversarial threats have evolved. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive summarization of the threat landscape in the multimodal world.",

    "summary": "The management of chronic Heart Failure (HF) presents significant challenges in modern healthcare, requiring continuous monitoring, early detection of exacerbations, and personalized treatment strategies. In this paper, we present a predictive model founded on Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify patients at HF risk. This model is an ensemble learning approach, a modified stacking technique, that uses two specialized models leveraging clinical and echocardiographic features and then a meta-model to combine the predictions of these two models. We initially assess the model on a real dataset and the obtained results suggest that it performs well in the stratification of patients at HR risk. Specifically, we obtained high sensitivity (95\\%), ensuring that nearly all high-risk patients are identified. As for accuracy, we obtained 84\\%, which can be considered moderate in some ML contexts. However, it is acceptable given our priority of identifying patients at risk of HF because they will be asked to participate in the telemonitoring program of the PrediHealth research project on which some of the authors of this paper are working. The initial findings also suggest that ML-based risk stratification models can serve as valuable decision-support tools not only in the PrediHealth project but also for healthcare professionals, aiding in early intervention and personalized patient management. To have a better understanding of the value and of potentiality of our predictive model, we also contrasted its results with those obtained by using three baseline models. The preliminary results indicate that our predictive model outperforms these baselines that flatly consider features, \\ie not grouping them in clinical and echocardiographic features.",

In aDBS, a surgically placed electrode sends dynamically altered stimuli to the brain based on neurophysiological feedback: an invasive gadget that limits the amount of data one could collect for optimizing the control offline. As a consequence, a plethora of synthetic models of PD and those of the control algorithms have been proposed. Herein, we introduce the first neurophysiologically realistic benchmark for comparing said models. Specifically, our methodology covers not only conventional basal ganglia circuit dynamics and pathological oscillations, but also captures 15 previously dismissed physiological attributes, such as signal instabilities and noise, neural drift, electrode conductance changes and individual variability - all modeled as spatially distributed and temporally registered features via beta-band activity in the brain and a feedback. Furthermore, we purposely built our framework as a structured environment for training and evaluating deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, opening new possibilities for optimizing aDBS control strategies and inviting the machine learning community to contribute to the emerging field of intelligent neurostimulation interfaces.",

By investigating cosmic signal delay, neurological reaction times, and the ancient cognitive state of stillness, we explore how one may shift from reactive perception to a conscious interface with the near future. This paper introduces both a physical and cognitive model for perceiving the present not as a linear timestamp, but as an interference zone where early-arriving cosmic signals and reactive human delays intersect. We propose experimental approaches to test these ideas using human neural observation and neuro-receptive extensions. Finally, we propose a mathematical framework to guide the evolution of AI systems toward temporally efficient, ethically sound, and internally conscious decision-making processes",

    "summary": "Location Intelligence (LI), the science of transforming location-centric geospatial data into actionable knowledge, has become a cornerstone of modern spatial decision-making. The rapid evolution of Geospatial Representation Learning is fundamentally reshaping LI development through two successive technological revolutions: the deep learning breakthrough and the emerging large language model (LLM) paradigm. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in automated feature extraction from structured geospatial data (e.g., satellite imagery, GPS trajectories), the recent integration of LLMs introduces transformative capabilities for cross-modal geospatial reasoning and unstructured geo-textual data processing. This survey presents a comprehensive review of geospatial representation learning across both technological eras, organizing them into a structured taxonomy based on the complete pipeline comprising: (1) data perspective, (2) methodological perspective and (3) application perspective. We also highlight current advancements, discuss existing limitations, and propose potential future research directions in the LLM era. This work offers a thorough exploration of the field and providing a roadmap for further innovation in LI.

    "summary": "The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have led to the emergence of quantum machine learning (QML), which integrates the strengths of both fields. Among QML approaches, variational quantum circuits (VQCs), also known as quantum neural networks (QNNs), have shown promise both empirically and theoretically. However, their broader adoption is hindered by reliance on quantum hardware during inference. Hardware imperfections and limited access to quantum devices pose practical challenges. To address this, the Quantum-Train (QT) framework leverages the exponential scaling of quantum amplitudes to generate classical neural network parameters, enabling inference without quantum hardware and achieving significant parameter compression. Yet, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for such quantum-enhanced neural programmers remains non-trivial and often requires expertise in quantum information science. In this paper, we propose an automated solution using differentiable optimization. Our method jointly optimizes both conventional circuit parameters and architectural parameters in an end-to-end manner via automatic differentiation. We evaluate the proposed framework on classification, time-series prediction, and reinforcement learning tasks. Simulation results show that our method matches or outperforms manually designed QNN architectures. This work offers a scalable and automated pathway for designing QNNs that can generate classical neural network parameters across diverse applications.",

In this task, voice timbre is explained with a set of sensory attributes describing its human perception. A pair of speech utterances is processed, and their intensity is compared in a designated timbre descriptor. Moreover, a framework is proposed, which is built upon the speaker embeddings extracted from the speech utterances. The investigation is conducted on the VCTK-RVA dataset. Experimental examinations on the ECAPA-TDNN and FACodec speaker encoders demonstrated that: 1) the ECAPA-TDNN speaker encoder was more capable in the seen scenario, where the testing speakers were included in the training set; 2) the FACodec speaker encoder was superior in the unseen scenario, where the testing speakers were not part of the training, indicating enhanced generalization capability.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, with optimizing their input prompts playing a pivotal role in maximizing their performance. However, while LLM prompts consist of both the task-agnostic system prompts and task-specific user prompts, existing work on prompt optimization has focused on user prompts specific to individual queries or tasks, and largely overlooked the system prompt that is, once optimized, applicable across different tasks and domains. Motivated by this, we introduce the novel problem of bilevel system prompt optimization, whose objective is to design system prompts that are robust to diverse user prompts and transferable to unseen tasks. To tackle this problem, we then propose a meta-learning framework, which meta-learns the system prompt by optimizing it over various user prompts across multiple datasets, while simultaneously updating the user prompts in an iterative manner to ensure synergy between them. We conduct experiments on 14 unseen datasets spanning 5 different domains, on which we show that our approach produces system prompts that generalize effectively to diverse user prompts. Also, our findings reveal that the optimized system prompt enables rapid adaptation even to unseen tasks, requiring fewer optimization steps for test-time user prompts while achieving improved performance.",

In robotic manipulation, VLMs are used primarily as high-level planners, but recent work has also studied their lower-level reasoning ability, which refers to making decisions about precise robot movements. However, the community currently lacks a clear and common benchmark that can evaluate how well VLMs can aid low-level reasoning in robotics. Consequently, we propose a novel benchmark, ManipBench, to evaluate the low-level robot manipulation reasoning capabilities of VLMs across various dimensions, including how well they understand object-object interactions and deformable object manipulation. We extensively test 33 representative VLMs across 10 model families on our benchmark, including variants to test different model sizes. Our evaluation shows that the performance of VLMs significantly varies across tasks, and there is a strong correlation between this performance and trends in our real-world manipulation tasks. It also shows that there remains a significant gap between these models and human-level understanding. See our website at: this https URL.",

This study examines the energy consumed during the FL process, focusing on three main energy-intensive processes: pre-processing, communication, and local learning, all contributing to the overall energy footprint. We rely on the observation that device/client selection is crucial for speeding up the convergence of model training in a distributed AIoT setting and propose two clustering-informed methods. These clustering solutions are designed to group AIoT devices with similar label distributions, resulting in clusters composed of nearly heterogeneous devices. Hence, our methods alleviate the heterogeneity often encountered in real-world distributed learning applications. Throughout extensive numerical experimentation, we demonstrate that our clustering strategies typically achieve high convergence rates while maintaining low energy consumption when compared to other recent approaches available in the literature.",

    "summary": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation is considered a hallmark of human and animal intelligence. To achieve OOD through composition, a system must discover the environment-invariant properties of experienced input-output mappings and transfer them to novel inputs. This can be realised if an intelligent system can identify appropriate, task-invariant, and composable input features, as well as the composition methods, thus allowing it to act based not on the interpolation between learnt data points but on the task-invariant composition of those features. We propose that in order to confirm that an algorithm does indeed learn compositional structures from data, it is not enough to just test on an OOD setup, but one also needs to confirm that the features identified are indeed compositional. We showcase this by exploring two tasks with clearly defined OOD metrics that are not OOD solvable by three commonly used neural networks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Transformer. In addition, we develop two novel network architectures imbued with biases that allow them to be successful in OOD scenarios. We show that even with correct biases and almost perfect OOD performance, an algorithm can still fail to learn the correct features for compositional generalisation.",

However, data quality issues such as noisy labels, missing classes, and imbalanced distributions significantly challenge its effectiveness. This study proposes a federated learning methodology that systematically addresses data quality issues, including noise, class imbalance, and missing labels. The proposed approach systematically enhances data integrity through adaptive noise cleaning, collaborative conditional GAN-based synthetic data generation, and robust federated model training. Experimental evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets (MNIST and Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate significant improvements in federated model performance, particularly macro-F1 Score, under varying noise and class imbalance conditions. Additionally, the proposed framework carefully balances computational feasibility and substantial performance gains, ensuring practicality for resource constrained edge devices while rigorously maintaining data privacy.

    "summary": "Pretrained language models (LLMs) are often constrained by their fixed tokenization schemes, leading to inefficiencies and performance limitations, particularly for multilingual or specialized applications. This tokenizer lock-in presents significant challenges. standard methods to overcome this often require prohibitive computational resources. Although tokenizer replacement with heuristic initialization aims to reduce this burden, existing methods often require exhaustive residual fine-tuning and still may not fully preserve semantic nuances or adequately address the underlying compression inefficiencies. Our framework introduces two innovations: first, Tokenadapt, a model-agnostic tokenizer transplantation method, and second, novel pre-tokenization learning for multi-word Supertokens to enhance compression and reduce fragmentation. Tokenadapt initializes new unique token embeddings via a hybrid heuristic that combines two methods: a local estimate based on subword decomposition using the old tokenizer, and a global estimate utilizing the top-k semantically similar tokens from the original vocabulary. This methodology aims to preserve semantics while significantly minimizing retraining requirements. Empirical investigations validate both contributions: the transplantation heuristic successfully initializes unique tokens, markedly outperforming conventional baselines and sophisticated methods including Transtokenizer and ReTok, while our Supertokens achieve notable compression gains. Our zero-shot perplexity results demonstrate that the TokenAdapt hybrid initialization consistently yields lower perplexity ratios compared to both ReTok and TransTokenizer baselines across different base models and newly trained target tokenizers. TokenAdapt typically reduced the overall perplexity ratio significantly compared to ReTok, yielding at least a 2-fold improvement in these aggregate scores.",

Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard, the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively \"opening\" the black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.",

In such cases, distrust in the system may be justified and necessary to build meaningful trust in the first place. We propose the term \"healthy distrust\" to describe such a justified, careful stance towards certain AI usage practices.

    "summary": "This work presents a methodology for reconstructing the spatial distribution of the neutron flux in a nuclear reactor, leveraging real-time measurements obtained from ex-core detectors. The Kirchhoff-Helmholtz (K-H) equation inherently defines the problem of estimating a scalar field within a domain based on boundary data, making it a natural mathematical framework for this task. The main challenge lies in deriving the Green's function specific to the domain and the neutron diffusion process. While analytical solutions for Green's functions exist for simplified geometries, their derivation of complex, heterogeneous domains-such as a nuclear reactor-requires a numerical approach. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the well-posedness of the data-driven Green's function approximation by formulating and solving the K-H equation as an inverse problem. After establishing the symmetry properties that the Green's function must satisfy, the K-H equation is derived from the one-speed neutron diffusion model.

    "summary": "Research projects, including those focused on cancer, rely on the manual extraction of information from clinical reports. This process is time-consuming and prone to errors, limiting the efficiency of data-driven approaches in healthcare. To address these challenges, Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers an alternative for automating the extraction of relevant data from electronic health records (EHRs). In this study, we focus on lung and breast cancer due to their high incidence and the significant impact they have on public health. Early detection and effective data management in both types of cancer are crucial for improving patient outcomes. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of data extraction, we utilized GMV's NLP tool uQuery, which excels at identifying relevant entities in clinical texts and converting them into standardized formats such as SNOMED and OMOP. uQuery not only detects and classifies entities but also associates them with contextual information, including negated entities, temporal aspects, and patient-related details. In this work, we explore the use of NLP techniques, specifically Named Entity Recognition (NER), to automatically identify and extract key clinical information from EHRs related to these two cancers. A dataset from Health Research Institute Hospital La Fe (IIS La Fe), comprising 200 annotated breast cancer and 400 lung cancer reports, was used, with eight clinical entities manually labeled using the Doccano platform. To perform NER, we fine-tuned the bsc-bio-ehr-en3 model, a RoBERTa-based biomedical linguistic model pre-trained in Spanish. Fine-tuning was performed using the Transformers architecture, enabling accurate recognition of clinical entities in these cancer types. Our results demonstrate strong overall performance, particularly in identifying entities like MET and PAT, although challenges remain with less frequent entities like EVOL.",

However, the current clinic-based paradigm does not support these needs. To address this, we have developed 'Virtual Dosimetrist' models that can both generate training examples of suboptimal treatment plans and then allow trainees to improve the plan quality through simple natural language prompts, as if communicating with a dosimetrist. The dose generation and modification process is accurate, rapid, and requires only modest resources. This work is the first to combine dose distribution prediction with natural language processing; providing a robust pipeline for both generating suboptimal training plans and allowing trainees to practice their critical plan review and improvement skills that addresses the challenges of the current clinic-based paradigm.",

Traditional clustering methods struggle with high-dimensional, heterogeneous healthcare data and lack contextual understanding. This study evaluates Large Language Model (LLM) based clustering against classical methods using a pediatric sepsis dataset from a low-income country (LIC), containing 2,686 records with 28 numerical and 119 categorical variables. Patient records were serialized into text with and without a clustering objective. Embeddings were generated using quantized LLAMA 3.1 8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B with low-rank adaptation(LoRA), and Stella-En-400M-V5 models. K-means clustering was applied to these embeddings. Classical comparisons included K-Medoids clustering on UMAP and FAMD-reduced mixed data. Silhouette scores and statistical tests evaluated cluster quality and distinctiveness. Stella-En-400M-V5 achieved the highest Silhouette Score (0.86). LLAMA 3.1 8B with the clustering objective performed better with higher number of clusters, identifying subgroups with distinct nutritional, clinical, and socioeconomic profiles. LLM-based methods outperformed classical techniques by capturing richer context and prioritizing key features. These results highlight potential of LLMs for contextual phenotyping and informed decision-making in resource-limited settings.",

    "summary": "Several recent works argue that LLMs have a universal truth direction where true and false statements are linearly separable in the activation space of the model. It has been demonstrated that linear probes trained on a single hidden state of the model already generalize across a range of topics and might even be used for lie detection in LLM conversations. In this work we explore how this truth direction generalizes between various conversational formats. We find good generalization between short conversations that end on a lie, but poor generalization to longer formats where the lie appears earlier in the input prompt. We propose a solution that significantly improves this type of generalization by adding a fixed key phrase at the end of each conversation. Our results highlight the challenges towards reliable LLM lie detectors that generalize to new settings.",

We investigate whether LLMs possess meaningful parametric knowledge-encoded in their pretrained weights-to predict conflict escalation and fatalities without external data. This is critical for early warning systems, humanitarian planning, and policy-making. We compare this parametric knowledge with non-parametric capabilities, where LLMs access structured and unstructured context from conflict datasets (e.g., ACLED, GDELT) and recent news reports via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Incorporating external information could enhance model performance by providing up-to-date context otherwise missing from pretrained weights. Our two-part evaluation framework spans 2020-2024 across conflict-prone regions in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. In the parametric setting, LLMs predict conflict trends and fatalities relying only on pretrained knowledge. In the non-parametric setting, models receive summaries of recent conflict events, indicators, and geopolitical developments. We compare predicted conflict trend labels (e.g., Escalate, Stable Conflict, De-escalate, Peace) and fatalities against historical data. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs for conflict forecasting and the benefits of augmenting them with structured external knowledge.",

    "summary": "Transformer models learn in two distinct modes: in-weights learning (IWL), encoding knowledge into model weights, and in-context learning (ICL), adapting flexibly to context without weight modification. To better understand the interplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary biology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL, adapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and phenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to environmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability dictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic encoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We experimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and systematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in Transformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high environmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp transition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL efficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics reveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift occurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we demonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL acquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding to ICL dominance. These findings support a relative-cost hypothesis for explaining these learning mode transitions, establishing predictability as a critical factor governing adaptive strategies in Transformers, and offering novel insights for understanding ICL and guiding training methodologies.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate or automate human behavior in complex sequential decision-making tasks. A natural question is then whether LLMs exhibit similar decision-making behavior to humans, and can achieve comparable (or superior) performance. In this work, we focus on the exploration-exploitation (E&E) tradeoff, a fundamental aspect of dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. We employ canonical multi-armed bandit (MAB) tasks introduced in the cognitive science and psychiatry literature to conduct a comparative study of the E&E strategies of LLMs, humans, and MAB algorithms. We use interpretable choice models to capture the E&E strategies of the agents and investigate how explicit reasoning, through both prompting strategies and reasoning-enhanced models, shapes LLM decision-making. We find that reasoning shifts LLMs toward more human-like behavior, characterized by a mix of random and directed exploration. In simple stationary tasks, reasoning-enabled LLMs exhibit similar levels of random and directed exploration compared to humans. However, in more complex, non-stationary environments, LLMs struggle to match human adaptability, particularly in effective directed exploration, despite achieving similar regret in certain scenarios. Our findings highlight both the promise and limits of LLMs as simulators of human behavior and tools for automated decision-making and point to potential areas of improvements.",

    "summary": "With the growing demand for healthy foods, agricultural product price forecasting has become increasingly important. Hass avocados, as a high-value crop, exhibit complex price fluctuations influenced by factors such as seasonality, region, and weather. Traditional prediction models often struggle with highly nonlinear and dynamic data. To address this, we propose a hybrid deep learning model, TCN-MLP-Attention Architecture, combining Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) for sequential feature extraction, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for nonlinear interactions, and an Attention mechanism for dynamic feature weighting. The dataset used covers over 50,000 records of Hass avocado sales across the U.S. from 2015 to 2018, including variables such as sales volume, average price, time, region, weather, and variety type, collected from point-of-sale systems and the Hass Avocado Board. After systematic preprocessing, including missing value imputation and feature normalization, the proposed model was trained and evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate that the TCN-MLP-Attention model achieves excellent predictive performance, with an RMSE of 1.23 and an MSE of 1.51, outperforming traditional methods. This research provides a scalable and effective approach for time series forecasting in agricultural markets and offers valuable insights for intelligent supply chain management and price strategy optimization.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces an interactive continual learning paradigm where AI models dynamically learn new skills from real-time human feedback while retaining prior knowledge. This paradigm distinctively addresses two major limitations of traditional continual learning: (1) dynamic model updates using streaming, real-time human-annotated data, rather than static datasets with fixed labels, and (2) the assumption of clean labels, by explicitly handling the noisy feedback common in real-world interactions. To tackle these problems, we propose RiCL, a Reinforced interactive Continual Learning framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn new skills effectively from dynamic feedback. RiCL incorporates three key components: a temporal consistency-aware purifier to automatically discern clean from noisy samples in data streams; an interaction-aware direct preference optimization strategy to align model behavior with human intent by reconciling AI-generated and human-provided feedback; and a noise-resistant contrastive learning module that captures robust representations by exploiting inherent data relationships, thus avoiding reliance on potentially unreliable labels. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (FewRel and TACRED), contaminated with realistic noise patterns, demonstrate that our RiCL approach substantially outperforms existing combinations of state-of-the-art online continual learning and noisy-label learning methods.",

    "summary": "Universal visual anomaly detection aims to identify anomalies from novel or unseen vision domains without additional fine-tuning, which is critical in open scenarios. Recent studies have demonstrated that pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP exhibit strong generalization with just zero or a few normal images. However, existing methods struggle with designing prompt templates, complex token interactions, or requiring additional fine-tuning, resulting in limited flexibility. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method called AdaptCLIP based on two key insights. First, adaptive visual and textual representations should be learned alternately rather than jointly. Second, comparative learning between query and normal image prompt should incorporate both contextual and aligned residual features, rather than relying solely on residual features. AdaptCLIP treats CLIP models as a foundational service, adding only three simple adapters, visual adapter, textual adapter, and prompt-query adapter, at its input or output ends. AdaptCLIP supports zero-/few-shot generalization across domains and possesses a training-free manner on target domains once trained on a base dataset. AdaptCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on 12 anomaly detection benchmarks from industrial and medical domains, significantly outperforming existing competitive methods. We will make the code and model of AdaptCLIP available at this https URL.",

    "summary": "Understanding and predicting human behavior in-thewild, particularly at urban intersections, remains crucial for enhancing interaction safety between road users. Among the most critical behaviors are crossing intentions of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs), where misinterpretation may result in dangerous conflicts with oncoming vehicles. In this work, we propose the VRU-CIPI framework with a sequential attention-based model designed to predict VRU crossing intentions at intersections. VRU-CIPI employs Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture temporal dynamics in VRU movements, combined with a multi-head Transformer self-attention mechanism to encode contextual and spatial dependencies critical for predicting crossing direction. Evaluated on UCF-VRU dataset, our proposed achieves state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 96.45% and achieving real-time inference speed reaching 33 frames per second. Furthermore, by integrating with Infrastructure-to-Vehicles (I2V) communication, our approach can proactively enhance intersection safety through timely activation of crossing signals and providing early warnings to connected vehicles, ensuring smoother and safer interactions for all road users.",

    "summary": "The advent of large language models (LLMs) has allowed numerous applications, including the generation of queried responses, to be leveraged in chatbots and other conversational assistants. Being trained on a plethora of data, LLMs often undergo high levels of over-fitting, resulting in the generation of extra and incorrect data, thus causing hallucinations in output generation. One of the root causes of such problems is the lack of timely, factual, and personalized information fed to the LLM. In this paper, we propose an approach to address these problems by introducing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist the LLM in personalized response generation tailored to the users. KGs have the advantage of storing continuously updated factual information in a structured way. While our KGs can be used for a variety of frequently updated personal data, such as calendar, contact, and location data, we focus on calendar data in this paper. Our experimental results show that our approach works significantly better in understanding personal information and generating accurate responses compared to the baseline LLMs using personal data as text inputs, with a moderate reduction in response time.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we focus on a long-term continual learning (CL) task, where a model learns sequentially from a stream of vast tasks over time, acquiring new knowledge while retaining previously learned information in a manner akin to human learning. Unlike traditional CL settings, long-term CL involves handling a significantly larger number of tasks, which exacerbates the issue of catastrophic forgetting. Our work seeks to address two critical questions: 1) How do existing CL methods perform in the context of long-term CL? and 2) How can we mitigate the catastrophic forgetting that arises from prolonged sequential updates? To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework inspired by human memory mechanisms for long-term continual learning (Long-CL). Specifically, we introduce a task-core memory management strategy to efficiently index crucial memories and adaptively update them as learning progresses. Additionally, we develop a long-term memory consolidation mechanism that selectively retains hard and discriminative samples, ensuring robust knowledge retention. To facilitate research in this area, we construct and release two multi-modal and textual benchmarks, MMLongCL-Bench and TextLongCL-Bench, providing a valuable resource for evaluating long-term CL approaches. Experimental results show that Long-CL outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 7.4\\% and 6.5\\% AP on the two benchmarks, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "summary": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for time series data remains a critical challenge in deep learning, with traditional pseudo-labeling strategies failing to capture temporal patterns and channel-wise shifts between domains, producing sub-optimal pseudo-labels. As such, we introduce TransPL, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by modeling the joint distribution $P(\\mathbf{X}, y)$ of the source domain through code transition matrices, where the codes are derived from vector quantization (VQ) of time series patches. Our method constructs class- and channel-wise code transition matrices from the source domain and employs Bayes' rule for target domain adaptation, generating pseudo-labels based on channel-wise weighted class-conditional likelihoods. TransPL offers three key advantages: explicit modeling of temporal transitions and channel-wise shifts between different domains, versatility towards different UDA scenarios (e.g., weakly-supervised UDA), and explainable pseudo-label generation. We validate TransPL's effectiveness through extensive analysis on four time series UDA benchmarks and confirm that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pseudo-labeling methods by a strong margin (6.1% accuracy improvement, 4.9% F1 improvement), while providing interpretable insights into the domain adaptation process through its learned code transition matrices.",

We present a systematic evaluation of safety risks in fine-tuned LLMs for cyber security applications. Using the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications framework, we assessed seven open-source LLMs: Phi 3 Mini 3.8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Llama 3 8B, Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 2 70B. Our evaluation shows that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all tested LLMs (e.g., the safety score of Llama 3.1 8B against prompt injection drops from 0.95 to 0.15). We propose and evaluate a safety alignment approach that carefully rewords instruction-response pairs to include explicit safety precautions and ethical considerations. This approach demonstrates that it is possible to maintain or even improve model safety while preserving technical utility, offering a practical path forward for developing safer fine-tuning methodologies.

    "summary": "This paper evaluates the performance of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in the low-resource Pashto language. Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Pashto faces several challenges due to the cursive nature of its script and a scarcity of structured datasets. To address this, we developed a synthetic Pashto OCR dataset, PsOCR, consisting of one million images annotated with bounding boxes at word, line, and document levels, suitable for training and evaluating models based on different architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. PsOCR covers variations across 1,000 unique font families, colors, image sizes, and layouts. A benchmark subset of 10K images was selected to evaluate the performance of several LMMs, including seven open-source models: DeepSeek's Janus, InternVL, MiniCPM, Florence, and Qwen (3B and 7B), and four closed-source models: GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, and Grok. Experimental results demonstrate that Gemini achieves the best performance among all models, whereas among open-source models, Qwen-7B stands out. This work provides an insightful assessment of the capabilities and limitations of current LMMs for OCR tasks in Pashto and establishes a foundation for further research not only in Pashto OCR but also for other similar scripts such as Arabic, Persian, and Urdu. PsOCR is available at this https URL.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly reshape modern life, advancing fields from healthcare to education and beyond. However, alongside their remarkable capabilities lies a significant threat: the susceptibility of these models to jailbreaking. The fundamental vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks stems from the very data they learn from. As long as this training data includes unfiltered, problematic, or 'dark' content, the models can inherently learn undesirable patterns or weaknesses that allow users to circumvent their intended safety controls. Our research identifies the growing threat posed by dark LLMs models deliberately designed without ethical guardrails or modified through jailbreak techniques. In our research, we uncovered a universal jailbreak attack that effectively compromises multiple state-of-the-art models, enabling them to answer almost any question and produce harmful outputs upon request. The main idea of our attack was published online over seven months ago. However, many of the tested LLMs were still vulnerable to this attack. Despite our responsible disclosure efforts, responses from major LLM providers were often inadequate, highlighting a concerning gap in industry practices regarding AI safety. As model training becomes more accessible and cheaper, and as open-source LLMs proliferate, the risk of widespread misuse escalates. Without decisive intervention, LLMs may continue democratizing access to dangerous knowledge, posing greater risks than anticipated.",

    "summary": "In this paper, a novel framework is presented that achieves a combined solution based on Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) and collision avoidance with respect to homogeneous measurement tasks taking place in industrial environments. The spatial clustering we propose offers to simultaneously solve the task allocation problem and deal with collision risks by cutting the workspace into distinguishable operational zones for each robot. To divide task sites and to schedule robot routes within corresponding clusters, we use K-means clustering and the 2-Opt algorithm. The presented framework shows satisfactory performance, where up to 93\\% time reduction (1.24s against 17.62s) with a solution quality improvement of up to 7\\% compared to the best performing method is demonstrated. Our method also completely eliminates collision points that persist in comparative methods in a most significant sense. Theoretical analysis agrees with the claim that spatial partitioning unifies the apparently disjoint tasks allocation and collision avoidance problems under conditions of many identical tasks to be distributed over sparse geographical areas. Ultimately, the findings in this work are of substantial importance for real world applications where both computational efficiency and operation free from collisions is of paramount importance.",

Current approaches suffer from significant domain gaps between training datasets and robot manipulation tasks, while also lacking model architectures that can effectively incorporate 3D information. To overcome these limitations, we enhance the DROID dataset with high-quality depth maps and point clouds, constructing DROID-3D as a valuable supplement for 3D embodied vision research. Then we develop EmbodiedMAE, a multi-modal masked autoencoder that simultaneously learns representations across RGB, depth, and point cloud modalities through stochastic masking and cross-modal fusion. Trained on DROID-3D, EmbodiedMAE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art vision foundation models (VFMs) in both training efficiency and final performance across 70 simulation tasks and 20 real-world robot manipulation tasks on two robot platforms. The model exhibits strong scaling behavior with size and promotes effective policy learning from 3D inputs. Experimental results establish EmbodiedMAE as a reliable unified 3D multi-modal VFM for embodied AI systems, particularly in precise tabletop manipulation settings where spatial perception is critical.",

Recent advancements have demonstrated that pretrained models can generate efficient molecular embeddings. However, these approaches often require extensive pretraining and additional techniques, such as incorporating posterior probabilities, to boost performance. In our study, we propose a novel strategy that jointly trains a single Graph Transformer neural network on both sparse multitask molecular property experimental targets and synthetic targets derived from XGBoost models trained on Osmordred molecular descriptors. These synthetic tasks serve as independent auxiliary tasks. Our results show consistent and significant performance improvement across all 19 molecular property prediction tasks. For 16 out of 19 targets, the multitask Graph Transformer outperforms the XGBoost single-task learner. This demonstrates that synthetic task augmentation is an effective method for enhancing neural model performance in multitask molecular property prediction without the need for feature injection or pretraining.",

However, FL faces significant challenges due to statistical heterogeneity, particularly domain heterogeneity, which impedes the global mode's convergence. In this study, we introduce a new framework to address this challenge by improving the generalization ability of the FL global model under domain heterogeneity, using prototype augmentation. Specifically, we introduce FedAPC (Federated Augmented Prototype Contrastive Learning), a prototype-based FL framework designed to enhance feature diversity and model robustness. FedAPC leverages prototypes derived from the mean features of augmented data to capture richer representations. By aligning local features with global prototypes, we enable the model to learn meaningful semantic features while reducing overfitting to any specific domain. Experimental results on the Office-10 and Digits datasets illustrate that our framework outperforms SOTA baselines, demonstrating superior performance.",

    "summary": "Accurate and robust localization is a critical enabler for emerging 5G and 6G applications, including autonomous driving, extended reality (XR), and smart manufacturing. While data-driven approaches have shown promise, most existing models require large amounts of labeled data and struggle to generalize across deployment scenarios and wireless configurations. To address these limitations, we propose a foundation-model-based solution tailored for wireless localization. We first analyze how different self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks acquire general-purpose and task-specific semantic features based on information bottleneck (IB) theory. Building on this foundation, we design a pretraining methodology for the proposed Large Wireless Localization Model (LWLM). Specifically, we propose an SSL framework that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) spatial-frequency masked channel modeling (SF-MCM), (ii) domain-transformation invariance (DTI), and (iii) position-invariant contrastive learning (PICL). These objectives jointly capture the underlying semantics of wireless channel from multiple perspectives. We further design lightweight decoders for key downstream tasks, including time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation, angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation, single base station (BS) localization, and multiple BS localization. Comprehensive experimental results confirm that LWLM consistently surpasses both model-based and supervised learning baselines across all localization tasks. In particular, LWLM achieves 26.0%--87.5% improvement over transformer models without pretraining, and exhibits strong generalization under label-limited fine-tuning and unseen BS configurations, confirming its potential as a foundation model for wireless localization.",

    "summary": "The emergence of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (HQML) models opens new horizons of computational intelligence but their fundamental complexity frequently leads to black box behavior that undermines transparency and reliability in their application. Although XAI for quantum systems still in its infancy, a major research gap is evident in robust global and local explainability approaches that are designed for HQML architectures that employ quantized feature encoding followed by classical learning. The gap is the focus of this work, which introduces QuXAI, an framework based upon Q-MEDLEY, an explainer for explaining feature importance in these hybrid systems. Our model entails the creation of HQML models incorporating quantum feature maps, the use of Q-MEDLEY, which combines feature based inferences, preserving the quantum transformation stage and visualizing the resulting attributions. Our result shows that Q-MEDLEY delineates influential classical aspects in HQML models, as well as separates their noise, and competes well against established XAI techniques in classical validation settings. Ablation studies more significantly expose the virtues of the composite structure used in Q-MEDLEY. The implications of this work are critically important, as it provides a route to improve the interpretability and reliability of HQML models, thus promoting greater confidence and being able to engage in safer and more responsible use of quantum-enhanced AI technology.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in image-based saliency prediction are approaching gold standard performance levels on existing benchmarks. Despite this success, we show that predicting fixations across multiple saliency datasets remains challenging due to dataset bias. We find a significant performance drop (around 40%) when models trained on one dataset are applied to another. Surprisingly, increasing dataset diversity does not resolve this inter-dataset gap, with close to 60% attributed to dataset-specific biases. To address this remaining generalization gap, we propose a novel architecture extending a mostly dataset-agnostic encoder-decoder structure with fewer than 20 dataset-specific parameters that govern interpretable mechanisms such as multi-scale structure, center bias, and fixation spread. Adapting only these parameters to new data accounts for more than 75% of the generalization gap, with a large fraction of the improvement achieved with as few as 50 samples. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art on all three datasets of the MIT/Tuebingen Saliency Benchmark (MIT300, CAT2000, and COCO-Freeview), even when purely generalizing from unrelated datasets, but with a substantial boost when adapting to the respective training datasets. The model also provides valuable insights into spatial saliency properties, revealing complex multi-scale effects that combine both absolute and relative sizes.",

    "summary": "Rapid expansion of model size has emerged as a key challenge in time series forecasting. From early Transformer with tens of megabytes to recent architectures like TimesNet with thousands of megabytes, performance gains have often come at the cost of exponentially increasing parameter counts. But is this scaling truly necessary? To question the applicability of the scaling law in time series forecasting, we propose Alinear, an ultra-lightweight forecasting model that achieves competitive performance using only k-level parameters. We introduce a horizon-aware adaptive decomposition mechanism that dynamically rebalances component emphasis across different forecast lengths, alongside a progressive frequency attenuation strategy that achieves stable prediction in various forecasting horizons without incurring the computational overhead of attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that Alinear consistently outperforms large-scale models while using less than 1% of their parameters, maintaining strong accuracy across both short and ultra-long forecasting horizons. Moreover, to more fairly evaluate model efficiency, we propose a new parameter-aware evaluation metric that highlights the superiority of ALinear under constrained model budgets. Our analysis reveals that the relative importance of trend and seasonal components varies depending on data characteristics rather than following a fixed pattern, validating the necessity of our adaptive design. This work challenges the prevailing belief that larger models are inherently better and suggests a paradigm shift toward more efficient time series modeling.",

    "summary": "Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, such as autonomous robots and intelligent vehicles, are increasingly reliant on diverse heterogeneous accelerators (e.g., GPGPUs, NPUs, FPGAs) to meet stringent real-time processing and energy-efficiency demands. However, the proliferation of vendor-specific proprietary communication libraries creates significant interoperability barriers, hindering seamless collaboration between different accelerator types and leading to suboptimal resource utilization and performance bottlenecks in distributed AI workloads. This paper introduces KAITIAN, a novel distributed communication framework designed to bridge this gap. KAITIAN provides a unified abstraction layer that intelligently integrates vendor-optimized communication libraries for intra-group efficiency with general-purpose communication protocols for inter-group interoperability. Crucially, it incorporates a load-adaptive scheduling mechanism that dynamically balances computational tasks across heterogeneous devices based on their real-time performance characteristics. Implemented as an extension to PyTorch and rigorously evaluated on a testbed featuring NVIDIA GPUs and Cambricon MLUs, KAITIAN demonstrates significant improvements in resource utilization and scalability for distributed training tasks. Experimental results show that KAITIAN can accelerate training time by up to 42% compared to baseline homogeneous systems, while incurring minimal communication overhead (2.8--4.3%) and maintaining model accuracy. KAITIAN paves the way for more flexible and powerful heterogeneous computing in complex embodied AI applications.",

While some prior works have attempted to categorize CoTs using predefined strategy types, such approaches are constrained by human intuition and fail to capture the full diversity of model behaviors. In this work, we introduce the CoT Encyclopedia, a bottom-up framework for analyzing and steering model reasoning. Our method automatically extracts diverse reasoning criteria from model-generated CoTs, embeds them into a semantic space, clusters them into representative categories, and derives contrastive rubrics to interpret reasoning behavior. Human evaluations show that this framework produces more interpretable and comprehensive analyses than existing methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that this understanding enables performance gains: we can predict which strategy a model is likely to use and guide it toward more effective alternatives. Finally, we provide practical insights, such as that training data format (e.g., free-form vs. multiple-choice) has a far greater impact on reasoning behavior than data domain, underscoring the importance of format-aware model design.",

    "summary": "Mesoscale eddies dominate the spatiotemporal multiscale variability of the ocean, and their impact on the energy cascade of the global ocean cannot be ignored. Eddy-resolving ocean forecasting is providing more reliable protection for fisheries and navigational safety, but also presents significant scientific challenges and high computational costs for traditional numerical models. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather and ocean forecasting systems are becoming powerful tools that balance forecast performance with computational efficiency. However, the complex multiscale features in the ocean dynamical system make AI models still face many challenges in mesoscale eddy forecasting (especially regional modelling). Here, we develop LanTu, a regional eddy-resolving ocean forecasting system based on dynamics-enhanced deep learning. We incorporate cross-scale interactions into LanTu and construct multiscale physical constraint for optimising LanTu guided by knowledge of eddy dynamics in order to improve the forecasting skill of LanTu for mesoscale evolution. The results show that LanTu outperforms the existing advanced operational numerical ocean forecasting system (NOFS) and AI-based ocean forecasting system (AI-OFS) in temperature, salinity, sea level anomaly and current prediction, with a lead time of more than 10 days. Our study highlights that dynamics-enhanced deep learning (LanTu) can be a powerful paradigm for eddy-resolving ocean forecasting.",

    "summary": "Community detection, a vital technology for real-world applications, uncovers cohesive node groups (communities) by leveraging both topological and attribute similarities in social networks. However, existing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) trained to maximize modularity often converge to suboptimal solutions. Additionally, directly using human-labeled communities for training can undermine topological cohesiveness by grouping disconnected nodes based solely on node attributes. We address these issues by proposing a novel Topological and Attributive Similarity-based Community detection (TAS-Com) method. TAS-Com introduces a novel loss function that exploits the highly effective and scalable Leiden algorithm to detect community structures with global optimal modularity. Leiden is further utilized to refine human-labeled communities to ensure connectivity within each community, enabling TAS-Com to detect community structures with desirable trade-offs between modularity and compliance with human labels. Experimental results on multiple benchmark networks confirm that TAS-Com can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art algorithms.",

However, for non-monotonic reasoning, e.g., abductive reasoning, comparably little is known outside classic complexity theory. In this paper we take a first step of bridging the gap between monotonic and non-monotonic reasoning by analyzing the complexity of intractable abduction problems under the seemingly overlooked but natural parameter n: the number of variables in the knowledge base. We obtain several positive results for $\\Sigma^P_2$- as well as NP- and coNP-complete fragments, which implies the first example of beating exhaustive search for a $\\Sigma^P_2$-complete problem (to the best of our knowledge). We complement this with lower bounds and for many fragments rule out improvements under the (strong) exponential-time hypothesis.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to recommendation scenarios due to their remarkable natural language understanding and generation capabilities. Although significant research has explored the use of LLMs for various recommendation tasks, little effort has been dedicated to verifying whether they have memorized public recommendation dataset as part of their training data. This is undesirable because memorization reduces the generalizability of research findings, as benchmarking on memorized datasets does not guarantee generalization to unseen datasets. Furthermore, memorization can amplify biases, for example, some popular items may be recommended more frequently than others.\nIn this work, we investigate whether LLMs have memorized public recommendation datasets. Specifically, we examine two model families (GPT and Llama) across multiple sizes, focusing on one of the most widely used dataset in recommender systems: MovieLens-1M. First, we define dataset memorization as the extent to which item attributes, user profiles, and user-item interactions can be retrieved by prompting the LLMs. Second, we analyze the impact of memorization on recommendation performance. Lastly, we examine whether memorization varies across model families and model sizes. Our results reveal that all models exhibit some degree of memorization of MovieLens-1M, and that recommendation performance is related to the extent of memorization.

Specifically, the focus is on the binary classification task of identifying references to human rights violations within the dataset.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of these models, their annotations are compared against a gold standard set of human double-annotated labels across 1000 samples. The analysis includes assessing annotation performance under different prompting conditions, with prompts provided in both English and Russian. Additionally, the study explores the unique patterns of errors and disagreements exhibited by each model, offering insights into their strengths, limitations, and cross-linguistic adaptability.\nBy juxtaposing LLM outputs with human annotations, this research contributes to understanding the reliability and applicability of LLMs for sensitive, domain-specific tasks in multilingual contexts. It also sheds light on how language models handle inherently subjective and context-dependent judgments, a critical consideration for their deployment in real-world scenarios.",

Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed critical vulnerabilities in FL, showing that a malicious central server can manipulate model updates to reconstruct clients' private training data. Existing data reconstruction attacks have important limitations: they often rely on assumptions about the clients' data distribution or their efficiency significantly degrades when batch sizes exceed just a few tens of samples.\nIn this work, we introduce a novel data reconstruction attack that overcomes these limitations. Our method leverages a new geometric perspective on fully connected layers to craft malicious model parameters, enabling the perfect recovery of arbitrarily large data batches in classification tasks without any prior knowledge of clients' data. Through extensive experiments on both image and tabular datasets, we demonstrate that our attack outperforms existing methods and achieves perfect reconstruction of data batches two orders of magnitude larger than the state of the art.",

    "summary": "Vehicle platooning, with vehicles traveling in close formation coordinated through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, offers significant benefits in fuel efficiency and road utilization. However, it is vulnerable to sophisticated falsification attacks by authenticated insiders that can destabilize the formation and potentially cause catastrophic collisions. This paper addresses this challenge: misbehavior detection in vehicle platooning systems. We present AttentionGuard, a transformer-based framework for misbehavior detection that leverages the self-attention mechanism to identify anomalous patterns in mobility data. Our proposal employs a multi-head transformer-encoder to process sequential kinematic information, enabling effective differentiation between normal mobility patterns and falsification attacks across diverse platooning scenarios, including steady-state (no-maneuver) operation, join, and exit maneuvers. Our evaluation uses an extensive simulation dataset featuring various attack vectors (constant, gradual, and combined falsifications) and operational parameters (controller types, vehicle speeds, and attacker positions). Experimental results demonstrate that AttentionGuard achieves up to 0.95 F1-score in attack detection, with robust performance maintained during complex maneuvers. Notably, our system performs effectively with minimal latency (100ms decision intervals), making it suitable for real-time transportation safety applications. Comparative analysis reveals superior detection capabilities and establishes the transformer-encoder as a promising approach for securing Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) against sophisticated insider threats.",

    "summary": "Federated learning (FL) enhances privacy and reduces communication cost for resource-constrained edge clients by supporting distributed model training at the edge. However, the heterogeneous nature of such devices produces diverse, non-independent, and identically distributed (non-IID) data, making the detection of backdoor attacks more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel federated representative-attention-based defense mechanism, named FeRA, that leverages cross-client attention over internal feature representations to distinguish benign from malicious clients. FeRA computes an anomaly score based on representation reconstruction errors, effectively identifying clients whose internal activations significantly deviate from the group consensus. Our evaluation demonstrates FeRA's robustness across various FL scenarios, including challenging non-IID data distributions typical of edge devices. Experimental results show that it effectively reduces backdoor attack success rates while maintaining high accuracy on the main task. The method is model-agnostic, attack-agnostic, and does not require labeled reference data, making it well suited to heterogeneous and resource-limited edge deployments.",

    "summary": "Responsible AI (RAI) efforts increasingly emphasize the importance of addressing potential harms early in the AI development lifecycle through social-technical lenses. However, in cross-functional industry teams, this work is often stalled by a persistent knowledge handoff challenge: the difficulty of transferring high-level, early-stage technical design rationales from technical experts to non-technical or user-facing roles for ethical evaluation and harm identification. Through literature review and a co-design study with 8 practitioners, we unpack how this challenge manifests -- technical design choices are rarely handed off in ways that support meaningful engagement by non-technical roles; collaborative workflows lack shared, visual structures to support mutual understanding; and non-technical practitioners are left without scaffolds for systematic harm evaluation. Existing tools like JIRA or Google Docs, while useful for product tracking, are ill-suited for supporting joint harm identification across roles, often requiring significant extra effort to align understanding. To address this, we developed AI LEGO, a web-based prototype that supports cross-functional AI practitioners in effectively facilitating knowledge handoff and identifying harmful design choices in the early design stages. Technical roles use interactive blocks to draft development plans, while non-technical roles engage with those blocks through stage-specific checklists and LLM-driven persona simulations to surface potential harms. In a study with 18 cross-functional practitioners, AI LEGO increased the volume and likelihood of harms identified compared to baseline worksheets. Participants found that its modular structure and persona prompts made harm identification more accessible, fostering clearer and more collaborative RAI practices in early design.",

In particular, our approach outperforms all other existing 8B or 70B models when trained at those sizes, including models distilled from DeepSeek-R1.

We provide analysis and ablations comparing Pairwise-J1 vs Pointwise-J1 models, offline vs online training recipes, reward strategies, seed prompts, and variations in thought length and content. We find that our models make better judgments by learning to outline evaluation criteria, comparing against self-generated reference answers, and re-evaluating the correctness of model responses.",

While deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown an impressive ability to learn optimal policies in stationary environments, most methods are data intensive and assume a world that does not change between training and test time. As a result, conventional RL methods struggle to adapt when conditions change. This poses a fundamental challenge: how can RL agents efficiently adapt their behavior when encountering novel environmental changes during deployment without catastrophically forgetting useful prior knowledge? This dissertation demonstrates that efficient online adaptation requires two key capabilities: (1) prioritized exploration and sampling strategies that help identify and learn from relevant experiences, and (2) selective preservation of prior knowledge through structured representations that can be updated without disruption to reusable components.",

    "summary": "Randomness is ubiquitous in many applications across data science and machine learning. Remarkably, systems composed of random components often display emergent global behaviors that appear deterministic, manifesting a transition from microscopic disorder to macroscopic organization. In this work, we introduce a theoretical model for studying the emergence of collective behaviors in ensembles of random classifiers. We argue that, if the ensemble is weighted through the Gibbs measure defined by adopting the classification loss as an energy, then there exists a finite temperature parameter for the distribution such that the classification is optimal, with respect to the loss (or the energy). Interestingly, for the case in which samples are generated by a Gaussian distribution and labels are constructed by employing a teacher perceptron, we analytically prove and numerically confirm that such optimal temperature does not depend neither on the teacher classifier (which is, by construction of the learning problem, unknown), nor on the number of random classifiers, highlighting the universal nature of the observed behavior. Experiments on the MNIST dataset underline the relevance of this phenomenon in high-quality, noiseless, datasets. Finally, a physical analogy allows us to shed light on the self-organizing nature of the studied phenomenon.",

    "summary": "Specialized Multi-Task Optimizers (SMTOs) balance task learning in Multi-Task Learning by addressing issues like conflicting gradients and differing gradient norms, which hinder equal-weighted task training. However, recent critiques suggest that equally weighted tasks can achieve competitive results compared to SMTOs, arguing that previous SMTO results were influenced by poor hyperparameter optimization and lack of regularization. In this work, we evaluate these claims through an extensive empirical evaluation of SMTOs, including some of the latest methods, on more complex multi-task problems to clarify this behavior. Our findings indicate that SMTOs perform well compared to uniform loss and that fixed weights can achieve competitive performance compared to SMTOs. Furthermore, we demonstrate why uniform loss perform similarly to SMTOs in some instances. The code will be made publicly available.",

    "summary": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown competitive performance to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in various vision tasks, while offering superior energy efficiency. However, existing SNN-based Transformers primarily focus on single-image tasks, emphasizing spatial features while not effectively leveraging SNNs' efficiency in video-based vision tasks. In this paper, we introduce SpikeVideoFormer, an efficient spike-driven video Transformer, featuring linear temporal complexity $\\mathcal{O}(T)$. Specifically, we design a spike-driven Hamming attention (SDHA) which provides a theoretically guided adaptation from traditional real-valued attention to spike-driven attention. Building on SDHA, we further analyze various spike-driven space-time attention designs and identify an optimal scheme that delivers appealing performance for video tasks, while maintaining only linear temporal complexity. The generalization ability and efficiency of our model are demonstrated across diverse downstream video tasks, including classification, human pose tracking, and semantic segmentation. Empirical results show our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing SNN approaches, with over 15\\% improvement on the latter two tasks. Additionally, it matches the performance of recent ANN-based methods while offering significant efficiency gains, achieving $\\times 16$, $\\times 10$ and $\\times 5$ improvements on the three tasks. this https URL",

However, these AI scribes still rely on one-shot, or few-shot prompts for generating notes after the consultation has ended, employing little to no reasoning. This risks long notes with an increase in hallucinations, misrepresentation of the intent of the clinician, and reliance on the proofreading of the clinician to catch errors. A dangerous combination for patient safety if vigilance is compromised by workload and fatigue. In this paper, we introduce a method for extracting salient clinical information in real-time alongside the healthcare consultation, denoted Facts, and use that information recursively to generate the final note.

    "summary": "The Spiking Neural Network (SNN) has drawn increasing attention for its energy-efficient, event-driven processing and biological plausibility. To train SNNs via backpropagation, surrogate gradients are used to approximate the non-differentiable spike function, but they only maintain nonzero derivatives within a narrow range of membrane potentials near the firing threshold, referred to as the surrogate gradient support width gamma. We identify a major challenge, termed the dilemma of gamma: a relatively large gamma leads to overactivation, characterized by excessive neuron firing, which in turn increases energy consumption, whereas a small gamma causes vanishing gradients and weakens temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose a temporal Inhibitory Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ILIF) neuron model, inspired by biological inhibitory mechanisms. This model incorporates interconnected inhibitory units for membrane potential and current, effectively mitigating overactivation while preserving gradient propagation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates ILIF effectiveness in overcoming the gamma dilemma, and extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that ILIF improves energy efficiency by reducing firing rates, stabilizes training, and enhances accuracy.

    "summary": "Software vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and SQL injections are a major source of security breaches. Traditional methods for vulnerability detection remain essential but are limited by high false positive rates, scalability issues, and reliance on manual effort. These constraints have driven interest in AI-based approaches to automated vulnerability detection and secure code generation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for classification tasks, their complexity and opacity pose challenges for interpretability and deployment. Sparse Autoencoder offer a promising solution to this problem. We explore whether SAEs can serve as a lightweight, interpretable alternative for bug detection in Java functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of SAEs when applied to representations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2B, examining their capacity to highlight buggy behaviour without fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. We found that SAE-derived features enable bug detection with an F1 score of up to 89%, consistently outperforming fine-tuned transformer encoder baselines. Our work provides the first empirical evidence that SAEs can be used to detect software bugs directly from the internal representations of pretrained LLMs, without any fine-tuning or task-specific supervision.",

    "summary": "The multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem asks to find a set of paths on a graph such that when synchronously following these paths the agents never encounter a conflict. In the most widespread MAPF formulation, the so-called Classical MAPF, the agents sizes are neglected and two types of conflicts are considered: occupying the same vertex or using the same edge at the same time step. Meanwhile in numerous practical applications, e.g. in robotics, taking into account the agents' sizes is vital to ensure that the MAPF solutions can be safely executed. Introducing large agents yields an additional type of conflict arising when one agent follows an edge and its body overlaps with the body of another agent that is actually not using this same edge (e.g. staying still at some distinct vertex of the graph). Until now it was not clear how harder the problem gets when such conflicts are to be considered while planning. Specifically, it was known that Classical MAPF problem on an undirected graph can be solved in polynomial time, however no complete polynomial-time algorithm was presented to solve MAPF with large agents. In this paper we, for the first time, establish that the latter problem is NP-hard and, thus, if P!=NP no polynomial algorithm for it can, unfortunately, be presented. Our proof is based on the prevalent in the field technique of reducing the seminal 3SAT problem (which is known to be an NP-complete problem) to the problem at hand. In particular, for an arbitrary 3SAT formula we procedurally construct a dedicated graph with specific start and goal vertices and show that the given 3SAT formula is satisfiable iff the corresponding path finding instance has a solution.",

    "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework for learning over graph-structured data, yet their expressive capacity is often hindered by over-squashing, wherein information from distant nodes is compressed into fixed-size vectors. Existing solutions, including graph rewiring and bottleneck-resistant architectures such as Cayley and expander graphs, avoid this problem but introduce scalability bottlenecks. In particular, the Cayley graphs constructed over $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z}_n)$ exhibit strong theoretical properties, yet suffer from cubic node growth $O(n^3)$, leading to high memory usage. To address this, this work introduces Schrier-Coset Graph Propagation (SCGP), a group-theoretic augmentation method that enriches node features through Schreier-coset embeddings without altering the input graph topology. SCGP embeds bottleneck-free connectivity patterns into a compact feature space, improving long-range message passing while maintaining computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations across standard node and graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that SCGP achieves performance comparable to, or exceeding, expander graph and rewired GNN baselines. Furthermore, SCGP exhibits particular advantages in processing hierarchical and modular graph structures, offering reduced inference latency, improved scalability, and a low memory footprint, making it suitable for real-time and resource-constrained applications.",

Focusing on the diluted Ising model, which lacks an exact analytical solution, we explore two complementary approaches: a supervised classification using simple dense neural networks, and an unsupervised detection of phase transitions using convolutional autoencoders trained solely on idealized spin configurations.\nTo enhance model performance, we incorporate two key forms of physics-informed guidance. First, we exploit architectural biases which preferentially amplify features related to symmetry breaking. Second, we include training configurations that explicitly break $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, reinforcing the network's ability to detect ordered phases. These mechanisms, acting in tandem, increase the network's sensitivity to phase structure even in the absence of explicit labels. We validate the machine learning predictions through comparison with direct numerical estimates of critical temperatures and percolation thresholds.\nOur results show that synthetic, structured, and computationally efficient training schemes can reveal physically meaningful phase boundaries, even in complex systems. This framework offers a low-cost and robust alternative to conventional methods, with potential applications in broader condensed matter and statistical physics contexts.",

    "summary": "With the advent of neural language models, the performance of code generation has been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions, thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the best-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of generated code.",

    "summary": "Generative semantic communication (Gen-SemCom) with large artificial intelligence (AI) model promises a transformative paradigm for 6G networks, which reduces communication costs by transmitting low-dimensional prompts rather than raw data. However, purely prompt-driven generation loses fine-grained visual details. Additionally, there is a lack of systematic metrics to evaluate the performance of Gen-SemCom systems. To address these issues, we develop a hybrid Gen-SemCom system with a critical information embedding (CIE) framework, where both text prompts and semantically critical features are extracted for transmissions. First, a novel approach of semantic filtering is proposed to select and transmit the semantically critical features of images relevant to semantic label. By integrating the text prompt and critical features, the receiver reconstructs high-fidelity images using a diffusion-based generative model. Next, we propose the generative visual information fidelity (GVIF) metric to evaluate the visual quality of the generated image. By characterizing the statistical models of image features, the GVIF metric quantifies the mutual information between the distorted features and their original counterparts. By maximizing the GVIF metric, we design a channel-adaptive Gen-SemCom system that adaptively control the volume of features and compression rate according to the channel state. Experimental results validate the GVIF metric's sensitivity to visual fidelity, correlating with both the PSNR and critical information volume. In addition, the optimized system achieves superior performance over benchmarking schemes in terms of higher PSNR and lower FID scores.",

Recent work highlights the potential of deep learning approaches and their ability to capture details with a quality increasingly close to that of professional cameras. A difficult and costly step when developing a learned ISP is the acquisition of pixel-wise aligned paired data that maps the raw captured by a smartphone camera sensor to high-quality reference images. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a novel training method for a learnable ISP that eliminates the need for direct correspondences between raw images and ground-truth data with matching content. Our unpaired approach employs a multi-term loss function guided by adversarial training with multiple discriminators processing feature maps from pre-trained networks to maintain content structure while learning color and texture characteristics from the target RGB dataset. Using lightweight neural network architectures suitable for mobile devices as backbones, we evaluated our method on the Zurich RAW to RGB and Fujifilm UltraISP datasets. Compared to paired training methods, our unpaired learning strategy shows strong potential and achieves high fidelity across multiple evaluation metrics.

    "summary": "Imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) each offer distinct advantages for robotics policy learning: IL provides stable learning from demonstrations, and RL promotes generalization through exploration. While existing robot learning approaches using IL-based pre-training followed by RL-based fine-tuning are promising, this two-step learning paradigm often suffers from instability and poor sample efficiency during the RL fine-tuning phase. In this work, we introduce IN-RIL, INterleaved Reinforcement learning and Imitation Learning, for policy fine-tuning, which periodically injects IL updates after multiple RL updates and hence can benefit from the stability of IL and the guidance of expert data for more efficient exploration throughout the entire fine-tuning process. Since IL and RL involve different optimization objectives, we develop gradient separation mechanisms to prevent destructive interference during \\ABBR fine-tuning, by separating possibly conflicting gradient updates in orthogonal subspaces. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous analysis, and our findings shed light on why interleaving IL with RL stabilizes learning and improves sample-efficiency. Extensive experiments on 14 robot manipulation and locomotion tasks across 3 benchmarks, including FurnitureBench, OpenAI Gym, and Robomimic, demonstrate that \\ABBR can significantly improve sample efficiency and mitigate performance collapse during online finetuning in both long- and short-horizon tasks with either sparse or dense rewards. IN-RIL, as a general plug-in compatible with various state-of-the-art RL algorithms, can significantly improve RL fine-tuning, e.g., from 12\\% to 88\\% with 6.3x improvement in the success rate on Robomimic Transport.

    "summary": "Understanding the reasoning and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for their reliable use in programming tasks. While recent studies have assessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the accuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them. Moreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar issues in code understanding.\nIn this work, we evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B parameters can reason about Python programs or are simply guessing. We apply five semantics-preserving code mutations: renaming variables, mirroring comparison expressions, swapping if-else branches, converting for loops to while, and loop unrolling. These mutations maintain program semantics while altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and performed a human expert analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the correct predictions are based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction stability across different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our findings show that some LLMs, such as Llama3.2, produce correct predictions based on flawed reasoning in up to 61% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change predictions in response to our code mutations, indicating limited robustness in their semantic understanding.",

They are capable of performing complex semantic tasks such as automatic captioning, but it remains an open question about how well they comprehend the visuospatial properties of scenes depicted in the images they process. We argue that descriptions of virtual objects -- objects that are not visually represented in an image -- can help test scene comprehension in these AI systems. For example, an image that depicts a person standing under a tree can be paired with the following prompt: imagine that a kite is stuck in the tree. VLMs that comprehend the scene should update their representations and reason sensibly about the spatial relations between all three objects. We describe systematic evaluations of state-of-the-art VLMs and show that their ability to process virtual objects is inadequate.",

    "summary": "Incremental learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model learns from a sequential stream of tasks. This setting poses a key challenge: balancing plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (preserving past knowledge). Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a branch of AutoML, automates the design of the architecture of Deep Neural Networks and has shown success in static settings. However, existing NAS-based approaches to incremental learning often rely on expanding the model at every task, making them impractical in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we introduce SEAL, a NAS-based framework tailored for data-incremental learning, a scenario where disjoint data samples arrive sequentially and are not stored for future access. SEAL adapts the model structure dynamically by expanding it only when necessary, based on a capacity estimation metric. Stability is preserved through cross-distillation training after each expansion step. The NAS component jointly searches for both the architecture and the optimal expansion policy. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SEAL effectively reduces forgetting and enhances accuracy while maintaining a lower model size compared to prior methods. These results highlight the promise of combining NAS and selective expansion for efficient, adaptive learning in incremental scenarios.",

    "summary": "The success of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on the observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this neural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model size -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs represent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e., representations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur with varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss scaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only the most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of loss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature frequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong superposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other, the loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide range of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is explained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower dimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales inversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced LLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match the predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also agree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an important mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws. We anticipate that these insights will inspire new training strategies and model architectures to achieve better performance with less computation and fewer parameters.",

    "summary": "Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.",

However, there is a lack of a unified evaluation framework for these models, which would enable an elegant, simplified, and overall evaluation. Current models conduct evaluations on multiple task-specific benchmarks, but there are significant limitations, such as the lack of overall results, errors from extra evaluation models, reliance on extensive labeled images, benchmarks that lack diversity, and metrics with limited capacity for instruction-following evaluation. To tackle these challenges, we introduce UniEval, the first evaluation framework designed for unified multimodal models without extra models, images, or annotations. This facilitates a simplified and unified evaluation process. The UniEval framework contains a holistic benchmark, UniBench (supports both unified and visual generation models), along with the corresponding UniScore metric. UniBench includes 81 fine-grained tags contributing to high diversity. Experimental results indicate that UniBench is more challenging than existing benchmarks, and UniScore aligns closely with human evaluations, surpassing current metrics. Moreover, we extensively evaluated SoTA unified and visual generation models, uncovering new insights into Univeral's unique values.",

However, these methods face challenges due to their specificity to certain neural network architectures and data modalities. Existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) frameworks have attempted to address these challenges but suffer from several limitations. These include limited flexibility to diverse model architectures and data modalities due to hard-coded implementations, a restricted number of supported XAI methods because of the requirements for layer-specific operations of attribution methods, and sub-optimal recommendations of explanations due to the lack of evaluation and optimization phases. Consequently, these limitations impede the adoption of XAI technology in real-world applications, making it difficult for practitioners to select the optimal explanation method for their domain. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{PnPXAI}, a universal XAI framework that supports diverse data modalities and neural network models in a Plug-and-Play (PnP) manner. PnPXAI automatically detects model architectures, recommends applicable explanation methods, and optimizes hyperparameters for optimal explanations.

Compared to existing methods, MuToR offers several key advantages: it introduces only a negligible number of additional parameters, requires no architectural changes--ensuring compatibility with off-the-shelf pretrained language models--and remains aligned with the next-token pretraining objective, making it especially well-suited for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover, it naturally supports scalable prediction horizons. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of MuToR across a range of use cases, including supervised fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and pretraining, on challenging generative tasks in both language and vision domains.

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in robotic manipulation but faces challenges in sample inefficiency and lack of interpretability, limiting its applicability in real world scenarios. Enabling the agent to gain a deeper understanding and adapt more efficiently to diverse working scenarios is crucial, and strategic knowledge utilization is a key factor in this process. This paper proposes a Knowledge Capture, Adaptation, and Composition (KCAC) framework to systematically integrate knowledge transfer into RL through cross-task curriculum learning. KCAC is evaluated using a two block stacking task in the CausalWorld benchmark, a complex robotic manipulation environment. To our knowledge, existing RL approaches fail to solve this task effectively, reflecting deficiencies in knowledge capture. In this work, we redesign the benchmark reward function by removing rigid constraints and strict ordering, allowing the agent to maximize total rewards concurrently and enabling flexible task completion. Furthermore, we define two self-designed sub-tasks and implement a structured cross-task curriculum to facilitate efficient learning. As a result, our KCAC approach achieves a 40 percent reduction in training time while improving task success rates by 10 percent compared to traditional RL methods. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key curriculum design parameters subtask selection, transition timing, and learning rate that optimize learning efficiency and provide conceptual guidance for curriculum based RL frameworks. This work offers valuable insights into curriculum design in RL and robotic learning.",

    "summary": "The O-RAN architecture is transforming cellular networks by adopting RAN softwarization and disaggregation concepts to enable data-driven monitoring and control of the network. Such management is enabled by RICs, which facilitate near-real-time and non-real-time network control through xApps and rApps. However, they face limitations, including latency overhead in data exchange between the RAN and RIC, restricting real-time monitoring, and the inability to access user plain data due to privacy and security constraints, hindering use cases like beamforming and spectrum classification. In this paper, we leverage the dApps concept to enable real-time RF spectrum classification with LibIQ, a novel library for RF signals that facilitates efficient spectrum monitoring and signal classification by providing functionalities to read I/Q samples as time-series, create datasets and visualize time-series data through plots and spectrograms. Thanks to LibIQ, I/Q samples can be efficiently processed to detect external RF signals, which are subsequently classified using a CNN inside the library. To achieve accurate spectrum analysis, we created an extensive dataset of time-series-based I/Q samples, representing distinct signal types captured using a custom dApp running on a 5G deployment over the Colosseum network emulator and an OTA testbed. We evaluate our model by deploying LibIQ in heterogeneous scenarios with varying center frequencies, time windows, and external RF signals. In real-time analysis, the model classifies the processed I/Q samples, achieving an average accuracy of approximately 97.8\\% in identifying signal types across all scenarios. We pledge to release both LibIQ and the dataset created as a publicly available framework upon acceptance.",

    "summary": "Foundation models can provide robust high-level reasoning on appropriate safety interventions in hazardous scenarios beyond a robot's training data, i.e. out-of-distribution (OOD) failures. However, due to the high inference latency of Large Vision and Language Models, current methods rely on manually defined intervention policies to enact fallbacks, thereby lacking the ability to plan generalizable, semantically safe motions. To overcome these challenges we present FORTRESS, a framework that generates and reasons about semantically safe fallback strategies in real time to prevent OOD failures. At a low frequency in nominal operations, FORTRESS uses multi-modal reasoners to identify goals and anticipate failure modes. When a runtime monitor triggers a fallback response, FORTRESS rapidly synthesizes plans to fallback goals while inferring and avoiding semantically unsafe regions in real time. By bridging open-world, multi-modal reasoning with dynamics-aware planning, we eliminate the need for hard-coded fallbacks and human safety interventions. FORTRESS outperforms on-the-fly prompting of slow reasoning models in safety classification accuracy on synthetic benchmarks and real-world ANYmal robot data, and further improves system safety and planning success in simulation and on quadrotor hardware for urban navigation.",

    "summary": "With the development of photorealistic diffusion models, models trained in part or fully on synthetic data achieve progressively better results. However, diffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in reality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture artifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a synthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic images containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered infeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered out-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a model's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be excluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility really matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is necessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers, focusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We introduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to include feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated by a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally affects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference in top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets. Also, the attribute matters on whether the feasible/infeasible images adversarially influence the classification performance. Finally, mixing feasible and infeasible images in training datasets does not significantly impact performance compared to using purely feasible or infeasible datasets.",

    "summary": "Natural language image-caption datasets, widely used for training Large Multimodal Models, mainly focus on natural scenarios and overlook the intricate details of mathematical figures that are critical for problem-solving, hindering the advancement of current LMMs in multimodal mathematical reasoning. To this end, we propose leveraging code as supervision for cross-modal alignment, since code inherently encodes all information needed to generate corresponding figures, establishing a precise connection between the two modalities. Specifically, we co-develop our image-to-code model and dataset with model-in-the-loop approach, resulting in an image-to-code model, FigCodifier and ImgCode-8.6M dataset, the largest image-code dataset to date. Furthermore, we utilize FigCodifier to synthesize novel mathematical figures and then construct MM-MathInstruct-3M, a high-quality multimodal math instruction fine-tuning dataset. Finally, we present MathCoder-VL, trained with ImgCode-8.6M for cross-modal alignment and subsequently fine-tuned on MM-MathInstruct-3M for multimodal math problem solving. Our model achieves a new open-source SOTA across all six metrics. Notably, it surpasses GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the geometry problem-solving subset of MathVista, achieving improvements of 8.9% and 9.2%. The dataset and models will be released at this https URL.",

We introduce Neural Thermodynamic Laws (NTL) -- a new framework that offers fresh insights into LLM training dynamics.

On the practical side, this scientific perspective yields intuitive guidelines for designing learning rate schedules.",

    "summary": "The number of agents can be an effective curriculum variable for controlling the difficulty of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks. Existing work typically uses manually defined curricula such as linear schemes. We identify two potential flaws while applying existing reward-based automatic curriculum learning methods in MARL: (1) The expected episode return used to measure task difficulty has high variance; (2) Credit assignment difficulty can be exacerbated in tasks where increasing the number of agents yields higher returns which is common in many MARL tasks. To address these issues, we propose to control the curriculum by using a TD-error based *learning progress* measure and by letting the curriculum proceed from an initial context distribution to the final task specific one. Since our approach maintains a distribution over the number of agents and measures learning progress rather than absolute performance, which often increases with the number of agents, we alleviate problem (2). Moreover, the learning progress measure naturally alleviates problem (1) by aggregating returns. In three challenging sparse-reward MARL benchmarks, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

With the right tools, these agents could learn to solve tasks in new environments by accumulating and updating their knowledge. Current LLM-based agents process past experiences using a full history of observations, summarization, retrieval augmentation. However, these unstructured memory representations do not facilitate the reasoning and planning essential for complex decision-making. In our study, we introduce AriGraph, a novel method wherein the agent constructs and updates a memory graph that integrates semantic and episodic memories while exploring the environment. We demonstrate that our Ariadne LLM agent, consisting of the proposed memory architecture augmented with planning and decision-making, effectively handles complex tasks within interactive text game environments difficult even for human players. Results show that our approach markedly outperforms other established memory methods and strong RL baselines in a range of problems of varying complexity. Additionally, AriGraph demonstrates competitive performance compared to dedicated knowledge graph-based methods in static multi-hop question-answering.",

This study categorizes such misalignments into three types: \\textbf{(1) Lack of functions to express intent}, \\textbf{(2) Inefficient action sequences}, and \\textbf{(3) Incorrect intentions that cannot solve the task}. To address these issues, we first formalize and define these three types of misalignments. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to detect these misalignments in O2ARC trajectories and conduct a hierarchical and quantitative analysis of their impact. Furthermore, we introduce an intention estimation algorithm that predicts missing alignment information between user actions and inferred intentions, leveraging our formalized framework. Through trajectory alignment, we experimentally demonstrate that AI models trained on human task-solving trajectories improve performance in mimicking human reasoning. Based on hierarchical analysis and experiments, we highlight the importance of trajectory-intention alignment and demonstrate the potential of intention learning.",

These visualizations not only aid in understanding existing knowledge spaces but also implicitly guide exploration into unknown areas. Although techniques such as t-SNE and UMAP can generate these maps, there exists no systematic method for leveraging them to generate new content. To address this, we introduce MapExplorer, a novel knowledge discovery task that translates coordinates within any projection map into coherent, contextually aligned textual content. This allows users to interactively explore and uncover insights embedded in the maps. To evaluate the performance of MapExplorer methods, we propose Atometric, a fine-grained metric inspired by ROUGE that quantifies logical coherence and alignment between generated and reference text. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the versatility of MapExplorer in generating scientific hypotheses, crafting synthetic personas, and devising strategies for attacking large language models-even with simple baseline methods. By bridging visualization and generation, our work highlights the potential of MapExplorer to enable intuitive human-AI collaboration in large-scale data exploration.",

    "summary": "Natural language interaction with sensing systems is crucial for addressing users' personal concerns and providing health-related insights into their daily lives. When a user asks a question, the system automatically analyzes the full history of sensor data, extracts relevant information, and generates an appropriate response. However, existing systems are limited to short-duration (e.g., one minute) or low-frequency (e.g., daily step count) sensor data. In addition, they struggle with quantitative questions that require precise numerical answers. In this work, we introduce SensorChat, the first end-to-end QA system designed for daily life monitoring using long-duration, high-frequency time series data. Given raw sensor signals spanning multiple days and a user-defined natural language question, SensorChat generates semantically meaningful responses that directly address user concerns. SensorChat effectively handles both quantitative questions that require numerical precision and qualitative questions that require high-level reasoning to infer subjective insights. To achieve this, SensorChat uses an innovative three-stage pipeline including question decomposition, sensor data query, and answer assembly. The first and third stages leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret human queries and generate responses. The intermediate querying stage extracts relevant information from the complete sensor data history. Real-world implementation demonstrate SensorChat's capability for real-time interactions on a cloud server while also being able to run entirely on edge platforms after quantization. Comprehensive QA evaluations show that SensorChat achieves up to 93% higher answer accuracy than state-of-the-art systems on quantitative questions. Additionally, a user study with eight volunteers highlights SensorChat's effectiveness in answering qualitative and open-ended questions.",

    "summary": "Generating SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) from natural language specifications remains a major challenge in formal verification (FV) due to the inherent ambiguity and incompleteness of specifications. Existing LLM-based approaches, such as AssertLLM, focus on extracting information solely from specification documents, often failing to capture essential internal signal interactions and design details present in the RTL code, leading to incomplete or incorrect assertions. We propose a novel approach that constructs a Knowledge Graph (KG) from both specifications and RTL, using a hardware-specific schema with domain-specific entity and relation types. We create an initial KG from the specification and then systematically fuse it with information extracted from the RTL code, resulting in a unified, comprehensive KG. This combined representation enables a more thorough understanding of the design and allows for a multi-resolution context synthesis process which is designed to extract diverse verification contexts from the KG. Experiments on four designs demonstrate that our method significantly enhances SVA quality over prior methods. This structured representation not only improves FV but also paves the way for future research in tasks like code generation and design understanding.",

    "summary": "The AI alignment problem, which focusses on ensuring that artificial intelligence (AI), including AGI and ASI, systems act according to human values, presents profound challenges. With the progression from narrow AI to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligence, fears about control and existential risk have escalated. Here, we investigate whether embracing inevitable AI misalignment can be a contingent strategy to foster a dynamic ecosystem of competing agents as a viable path to steer them in more human-aligned trends and mitigate risks. We explore how misalignment may serve and should be promoted as a counterbalancing mechanism to team up with whichever agents are most aligned to human interests, ensuring that no single system dominates destructively. The main premise of our contribution is that misalignment is inevitable because full AI-human alignment is a mathematical impossibility from Turing-complete systems, which we also offer as a proof in this contribution, a feature then inherited to AGI and ASI systems. We introduce a change-of-opinion attack test based on perturbation and intervention analysis to study how humans and agents may change or neutralise friendly and unfriendly AIs through cooperation and competition. We show that open models are more diverse and that most likely guardrails implemented in proprietary models are successful at controlling some of the agents' range of behaviour with positive and negative consequences while closed systems are more steerable and can also be used against proprietary AI systems. We also show that human and AI intervention has different effects hence suggesting multiple strategies.",

    "summary": "This research focuses on how Large Language Models (LLMs) can help with (path) planning for mobile embodied agents such as robots, in a human-in-the-loop and interactive manner. A novel framework named LLM A*, aims to leverage the commonsense of LLMs, and the utility-optimal A* is proposed to facilitate few-shot near-optimal path planning. Prompts are used for two main purposes: 1) to provide LLMs with essential information like environments, costs, heuristics, etc.; 2) to communicate human feedback on intermediate planning results to LLMs. This approach takes human feedback on board and renders the entire planning process transparent (akin to a `white box') to humans. Moreover, it facilitates code-free path planning, thereby fostering the accessibility and inclusiveness of artificial intelligence techniques to communities less proficient in coding. Comparative analysis against A* and RL demonstrates that LLM A* exhibits greater efficiency in terms of search space and achieves paths comparable to A* while outperforming RL. The interactive nature of LLM A* also makes it a promising tool for deployment in collaborative human-robot tasks. Codes and Supplemental Materials can be found at GitHub: this https URL.",

    "summary": "Although remarkable progress has been made in image style transfer, style is just one of the components of artistic paintings. Directly transferring extracted style features to natural images often results in outputs with obvious synthetic traces. This is because key painting attributes including layout, perspective, shape, and semantics often cannot be conveyed and expressed through style transfer. Large-scale pretrained text-to-image generation models have demonstrated their capability to synthesize a vast amount of high-quality images. However, even with extensive textual descriptions, it is challenging to fully express the unique visual properties and details of paintings. Moreover, generic models often disrupt the overall artistic effect when modifying specific areas, making it more complicated to achieve a unified aesthetic in artworks. Our main novel idea is to integrate multimodal semantic information as a synthesis guide into artworks, rather than transferring style to the real world. We also aim to reduce the disruption to the harmony of artworks while simplifying the guidance conditions. Specifically, we propose an innovative multi-task unified framework called CreativeSynth, based on the diffusion model with the ability to coordinate multimodal inputs. CreativeSynth combines multimodal features with customized attention mechanisms to seamlessly integrate real-world semantic content into the art domain through Cross-Art-Attention for aesthetic maintenance and semantic fusion. We demonstrate the results of our method across a wide range of different art categories, proving that CreativeSynth bridges the gap between generative models and artistic expression.

Addressing these challenges, the integration of artificial intelligence with materials science has opened avenues for accelerating the discovery process, though it also demands precise annotation, data extraction, and traceability of information. To tackle these issues, this article introduces the Materials Knowledge Graph (MKG), which utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques integrated with large language models to extract and systematically organize a decade's worth of high-quality research into structured triples, contains 162,605 nodes and 731,772 edges. MKG categorizes information into comprehensive labels such as Name, Formula, and Application, structured around a meticulously designed ontology, thus enhancing data usability and integration. By implementing network-based algorithms, MKG not only facilitates efficient link prediction but also significantly reduces reliance on traditional experimental methods. This structured approach not only streamlines materials research but also lays the groundwork for more sophisticated science knowledge graphs.",

As the volume and sophistication of cyber threats continue to grow, there is an increasing need for intelligent systems that can automatically detect vulnerabilities, analyze malware, and respond to attacks. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature on the application of LLMs in cybersecurity (LLM4Security). By comprehensively collecting over 30K relevant papers and systematically analyzing 127 papers from top security and software engineering venues, we aim to provide a holistic view of how LLMs are being used to solve diverse problems across the cybersecurity domain. Through our analysis, we identify several key findings. First, we observe that LLMs are being applied to a wide range of cybersecurity tasks, including vulnerability detection, malware analysis, network intrusion detection, and phishing detection. Second, we find that the datasets used for training and evaluating LLMs in these tasks are often limited in size and diversity, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and representative datasets. Third, we identify several promising techniques for adapting LLMs to specific cybersecurity domains, such as fine-tuning, transfer learning, and domain-specific pre-training. Finally, we discuss the main challenges and opportunities for future research in LLM4Security, including the need for more interpretable and explainable models, the importance of addressing data privacy and security concerns, and the potential for leveraging LLMs for proactive defense and threat hunting. Overall, our survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in LLM4Security and identifies several promising directions for future research.",

    "summary": "Searching through chemical space is an exceptionally challenging problem because the number of possible molecules grows combinatorially with the number of atoms. Large, autoregressive models trained on databases of chemical compounds have yielded powerful generators, but we still lack robust strategies for generating molecules with desired properties. This molecular search problem closely resembles the \"alignment\" problem for large language models, though for many chemical tasks we have a specific and easily evaluable reward function. Here, we introduce an algorithm called energy rank alignment (ERA) that leverages an explicit reward function to produce a gradient-based objective that we use to optimize autoregressive policies. We show theoretically that this algorithm is closely related to proximal policy optimization (PPO) and direct preference optimization (DPO), but has a minimizer that converges to an ideal Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution with the reward playing the role of an energy function. Furthermore, this algorithm is highly scalable, does not require reinforcement learning, and performs well relative to DPO when the number of preference observations per pairing is small. We deploy this approach to align molecular transformers and protein language models to generate molecules and protein sequences, respectively, with externally specified properties and find that it does so robustly, searching through diverse parts of chemical space.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation. Nonetheless, it was also witnessed that LLMs tend to produce inaccurate responses to specific queries. This deficiency can be traced to the tokenization step LLMs must undergo, which is an inevitable limitation inherent to all LLMs. In fact, incorrect tokenization is the critical point that hinders LLMs in understanding the input precisely, thus leading to unsatisfactory output. This defect is more obvious in Chinese scenarios. To demonstrate this flaw of LLMs, we construct an adversarial dataset, named as $\\textbf{ADT (Adversarial Dataset for Tokenizer)}$, which draws upon the vocabularies of various open-source LLMs to challenge LLMs' tokenization. ADT consists of two subsets: the manually constructed ADT-Human and the automatically generated ADT-Auto. Our empirical results reveal that our ADT is highly effective on challenging the tokenization of leading LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama-3, Deepseek-R1 and so on, thus degrading these LLMs' capabilities. Moreover, our method of automatic data generation has been proven efficient and robust, which can be applied to any open-source LLMs. In this paper, we substantially investigate LLMs' vulnerability in terms of challenging their token segmentation, which will shed light on the subsequent research of improving LLMs' capabilities through optimizing their tokenization process and algorithms.",

    "summary": "Effectively analyzing the comments to uncover latent intentions holds immense value in making strategic decisions across various domains. However, several challenges hinder the process of sentiment analysis including the lexical diversity exhibited in comments, the presence of long dependencies within the text, encountering unknown symbols and words, and dealing with imbalanced datasets. Moreover, existing sentiment analysis tasks mostly leveraged sequential models to encode the long dependent texts and it requires longer execution time as it processes the text sequentially. In contrast, the Transformer requires less execution time due to its parallel processing nature. In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid deep learning model, RoBERTa-BiLSTM, which combines the Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. RoBERTa is utilized to generate meaningful word embedding vectors, while BiLSTM effectively captures the contextual semantics of long-dependent texts. The RoBERTa-BiLSTM hybrid model leverages the strengths of both sequential and Transformer models to enhance performance in sentiment analysis. We conducted experiments using datasets from IMDb, Twitter US Airline, and Sentiment140 to evaluate the proposed model against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the RoBERTa-BiLSTM model surpasses baseline models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa-base, RoBERTa-GRU, and RoBERTa-LSTM), achieving accuracies of 80.74%, 92.36%, and 82.25% on the Twitter US Airline, IMDb, and Sentiment140 datasets, respectively. Additionally, the model achieves F1-scores of 80.73%, 92.35%, and 82.25% on the same datasets, respectively.",

With constant innovation in LLM serving optimizations and model architecture evolving at breakneck speed, the hardware requirements to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs) remain an open research question.\nTo answer the question, we present an analytical tool, GenZ, to efficiently navigate the relationship between diverse LLM model architectures(Dense, GQA, MoE, Mamba), LLM serving optimizations(Chunking, Speculative decoding, quanitization), and AI platform design parameters. Our tool estimates LLM inference performance metrics for the given scenario. We have validated against real hardware platforms running various different LLM models, achieving a max geomean error of this http URL use GenZ to identify compute, memory capacity, memory bandwidth, network latency, and network bandwidth requirements across diverse LLM inference use cases. We also study diverse architectural choices in use today (inspired by LLM serving platforms from several vendors) to help inform computer architects designing next-generation AI hardware accelerators and platforms. The trends and insights derived from GenZ can guide AI engineers deploying LLMs as well as computer architects designing next-generation hardware accelerators and platforms.

    "summary": "In this study, we investigate whether attention-based information flow inside large language models (LLMs) is aggregated through noticeable patterns for long context processing. Our observations reveal that LLMs aggregate information through Pyramidal Information Funneling where attention is scattering widely in lower layers, progressively consolidating within specific contexts, and ultimately focusing on critical tokens (a.k.a massive activation or attention sink) in higher layers. Motivated by these insights, we developed PyramidKV, a novel and effective KV cache compression method. This approach dynamically adjusts the KV cache size across different layers, allocating more cache in lower layers and less in higher ones, diverging from traditional methods that maintain a uniform KV cache size. Our experimental evaluations, utilizing the LongBench benchmark, show that PyramidKV matches the performance of models with a full KV cache while retaining only 12% of the KV cache, thus significantly reducing memory usage. In scenarios emphasizing memory efficiency, where only 0.7% of the KV cache is maintained, PyramidKV surpasses other KV cache compression techniques, achieving up to a 20.5 absolute accuracy improvement on TREC dataset. In the Needle-in-a-Haystack experiment, PyramidKV outperforms competing methods in maintaining long-context comprehension in LLMs; notably, retaining just 128 KV cache entries enables the LLAMA-3-70B model to achieve 100.0 Acc. performance.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit human-like intelligence, enabling them to simulate human behavior and support various applications that require both humanized communication and extensive knowledge reserves. Efforts are made to personify LLMs with special training data or hand-crafted prompts, while correspondingly faced with challenges such as insufficient data usage or rigid behavior patterns. Consequently, personified LLMs fail to capture personified knowledge or express persistent opinion. To fully unlock the potential of LLM personification, we propose PersLLM, a framework for better data construction and model tuning. For insufficient data usage, we incorporate strategies such as Chain-of-Thought prompting and anti-induction, improving the quality of data construction and capturing the personality experiences, knowledge, and thoughts more comprehensively. For rigid behavior patterns, we design the tuning process and introduce automated DPO to enhance the specificity and dynamism of the models' personalities, which leads to a more natural opinion communication. Both automated metrics and expert human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Case studies in human-machine interactions and multi-agent systems further suggest potential application scenarios and future directions for LLM personification.",

    "summary": "The prohibitive training costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a significant bottleneck in the development of next-generation LLMs. In this paper, we show that it is possible to significantly reduce the training costs of LLMs without sacrificing their performance. Specifically, we introduce patch-level training for LLMs, in which multiple tokens are aggregated into a unit of higher information density, referred to as a `patch', to serve as the fundamental text unit for training LLMs. During patch-level training, we feed the language model shorter sequences of patches and train it to predict the next patch, thereby processing the majority of the training data at a significantly reduced cost. Following this, the model continues token-level training on the remaining training data to align with the inference mode. Experiments on a diverse range of models (370M-2.7B parameters) demonstrate that patch-level training can reduce the overall training costs to 0.5$\\times$, without compromising the model performance compared to token-level training.

    "summary": "The quantization of large language models (LLMs) has been a prominent research area aimed at enabling their lightweight deployment in practice. Existing research about LLM's quantization has mainly explored the interplay between weights and activations, or employing auxiliary components while neglecting the necessity of adjusting weights during quantization. Consequently, original weight distributions frequently fail to yield desired results after round-to-nearest (RTN) quantization. Even though incorporating techniques such as mixed precision and low-rank error approximation in LLM's quantization can yield improved results, they inevitably introduce additional computational overhead. On the other hand, traditional techniques for weight quantization, such as Generative Post-Training Quantization, rely on manually tweaking weight distributions to minimize local errors, but they fall short of achieving globally optimal outcomes. Although the recently proposed Learnable Singular-value Increment improves global weight quantization by modifying weight distributions, it disrupts the original distribution considerably. This introduces pronounced bias toward the training data and can degrade downstream task performance. In this paper, we introduce Singular-value Diagonal Expansion, a more nuanced approach to refining weight distributions to achieve better quantization alignment. Furthermore, we introduce Cross-layer Learning that improves overall quantization outcomes by distributing errors more evenly across layers. Our plug-and-play weight-quantization methods demonstrate substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, including OmniQuant, DuQuant, and PrefixQuant.",

However, it also has many problems, it consumes a lot of memory because of the enormous database, and it cannot update the established index database in time when confronted with massive streaming data. To reduce the memory required for building the database and maintain accuracy simultaneously, we proposed a new approach integrating a streaming algorithm with k-means clustering into RAG. Our approach applied a streaming algorithm to update the index dynamically and reduce memory consumption. Additionally, the k-means algorithm clusters highly similar documents, and the query time would be shortened.

    "summary": "Q-learning is a widely used algorithm in reinforcement learning (RL), but its convergence can be slow, especially when the discount factor is close to one. Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) Q-learning, which introduces a relaxation factor to speed up convergence, addresses this issue but has two major limitations: In the tabular setting, the relaxation parameter depends on transition probability, making it not entirely model-free, and it suffers from overestimation bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a sample-based, model-free double SOR Q-learning algorithm. Theoretically and empirically, this algorithm is shown to be less biased than SOR Q-learning. Further, in the tabular setting, the convergence analysis under boundedness assumptions on iterates is discussed. The proposed algorithm is extended to large-scale problems using deep RL. Finally, the tabular version of the proposed algorithm is compared using roulette and grid world environments, while the deep RL version is tested on a maximization bias example and OpenAI Gym environments.",

    "summary": "Labelled data are limited and self-supervised learning is one of the most important approaches for reducing labelling requirements. While it has been extensively explored in the image domain, it has so far not received the same amount of attention in the acoustic domain. Yet, reducing labelling is a key requirement for many acoustic applications. Specifically in bioacoustic, there are rarely sufficient labels for fully supervised learning available. This has led to the widespread use of acoustic recognisers that have been pre-trained on unrelated data for bioacoustic tasks. We posit that training on the actual task data and combining self-supervised pre-training with few-shot classification is a superior approach that has the ability to deliver high accuracy even when only a few labels are available. To this end, we introduce and evaluate a new architecture that combines CNN-based preprocessing with feature extraction based on state space models (SSMs). This combination is motivated by the fact that CNN-based networks alone struggle to capture temporal information effectively, which is crucial for classifying acoustic signals. SSMs, specifically S4 and Mamba, on the other hand, have been shown to have an excellent ability to capture long-range dependencies in sequence data. We pre-train this architecture using contrastive learning on the actual task data and subsequent fine-tuning with an extremely small amount of labelled data. We evaluate the performance of this proposed architecture for ($n$-shot, $n$-class) classification on standard benchmarks as well as real-world data. Our evaluation shows that it outperforms state-of-the-art architectures on the few-shot classification problem.",

Our TimeShift evaluation method systematically probes LLMs for temporal reasoning, revealing that base models often outperform instruction-tuned and synthetic-trained counterparts on time-sensitive recall.

    "summary": "Machine Learning models in real-world applications must continuously learn new tasks to adapt to shifts in the data-generating distribution. Yet, for Continual Learning (CL), models often struggle to balance learning new tasks (plasticity) with retaining previous knowledge (memory stability). Consequently, they are susceptible to Catastrophic Forgetting, which degrades performance and undermines the reliability of deployed systems. In the Bayesian CL literature, variational methods tackle this challenge by employing a learning objective that recursively updates the posterior distribution while constraining it to stay close to its previous estimate. Nonetheless, we argue that these methods may be ineffective due to compounding approximation errors over successive recursions. To mitigate this, we propose new learning objectives that integrate the regularization effects of multiple previous posterior estimations, preventing individual errors from dominating future posterior updates and compounding over time. We reveal insightful connections between these objectives and Temporal-Difference methods, a popular learning mechanism in Reinforcement Learning and Neuroscience. Experiments on challenging CL benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates Catastrophic Forgetting, outperforming strong Variational CL methods.",

    "summary": "Inspired by the success of large language models, there is a trend toward developing graph foundation models to conduct diverse downstream tasks in various domains. However, current models often require extra fine-tuning to apply their learned structural and semantic representations to new graphs, which limits their versatility. Recent breakthroughs in zero-shot inductive reasoning on knowledge graphs (KGs), offer us a new perspective on extending KG reasoning to general graph applications. In this paper, we introduce SCR, a unified graph reasoning framework designed to train on knowledge graphs and effectively generalize across a wide range of graph tasks and domains. We begin by designing the task-specific KG structures to establish a unified topology for different task formats. Then we propose semantic-conditioned message passing, a novel mechanism addressing the inherent semantic isolation in traditional KG reasoning, by jointly modeling structural and semantic invariance patterns in graph representations. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we evaluate the inductive reasoning capability of SCR using 38 diverse graph datasets, covering node-level, link-level, and graph-level tasks across multiple domains. Our results show substantial performance gains over existing foundation models and supervised baselines, highlighting the efficacy and adaptability of our approach.",

    "summary": "Time series anomaly detection aims to identify unusual patterns in data or deviations from systems' expected behavior. The reconstruction-based methods are the mainstream in this task, which learn point-wise representation via unsupervised learning. However, the unlabeled anomaly points in training data may cause these reconstruction-based methods to learn and reconstruct anomalous data, resulting in the challenge of capturing normal patterns. In this paper, we propose a time series anomaly detection method based on implicit neural representation (INR) reconstruction, named TSINR, to address this challenge. Due to the property of spectral bias, TSINR enables prioritizing low-frequency signals and exhibiting poorer performance on high-frequency abnormal data. Specifically, we adopt INR to parameterize time series data as a continuous function and employ a transformer-based architecture to predict the INR of given data. As a result, the proposed TSINR method achieves the advantage of capturing the temporal continuity and thus is more sensitive to discontinuous anomaly data. In addition, we further design a novel form of INR continuous function to learn inter- and intra-channel information, and leverage a pre-trained large language model to amplify the intense fluctuations in anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSINR achieves superior overall performance on both univariate and multivariate time series anomaly detection benchmarks compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

    "summary": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of global mortality, necessitating accessible and accurate diagnostic tools. While cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) provides gold-standard insights into cardiac structure and function, its clinical utility is limited by high cost and complexity. In contrast, electrocardiography (ECG) is inexpensive and widely available but lacks the granularity of CMR. We propose CardioNets, a deep learning framework that translates 12-lead ECG signals into CMR-level functional parameters and synthetic images, enabling scalable cardiac assessment. CardioNets integrates cross-modal contrastive learning and generative pretraining, aligning ECG with CMR-derived cardiac phenotypes and synthesizing high-resolution CMR images via a masked autoregressive model. Trained on 159,819 samples from five cohorts, including the UK Biobank (n=42,483) and MIMIC-IV-ECG (n=164,550), and externally validated on independent clinical datasets (n=3,767), CardioNets achieved strong performance across disease screening and phenotype estimation tasks. In the UK Biobank, it improved cardiac phenotype regression R2 by 24.8% and cardiomyopathy AUC by up to 39.3% over baseline models. In MIMIC, it increased AUC for pulmonary hypertension detection by 5.6%. Generated CMR images showed 36.6% higher SSIM and 8.7% higher PSNR than prior approaches. In a reader study, ECG-only CardioNets achieved 13.9% higher accuracy than human physicians using both ECG and real CMR. These results suggest that CardioNets offers a promising, low-cost alternative to CMR for large-scale CVD screening, particularly in resource-limited settings. Future efforts will focus on clinical deployment and regulatory validation of ECG-based synthetic imaging.",

With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), NLRL can be practically implemented to achieve RL-like policy and value improvement by either pure prompting or gradient-based training.

    "summary": "Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains essential for knowledge-based question answering (KBQA), current paradigms face critical challenges under specific domains. Existing methods struggle with targeted adaptation on small-scale KBs: vanilla unsupervised training exhibits poor effectiveness, while fine-tuning incurs prohibitive costs of external signals. We present KBAlign, a self-supervised framework that enhances RAG systems through efficient model adaptation. Our key insight is to leverage the model's intrinsic capabilities for knowledge alignment through two innovative mechanisms: multi-grained self-annotation that captures global knowledge for data construction, and iterative tuning that accelerates convergence through self verification. This framework enables cost-effective model adaptation to specific textual KBs, without human supervision or external model assistance. Experiments demonstrate that KBAlign can achieve 90\\% of the performance gain obtained through GPT-4-supervised adaptation, while relying entirely on self-annotation of much smaller models. KBAlign significantly improves downstream QA accuracy across multiple domains with tiny costs, particularly benefiting scenarios requiring deep knowledge integration from specialized corpora. We release our experimental data, models, and process analyses to the community for further exploration (this https URL).",

    "summary": "We propose two simple, principled and practical algorithms that enjoy provable scaling laws for the test-time compute of large language models (LLMs). The first one is a two-stage knockout-style algorithm: given an input problem, it first generates multiple candidate solutions, and then aggregate them via a knockout tournament for the final output. Assuming that the LLM can generate a correct solution with non-zero probability and do better than a random guess in comparing a pair of correct and incorrect solutions, we prove theoretically that the failure probability of this algorithm decays to zero exponentially or by a power law (depending on the specific way of scaling) as its test-time compute grows. The second one is a two-stage league-style algorithm, where each candidate is evaluated by its average win rate against multiple opponents, rather than eliminated upon loss to a single opponent. Under analogous but more robust assumptions, we prove that its failure probability also decays to zero exponentially with more test-time compute. Both algorithms require a black-box LLM and nothing else (e.g., no verifier or reward model) for a minimalistic implementation, which makes them appealing for practical applications and easy to adapt for different tasks. Through extensive experiments with diverse models and datasets, we validate the proposed theories and demonstrate the outstanding scaling properties of both algorithms.",

Among the fine-tuning methods, adapter-tuning provides a parameter-efficient fine-tuning by introducing lightweight trainable modules while keeping most pre-trained parameters frozen. However, existing adapter-tuning methods still impose substantial resource usage. Through our investigation, we show that each adapter unequally contributes to both task performance and resource usage. Motivated by this insight, we propose Selective Adapter FrEezing (SAFE), which gradually freezes less important adapters early to reduce unnecessary resource usage while maintaining performance. In our experiments, SAFE reduces memory usage, computation amount, and training time by 42.85\\%, 34.59\\%, and 11.82\\%, respectively, while achieving comparable or better task performance compared to the baseline. We also demonstrate that SAFE induces regularization effect, thereby smoothing the loss landscape, which enables the model to generalize better by avoiding sharp minima.",

    "summary": "Multi-objective learning endeavors to concurrently optimize multiple objectives using a single model, aiming to achieve high and balanced performance across diverse objectives. However, this often entails a more complex optimization problem, particularly when navigating potential conflicts between objectives, leading to solutions with higher memory requirements and computational complexity. This paper introduces a Multi-Objective Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning (MOGCSL) framework for automatically learning to achieve multiple objectives from offline sequential data. MOGCSL extends the conventional GCSL method to multi-objective scenarios by redefining goals from one-dimensional scalars to multi-dimensional vectors. It benefits from naturally eliminating the need for complex architectures and optimization constraints. Moreover, MOGCSL effectively filters out uninformative or noisy instances that fail to achieve desirable long-term rewards across multiple objectives. We also introduces a novel goal-selection algorithm for MOGCSL to model and identify \"high\" achievable goals for inference.\nWhile MOGCSL is quite general, we focus on its application to the next action prediction problem in commercial-grade recommender systems. In this context, any viable solution needs to be reasonably scalable and also be robust to large amounts of noisy data that is characteristic of this application space. We show that MOGCSL performs admirably on both counts by extensive experiments on real-world recommendation datasets. Also, analysis and experiments are included to explain its strength in discounting the noisier portions of training data in recommender systems with multiple objectives.",

(b) Empirically, we demonstrate that mutual distillation between policies contributes to such robustness, enabling the spontaneous emergence of invariant representations over pixel inputs. Overall, our findings challenge the conventional view of distillation as merely a means of knowledge transfer, offering a novel perspective on the generalization in deep reinforcement learning.",

    "summary": "Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are widely used to assess medical students' communication skills, but scoring interview-based assessments is time-consuming and potentially subject to human bias. This study explored the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate OSCE evaluations using the Master Interview Rating Scale (MIRS). We compared the performance of four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Llama 3.1, and Gemini 1.5 Pro) in evaluating OSCE transcripts across all 28 items of the MIRS under the conditions of zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), few-shot, and multi-step prompting. The models were benchmarked against a dataset of 10 OSCE cases with 174 expert consensus scores available. Model performance was measured using three accuracy metrics (exact, off-by-one, thresholded). Averaging across all MIRS items and OSCE cases, LLMs performed with low exact accuracy (0.27 to 0.44), and moderate to high off-by-one accuracy (0.67 to 0.87) and thresholded accuracy (0.75 to 0.88). A zero temperature parameter ensured high intra-rater reliability ({\\alpha} = 0.98 for GPT-4o). CoT, few-shot, and multi-step techniques proved valuable when tailored to specific assessment items. The performance was consistent across MIRS items, independent of encounter phases and communication domains. We demonstrated the feasibility of AI-assisted OSCE evaluation and provided benchmarking of multiple LLMs across multiple prompt techniques. Our work provides a baseline performance assessment for LLMs that lays a foundation for future research into automated assessment of clinical communication skills.",

The core innovation is Moment Transform Projection (MTP), which maps a label, represented as a distribution over features, to a real number. Using MTP, we derive a data point projection that transforms datasets into one-dimensional distributions. The s-OTDD is defined as the expected Wasserstein distance between the projected distributions, with respect to random projection parameters. Leveraging the closed form solution of one-dimensional optimal transport, s-OTDD achieves (near-)linear computational complexity in the number of data points and feature dimensions and is independent of the number of classes. With its geometrically meaningful projection, s-OTDD strongly correlates with the optimal transport dataset distance while being more efficient than existing dataset discrepancy measures. Moreover, it correlates well with the performance gap in transfer learning and classification accuracy in data augmentation.",

    "summary": "Despite deep learning's remarkable advances in style transfer across various domains, generating controllable performance-level musical style transfer for complete symbolically represented musical works remains a challenging area of research. Much of this is owed to limited datasets, especially for genres such as jazz, and the lack of unified models that can handle multiple music generation tasks. This paper presents ImprovNet, a transformer-based architecture that generates expressive and controllable musical improvisations through a self-supervised corruption-refinement training strategy. The improvisational style transfer is aimed at making meaningful modifications to one or more musical elements - melody, harmony or rhythm of the original composition with respect to the target genre. ImprovNet unifies multiple capabilities within a single model: it can perform cross-genre and intra-genre improvisations, harmonize melodies with genre-specific styles, and execute short prompt continuation and infilling tasks. The model's iterative generation framework allows users to control the degree of style transfer and structural similarity to the original composition. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate ImprovNet's effectiveness in generating musically coherent improvisations while maintaining structural relationships with the original pieces. The model outperforms Anticipatory Music Transformer in short continuation and infilling tasks and successfully achieves recognizable genre conversion, with 79\\% of participants correctly identifying jazz-style improvisations of classical pieces.

Enhancing the performance of LLMs in QA contexts is becoming increasingly vital for advancing their development and applicability. This paper introduces ARR, an intuitive, effective, and general QA solving method that explicitly incorporates three key steps: analyzing the intent of the question, retrieving relevant information, and reasoning step by step. Notably, this paper is the first to introduce intent analysis in QA, which plays a vital role in ARR. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 diverse QA tasks demonstrate that ARR consistently outperforms the baseline methods. Ablation and case studies further validate the positive contributions of each ARR component. Furthermore, experiments involving variations in prompt design indicate that ARR maintains its effectiveness regardless of the specific prompt formulation. Additionally, extensive evaluations across various model sizes, LLM series, and generation settings solidify the effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of ARR.",

    "summary": "Environmental crime is the third largest criminal activity worldwide, with significant revenues coming from illegal management of solid waste. Thanks to the increasing availability and the decreasing cost of Very High Resolution Remote Sensing (VHR RS) images, the fight against environmental crime can nowadays rely on modern image-analysis tools to support photo-interpretation for scanning vast territories in search of illegal waste disposal sites. This paper illustrates a semi-automatic waste detection pipeline, developed in collaboration with a regional environmental protection agency, for detecting candidate illegal dumping sites in VHR RS images. To optimize the effectiveness of the waste detector, extensive experiments evaluate such design choices as the network architecture, the ground resolution and geographic span of the input images, as well as the pretraining procedures. The best model attains remarkable performance, achieving 92.02% F1-Score and 94.56% Accuracy. A generalization study assesses the performance variation when the detector processes images from a territory substantially different from the one used during training, incurring only a moderate performance loss, i.e., 6.5% decrease in the F1-Score. Finally, an exercise in which photo interpreters compare the territory scanning effort with and without the support of the waste detector assesses the concrete benefit of using a computer-aided image analysis tool in a professional environment protection agency. Results show that a reduction up to 30% of the time spent for waste site detection can be attained.",

    "summary": "Power grid operation is becoming more complex due to the increase in generation of renewable energy. The recent series of Learning To Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions have encouraged the use of artificial agents to assist human dispatchers in operating power grids. However, the combinatorial nature of the action space poses a challenge to both conventional optimizers and learned controllers. Action space factorization, which breaks down decision-making into smaller sub-tasks, is one approach to tackle the curse of dimensionality. In this study, we propose a centrally coordinated multi-agent (CCMA) architecture for action space factorization. In this approach, regional agents propose actions and subsequently a coordinating agent selects the final action. We investigate several implementations of the CCMA architecture, and benchmark in different experimental settings against various L2RPN baseline approaches. The CCMA architecture exhibits higher sample efficiency and superior final performance than the baseline approaches. The results suggest high potential of the CCMA approach for further application in higher-dimensional L2RPN as well as real-world power grid settings.",

With growing regulatory pressure to address these issues through greater transparency, ML model vendors face challenges balancing these requirements against confidentiality for data and intellectual property needs. We propose Atlas, a framework that enables fully attestable ML pipelines. Atlas leverages open specifications for data and software supply chain provenance to collect verifiable records of model artifact authenticity and end-to-end lineage metadata. Atlas combines trusted hardware and transparency logs to enhance metadata integrity, preserve data confidentiality, and limit unauthorized access during ML pipeline operations, from training through deployment.

Experimental results show that T$^3$Former achieves 1.44$\\times$ speedup (26 FPS), improves mean IoU to 36.09, and reduces mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters.

To address these issues, we propose Embodied Mobile Manipulation in Open Environments (EMMOE), a benchmark that requires agents to interpret user instructions and execute long-horizon everyday tasks in continuous space. EMMOE seamlessly integrates high-level and low-level embodied tasks into a unified framework, along with three new metrics for more diverse assessment.

We present the Reasoning Model Implicit Association Test (RM-IAT) to study implicit bias-like processing in reasoning models, which are LLMs using step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks. Using RM-IAT, we find o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 require more tokens when processing association-incompatible information, mirroring human implicit bias patterns. Conversely, Claude 3.7 Sonnet displays reversed patterns for race and gender tests, requiring more tokens for association-compatible information. This reversal appears linked to differences in safety mechanism activation, increasing deliberation in sensitive contexts. These findings suggest AI systems can exhibit processing patterns analogous to both human implicit bias and bias correction mechanisms.",

Furthermore, they suffer from inefficient, reactive mapping refinements due to reliance on isolated node-level distance as guidance. To address these issues, we propose GEN, a novel learning-based approach for flexible GED approximation. GEN addresses the varying costs adaptation by integrating operation costs prior to match establishment, enabling mappings to dynamically adapt to cost variations. Furthermore, GEN introduces a proactive guidance optimization strategy that captures graph-level dependencies between matches, allowing informed matching decisions in a single step without costly iterative refinements. Extensive evaluations on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GEN achieves up to 37.8% reduction in GED approximation error and 72.7% reduction in inference time compared with state-of-the-art methods, while consistently maintaining robustness under diverse cost settings and graph sizes.",

To close this gap, this work first introduces CLASH (Character perspective-based LLM Assessments in Situations with High-stakes), a meticulously curated dataset consisting of 345 high-impact dilemmas along with 3,795 individual perspectives of diverse values. In particular, we design CLASH in a way to support the study of critical aspects of value-based decision-making processes which are missing from prior work, including understanding decision ambivalence and psychological discomfort as well as capturing the temporal shifts of values in characters' perspectives. By benchmarking 10 open and closed frontier models, we uncover several key findings. (1) Even the strongest models, such as GPT-4o and Claude-Sonnet, achieve less than 50% accuracy in identifying situations where the decision should be ambivalent, while they perform significantly better in clear-cut scenarios. (2) While LLMs reasonably predict psychological discomfort as marked by human, they inadequately comprehend perspectives involving value shifts, indicating a need for LLMs to reason over complex values. (3) Our experiments also reveal a significant correlation between LLMs' value preferences and their steerability towards a given value. (4) Finally, LLMs exhibit greater steerability when engaged in value reasoning from a third-party perspective, compared to a first-person setup, though certain value pairs benefit uniquely from the first-person framing.",

While LVLMs excel in multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under user-defined risk levels ($\\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous control of \\textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain strictly below $\\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes inversely with $\\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces theoretical guarantees across all $\\alpha$ values. The framework achieves stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios, underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems, offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware decision-making.",

    "summary": "Task robust adaptation is a long-standing pursuit in sequential decision-making. Some risk-averse strategies, e.g., the conditional value-at-risk principle, are incorporated in domain randomization or meta reinforcement learning to prioritize difficult tasks in optimization, which demand costly intensive evaluations. The efficiency issue prompts the development of robust active task sampling to train adaptive policies, where risk-predictive models are used to surrogate policy evaluation. This work characterizes the optimization pipeline of robust active task sampling as a Markov decision process, posits theoretical and practical insights, and constitutes robustness concepts in risk-averse scenarios. Importantly, we propose an easy-to-implement method, referred to as Posterior and Diversity Synergized Task Sampling (PDTS), to accommodate fast and robust sequential decision-making. Extensive experiments show that PDTS unlocks the potential of robust active task sampling, significantly improves the zero-shot and few-shot adaptation robustness in challenging tasks, and even accelerates the learning process under certain scenarios.

    "summary": "Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through reinforcement learning (RL). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's interpretability and performance. To this end, we introduce a new class of generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. RM-R1 features a chain-of-rubrics (CoR) mechanism -- self-generating sample-level chat rubrics or math/code solutions, and evaluating candidate responses against them. The training of M-R1 consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across three reward model benchmarks on average, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., INF-ORM-Llama3.1-70B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 4.9%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at this https URL.",

Today's reliance on a single dominant platform limits portability, creates vendor lock-in, and raises barriers for new AI hardware. In this work, we make the case for combining just-in-time (JIT) compilation with kernel parameter autotuning to enable portable LLM inference with state-of-the-art performance without code changes. Focusing on flash attention -- a widespread performance critical LLM kernel -- we demonstrate that this approach explores up to 15x more kernel parameter configurations, produces significantly more diverse code across multiple dimensions, and even outperforms vendor-optimized implementations by up to 230%, all while reducing kernel code size by 70x and eliminating manual code optimizations. Our results highlight autotuning as a promising path to unlocking model portability across GPU vendors.",

    "summary": "Human networks greatly impact important societal outcomes, including wealth and health inequality, poverty, and bullying. As such, understanding human networks is critical to learning how to promote favorable societal outcomes. As a step toward better understanding human networks, we compare and contrast several methods for learning, from a small data set, models of human behavior in a strategic network game called the Junior High Game (JHG). These modeling methods differ with respect to the assumptions they use to parameterize human behavior (behavior vs. community-aware behavior) and the moments they model (mean vs. distribution). Results show that the highest-performing method, called hCAB, models the distribution of human behavior rather than the mean and assumes humans use community-aware behavior rather than behavior matching. When applied to small societies (6-11 individuals), the hCAB model closely mirrors the population dynamics of human groups (with notable differences). Additionally, in a user study, human participants were unable to distinguish individual hCAB agents from other humans, thus illustrating that the hCAB model also produces plausible (individual) human behavior in this strategic network game.",

    "summary": "Classification of multi-dimensional time series from real-world systems require fine-grained learning of complex features such as cross-dimensional dependencies and intra-class variations-all under the practical challenge of low training data availability. However, standard deep learning (DL) struggles to learn generalizable features in low-data environments due to model overfitting. We propose a versatile yet data-efficient framework, Intelligently Augmented Contrastive Tensor Factorization (ITA-CTF), to learn effective representations from multi-dimensional time series. The CTF module learns core explanatory components of the time series (e.g., sensor factors, temporal factors), and importantly, their joint dependencies. Notably, unlike standard tensor factorization (TF), the CTF module incorporates a new contrastive loss optimization to induce similarity learning and class-awareness into the learnt representations for better classification performance. To strengthen this contrastive learning, the preceding ITA module generates targeted but informative augmentations that highlight realistic intra-class patterns in the original data, while preserving class-wise properties. This is achieved by dynamically sampling a \"soft\" class prototype to guide the warping of each query data sample, which results in an augmentation that is intelligently pattern-mixed between the \"soft\" class prototype and the query sample. These augmentations enable the CTF module to recognize complex intra-class variations despite the limited original training data, and seek out invariant class-wise properties for accurate classification performance. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on five different classification tasks. Compared to standard TF and several DL benchmarks, notable performance improvements up to 18.7% were achieved.",

To resolve the time-inconsistency issue, we consider an augmented state space and an auxiliary variable and recast the problem as a two-state optimization problem. We propose a customized Actor-Critic algorithm and establish some theoretical approximation guarantees. A key theoretical contribution is that our results do not require the Markov decision process to be continuous.

We validate our approach in simulation experiments with a financial application in statistical arbitrage trading, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm.",

    "summary": "To perform in-context learning, language models must extract signals from individual few-shot examples, aggregate these into a learned prediction rule, and then apply this rule to new examples. How is this implemented in the forward pass of modern transformer models? To study this, we consider a structured family of few-shot learning tasks for which the true prediction rule is to add an integer $k$ to the input. We find that Llama-3-8B attains high accuracy on this task for a range of $k$, and localize its few-shot ability to just three attention heads via a novel optimization approach. We further show the extracted signals lie in a six-dimensional subspace, where four of the dimensions track the unit digit and the other two dimensions track overall magnitude. We finally examine how these heads extract information from individual few-shot examples, identifying a self-correction mechanism in which mistakes from earlier examples are suppressed by later examples. Our results demonstrate how tracking low-dimensional subspaces across a forward pass can provide insight into fine-grained computational structures.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we explore a novel approach to 3D anomaly detection (AD) that goes beyond merely identifying anomalies based on structural characteristics. Our primary perspective is that most anomalies arise from unpredictable defective forces originating from both internal and external sources. To address these anomalies, we seek out opposing forces that can help correct them. Therefore, we introduce the Mechanics Complementary Model-based Framework for the 3D-AD task (MC4AD), which generates internal and external corrective forces for each point. We first propose a Diverse Anomaly-Generation (DA-Gen) module designed to simulate various types of anomalies. Next, we present the Corrective Force Prediction Network (CFP-Net), which uses complementary representations for point-level analysis to simulate the different contributions from internal and external corrective forces. To ensure the corrective forces are constrained effectively, we have developed a combined loss function that includes a new symmetric loss and an overall loss. Notably, we implement a Hierarchical Quality Control (HQC) strategy based on a three-way decision process and contribute a dataset titled Anomaly-IntraVariance, which incorporates intraclass variance to evaluate our model. As a result, the proposed MC4AD has been proven effective through theory and experimentation. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach yields nine state-of-the-art performances, achieving optimal results with minimal parameters and the fastest inference speed across five existing datasets, in addition to the proposed Anomaly-IntraVariance dataset.

Consequently, they are often limited to single physical specification and struggle to learn transferable knowledge across different embodiments and environments. To confront these limitations, we propose UniVLA, a new framework for learning cross-embodiment vision-language-action (VLA) policies. Our key innovation is to derive task-centric action representations from videos with a latent action model. This enables us to exploit extensive data across a wide spectrum of embodiments and perspectives. To mitigate the effect of task-irrelevant dynamics, we incorporate language instructions and establish a latent action model within the DINO feature space. Learned from internet-scale videos, the generalist policy can be deployed to various robots through efficient latent action decoding. We obtain state-of-the-art results across multiple manipulation and navigation benchmarks, as well as real-robot deployments. UniVLA achieves superior performance over OpenVLA with less than 1/20 of pretraining compute and 1/10 of downstream data.

Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Sim introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes.

    "summary": "Subjective Answer Grading (SAG) plays a crucial role in education, standardized testing, and automated assessment systems, particularly for evaluating short-form responses in Short Answer Scoring (SAS). However, existing approaches often produce coarse-grained scores and lack detailed reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as zero-shot evaluators, they remain susceptible to bias, inconsistencies with human judgment, and limited transparency in scoring decisions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SAS-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based SAS tasks. SAS-Bench provides fine-grained, step-wise scoring, expert-annotated error categories, and a diverse range of question types derived from real-world subject-specific exams. This benchmark facilitates detailed evaluation of model reasoning processes and explainability. We also release an open-source dataset containing 1,030 questions and 4,109 student responses, each annotated by domain experts. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments with various LLMs, identifying major challenges in scoring science-related questions and highlighting the effectiveness of few-shot prompting in improving scoring accuracy. Our work offers valuable insights into the development of more robust, fair, and educationally meaningful LLM-based evaluation systems.",

    "summary": "In this work, we present GPDiT, a Generative Pre-trained Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer that unifies the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive modeling for long-range video synthesis, within a continuous latent space. Instead of predicting discrete tokens, GPDiT autoregressively predicts future latent frames using a diffusion loss, enabling natural modeling of motion dynamics and semantic consistency across frames. This continuous autoregressive framework not only enhances generation quality but also endows the model with representation capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight causal attention variant and a parameter-free rotation-based time-conditioning mechanism, improving both the training and inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPDiT achieves strong performance in video generation quality, video representation ability, and few-shot learning tasks, highlighting its potential as an effective framework for video modeling in continuous space.",

    "summary": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel in computer vision tasks, especially, few-shot learning (FSL), which is increasingly important for generalizing from limited examples. However, DNNs are computationally expensive with scalability issues in real world. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their event-driven nature and low energy consumption, are particularly efficient in processing sparse and dynamic data, though they still encounter difficulties in capturing complex spatiotemporal features and performing accurate cross-class comparisons. To further enhance the performance and efficiency of SNNs in few-shot learning, we propose a few-shot learning framework based on SNNs, which combines a self-feature extractor module and a cross-feature contrastive module to refine feature representation and reduce power consumption. We apply the combination of temporal efficient training loss and InfoNCE loss to optimize the temporal dynamics of spike trains and enhance the discriminative power. Experimental results show that the proposed FSL-SNN significantly improves the classification performance on the neuromorphic dataset N-Omniglot, and also achieves competitive performance to ANNs on static datasets such as CUB and miniImageNet with low power consumption.",

    "summary": "An algorithm that outputs predictions about the state of the world will almost always be designed with the implicit or explicit goal of outputting accurate predictions (i.e., predictions that are likely to be true). In addition, the rise of increasingly powerful predictive algorithms brought about by the recent revolution in artificial intelligence has led to an emphasis on building predictive algorithms that are fair, in the sense that their predictions do not systematically evince bias or bring about harm to certain individuals or groups. This state of affairs presents two conceptual challenges. First, the goals of accuracy and fairness can sometimes be in tension, and there are no obvious normative guidelines for managing the trade-offs between these two desiderata when they arise. Second, there are many distinct ways of measuring both the accuracy and fairness of a predictive algorithm; here too, there are no obvious guidelines on how to aggregate our preferences for predictive algorithms that satisfy disparate measures of fairness and accuracy to various extents. The goal of this paper is to address these challenges by arguing that there are good reasons for using a linear combination of accuracy and fairness metrics to measure the all-things-considered value of a predictive algorithm for agents who care about both accuracy and fairness. My argument depends crucially on a classic result in the preference aggregation literature due to Harsanyi. After making this formal argument, I apply my result to an analysis of accuracy-fairness trade-offs using the COMPAS dataset compiled by Angwin et al.",

However, existing end-to-end OSEDA flows have mostly been demonstrated on small designs and have not yet enabled large, industry-grade chips such as Linux-capable systems-on-chip (SoCs). This work presents Basilisk, the largest end-to-end open-source SoC to date. Basilisk's 34 mm2, 2.7 MGE design features a 64-bit Linux-capable RISC-V core, a lightweight 124 MB/s DRAM controller, and extensive IO, including a USB 1.1 host, a video output, and a fully digital 62 Mb/s chip-to-chip (C2C) link. We implement Basilisk in IHP's open 130 nm BiCMOS technology, significantly improving on the state-of-the-art (SoA) OSEDA flow. Our enhancements of the Yosys-based synthesis flow improve design timing and area by 2.3x and 1.6x, respectively, while consuming significantly less system resources. By tuning OpenROAD place and route (P&R) to our design and technology, we decrease the die size by 12%. The fabricated Basilisk chip reaches 62 MHz at its nominal 1.2 V core voltage and up to 102 MHz at 1.64 V. It achieves a peak energy efficiency of 18.9 DP MFLOP/s/W at 0.88 V.",

Traditional approaches often struggle to concurrently evaluate functional correctness and performance, or balance simulation speed with modeling accuracy. This paper introduces an integrated co-simulation framework leveraging Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) and Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM) for RISC-V processor validation. We present a configurable UVM-TLM model (vmodel) of a superscalar, out-of-order RISC-V core, featuring key microarchitectural modeling techniques such as credit-based pipeline flow control. This environment facilitates unified functional verification via co-simulation against the Spike ISA simulator and enables early-stage performance assessment using benchmarks like CoreMark, orchestrated within UVM. The methodology prioritizes integration, simulation efficiency, and acceptable fidelity for architectural exploration over cycle-level precision. Experimental results validate functional correctness and significant simulation speedup over RTL approaches, accelerating design iterations and enhancing verification coverage.",

    "summary": "Integrated circuit implementations of coupled oscillator networks have recently gained increased attention. The focus is usually on using these networks for analogue computing, for example for solving computational optimization tasks. For use within analog computing, these networks are run close to critical dynamics. On the other hand, such networks are also used as an analogy of transport networks such as electrical power grids to answer the question of how exactly such critical dynamic states can be avoided. However, simulating large network of coupled oscillators is computationally intensive, with specifc regards to electronic ones. We have developed an integrated circuit using integrated Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) with modifications, that allows to flexibly vary the topology as well as a complexity parameter of the network during operation. The proposed architecture, inspired by the brain, employs a clustered architecture, with each cluster containing 7 PLLs featuring programmable coupling mechanisms. Additionally, the inclusion of a RISC-V processor enables future algorithmic implementations. Thus, we provide a practical alternative for large-scale network simulations both in the field of analog computing and transport network stability research.",

Much recent progress in this field has used randomized heuristic search to find new CPDs, often over a finite field. However, if these techniques fail to find a CPD with low enough rank, they cannot prove that no such CPD exists. Consequently, these methods fail to resolve certain long-standing questions, such as whether the tensor corresponding to $3\\times 3$ matrix multiplication has rank less than 23.\nTo make progress on these problems, we develop a novel algorithm that preserves exactness, i.e. they can provably verify whether or not a given tensor has a specified rank. Compared to brute force, when searching for a rank-$R$ CPD of a $n_0\\times\\dots\\times n_{D-1}$-shaped tensor over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}$, where $n_0\\ge \\dots\\ge n_{D-1}$, our algorithm saves a multiplicative factor of roughly $|\\mathbb{F}|^{R(n_0-1)+n_0(\\sum_{d\\ge 1} n_d)}$. Additionally, our algorithm runs in polynomial time. We also find a novel algorithm to search border CPDs, a variant of CPDs that is also important in fast matrix multiplication.\nFinally, we study the maximum rank problem and give new upper and lower bounds, both for families of tensor shapes and specific shapes. Although our CPD search algorithms are still too slow to resolve the rank of $3\\times 3$ matrix multiplication, we are able to utilize them in this problem by adding extra search pruners that do not affect exactness or increase asymptotic running time.",

    "summary": "The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is a well-known example of monotonic reasoning, of intense practical interest due to fast solvers, complemented by rigorous fine-grained complexity results. However, for non-monotonic reasoning, e.g., abductive reasoning, comparably little is known outside classic complexity theory. In this paper we take a first step of bridging the gap between monotonic and non-monotonic reasoning by analyzing the complexity of intractable abduction problems under the seemingly overlooked but natural parameter n: the number of variables in the knowledge base. We obtain several positive results for $\\Sigma^P_2$- as well as NP- and coNP-complete fragments, which implies the first example of beating exhaustive search for a $\\Sigma^P_2$-complete problem (to the best of our knowledge). We complement this with lower bounds and for many fragments rule out improvements under the (strong) exponential-time hypothesis.",

    "summary": "Resource allocation problems in which demand is splittable are usually solved using different solution methods from their unsplittable equivalents. Although splittable problem instances can be the easier of the two (for example, they might simply correspond to a linear relaxation of a discrete problem), there exist many problems, including routing problems, for which the converse is true. That is, the technology for solving unsplittable problems is mature, but the splittable counterpart is not. For such problems, one strategy that has recently shown potential is the use of an a priori splitting rule in which each customer's demand is split into smaller pieces in advance, which enables one to simply solve the splittable problem as an instance of the unsplittable version. An important factor to consider is the number of pieces that result after this splitting. A large numbers of pieces will allow more splitting patterns to be realizable, but will result in a larger problem instance. In this paper, we introduce a splitting rule that minimizes the number of pieces, subject to the constraint that all demand splitting patterns remain feasible. Computational experiments on benchmark instances for the vehicle routing problem and a time-windows extension show that the solution quality of our proposed splitting rule can match the performance of existing approaches.",

    "summary": "The multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem asks to find a set of paths on a graph such that when synchronously following these paths the agents never encounter a conflict. In the most widespread MAPF formulation, the so-called Classical MAPF, the agents sizes are neglected and two types of conflicts are considered: occupying the same vertex or using the same edge at the same time step. Meanwhile in numerous practical applications, e.g. in robotics, taking into account the agents' sizes is vital to ensure that the MAPF solutions can be safely executed. Introducing large agents yields an additional type of conflict arising when one agent follows an edge and its body overlaps with the body of another agent that is actually not using this same edge (e.g. staying still at some distinct vertex of the graph). Until now it was not clear how harder the problem gets when such conflicts are to be considered while planning. Specifically, it was known that Classical MAPF problem on an undirected graph can be solved in polynomial time, however no complete polynomial-time algorithm was presented to solve MAPF with large agents. In this paper we, for the first time, establish that the latter problem is NP-hard and, thus, if P!=NP no polynomial algorithm for it can, unfortunately, be presented. Our proof is based on the prevalent in the field technique of reducing the seminal 3SAT problem (which is known to be an NP-complete problem) to the problem at hand. In particular, for an arbitrary 3SAT formula we procedurally construct a dedicated graph with specific start and goal vertices and show that the given 3SAT formula is satisfiable iff the corresponding path finding instance has a solution.",

    "summary": "The simulation of large-scale classical systems in exponentially small space on quantum computers has gained attention. The prior work demonstrated that a quantum algorithm offers an exponential speedup over any classical algorithm in simulating classical dynamics with long-range interactions. However, many real-world classical systems, such as those arising from partial differential equations, exhibit only local interactions. The question remains whether quantum algorithms can still provide exponential speedup under this condition. In this work, we thoroughly characterize the computational complexity of quantum algorithms for simulating such geometrically local systems. First, we dequantize the quantum algorithm for simulating short-time (polynomial-time) dynamics of such systems. This implies that the problem of simulating this dynamics does not yield any exponential quantum advantage. Second, we show that quantum algorithms for short-time dynamics have the same computational complexity as polynomial-time probabilistic classical computation. Third, we show that the computational complexity of quantum algorithms for long-time (exponential-time) dynamics is captured by exponential-time and polynomial-space quantum computation. This suggests a super-polynomial time advantage when restricting the computation to polynomial-space, or an exponential space advantage otherwise. This work offers new insights into the complexity of classical dynamics governed by partial differential equations, providing a pathway for achieving quantum advantage in practical problems.",

The complexity not only increases computational costs for atomistic simulations but also makes it difficult for generative AI models to deliver accurate property predictions and realistic structure generation. In this work, we introduce GlassVAE, a hierarchical graph variational autoencoder that uses graph representations to learn compact, rotation, translation, and permutation invariant embeddings of atomic configurations. The resulting structured latent space not only enables efficient generation of novel, physically plausible structures but also supports exploration of the glass energy landscape. To enforce structural realism and physical fidelity, we augment GlassVAE with two physics informed regularizers, a radial distribution function (RDF) loss that captures characteristic short and medium range ordering and an energy regression loss that reflects the broad configurational energetics. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results highlight the critical impact of these regularizers. By encoding high dimensional atomistic data into a compact latent vector and decoding it into structures with accurate energy predictions, GlassVAE provides a fast, physics aware path for modeling and designing disordered materials.",

    "summary": "This paper presents Space-Time MultiGrid (STMG) methods which are suitable for performing topology optimisation of transient heat conduction problems. The proposed methods use a pointwise smoother and uniform Cartesian space-time meshes. For problems with high contrast in the diffusivity, it was found that it is beneficial to define a coarsening strategy based on the geometric mean of the minimum and maximum diffusivity. However, other coarsening strategies may be better for other smoothers. Several methods of discretising the coarse levels were tested. Of these, it was best to use a method which averages the thermal resistivities on the finer levels. However, this was likely a consequence of the fact that only one spatial dimension was considered for the test problems. A second coarsening strategy was proposed which ensures spatial resolution on the coarse grids. Mixed results were found for this strategy. The proposed STMG methods were used as a solver for a one-dimensional topology optimisation problem. In this context, the adjoint problem was also solved using the STMG methods. The STMG methods were sufficiently robust for this application, since they converged during every optimisation cycle. It was found that the STMG methods also work for the adjoint problem when the prolongation operator only sends information forwards in time, even although the direction of time for the adjoint problem is backwards.",

    "summary": "With the growing demand for healthy foods, agricultural product price forecasting has become increasingly important. Hass avocados, as a high-value crop, exhibit complex price fluctuations influenced by factors such as seasonality, region, and weather. Traditional prediction models often struggle with highly nonlinear and dynamic data. To address this, we propose a hybrid deep learning model, TCN-MLP-Attention Architecture, combining Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) for sequential feature extraction, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for nonlinear interactions, and an Attention mechanism for dynamic feature weighting. The dataset used covers over 50,000 records of Hass avocado sales across the U.S. from 2015 to 2018, including variables such as sales volume, average price, time, region, weather, and variety type, collected from point-of-sale systems and the Hass Avocado Board. After systematic preprocessing, including missing value imputation and feature normalization, the proposed model was trained and evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate that the TCN-MLP-Attention model achieves excellent predictive performance, with an RMSE of 1.23 and an MSE of 1.51, outperforming traditional methods. This research provides a scalable and effective approach for time series forecasting in agricultural markets and offers valuable insights for intelligent supply chain management and price strategy optimization.",

Traditional approaches require retraining models for each new system, limiting generalizability and efficiency. In this work, we take a step toward foundation models for chemical reactor modeling by introducing a neural network framework that generalizes across diverse reactor types and rapidly adapts to new chemical processes. Our approach leverages meta-learning to pretrain the model on a broad set of reactor dynamics, enabling efficient adaptation to unseen reactions with minimal data. To further enhance generalizability, we incorporate physics-informed fine-tuning, ensuring physically consistent adaptation to new reactor conditions. Our framework is evaluated across three integer-order fundamental reactor types - continuous stirred tank reactors, batch reactors, and plug flow reactors - demonstrating superior few-shot adaptation compared to conventional data-driven, physics-informed, and transfer learning approaches. By combining meta-learning with physics-informed adaptation, this work lays the foundation for a generalizable modeling framework, advancing the development of foundation models for chemical engineering applications.

    "summary": "Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) offers a powerful paradigm of integrating data with physical laws to address important scientific problems, such as parameter estimation, inferring hidden physics, equation discovery, and state prediction, etc. However, PIML still faces many serious optimization challenges that significantly restrict its applications. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework that transforms PIML to convex optimization to overcome all these limitations, referred to as Convex-PIML. The linear combination of B-splines is utilized to approximate the data, promoting the convexity of the loss function. By replacing the non-convex components of the loss function with convex approximations, the problem is further converted into a sequence of successively refined approximated convex optimization problems. This conversion allows the use of well-established convex optimization algorithms, obtaining solutions effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, an adaptive knot optimization method based on error estimate is introduced to mitigate the spectral bias issue of PIML, further improving the performance. The proposed theoretically guaranteed framework is tested in scenarios with distinct types of physical prior. The results indicate that optimization problems are effectively solved in these scenarios, highlighting the potential of the framework for broad applications.",

    "summary": "Effectively analyzing the comments to uncover latent intentions holds immense value in making strategic decisions across various domains. However, several challenges hinder the process of sentiment analysis including the lexical diversity exhibited in comments, the presence of long dependencies within the text, encountering unknown symbols and words, and dealing with imbalanced datasets. Moreover, existing sentiment analysis tasks mostly leveraged sequential models to encode the long dependent texts and it requires longer execution time as it processes the text sequentially. In contrast, the Transformer requires less execution time due to its parallel processing nature. In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid deep learning model, RoBERTa-BiLSTM, which combines the Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. RoBERTa is utilized to generate meaningful word embedding vectors, while BiLSTM effectively captures the contextual semantics of long-dependent texts. The RoBERTa-BiLSTM hybrid model leverages the strengths of both sequential and Transformer models to enhance performance in sentiment analysis. We conducted experiments using datasets from IMDb, Twitter US Airline, and Sentiment140 to evaluate the proposed model against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the RoBERTa-BiLSTM model surpasses baseline models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa-base, RoBERTa-GRU, and RoBERTa-LSTM), achieving accuracies of 80.74%, 92.36%, and 82.25% on the Twitter US Airline, IMDb, and Sentiment140 datasets, respectively. Additionally, the model achieves F1-scores of 80.73%, 92.35%, and 82.25% on the same datasets, respectively.",

    "summary": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are localized dilatations of the abdominal aorta that can lead to life-threatening rupture if left untreated. AAAs primarily affect older individuals, with high mortality rates following rupture, so early diagnosis and risk assessment are critical. The geometrical characteristics of an AAA, such as its maximum diameter, asymmetry, and wall thickness, are extremely significant in biomechanical models for the assessment of rupture risk. Despite the growing use of computational modeling for AAA investigation, there is a notable gap in accessible, open-source software capable of generating simulation-ready geometries for biomechanical and hemodynamic simulations. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{AneuPy}, an open-source Python-based tool designed to create both idealized and patient-specific AAA geometric models. \\textbf{AneuPy} is a fast and automated approach for generating aneurysm geometries from minimal input data, allowing for extensive parameter customization. By automating the creation of simulation-ready geometries for finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), or fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models, \\textbf{AneuPy} can facilitate research in AAA and improve patient-specific risk prediction.",

In this work we present a persistent homology framework to estimate recurrence times in multi-variate time series with different generalizations of cyclic behavior (periodic, repetitive, and recurring). To this end, we provide three specialized methods within our framework that are provably stable and validate them using real-world data, including a new benchmark dataset from an injection molding machine.",

We propose an approach to exploit the Graph Convolution operation in GNNs to encode the context and use it in coalition with LSTMs to predict the next word given a local context of preceding words.

    "summary": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning for language model post-training, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have shown promise in low-resource settings. However, GRPO typically relies on solution-level and scalar reward signals that fail to capture the semantic diversity among sampled completions. This leads to what we identify as a diversity-quality inconsistency, where distinct reasoning paths may receive indistinguishable rewards. To address this limitation, we propose $\\textit{Diversity-aware Reward Adjustment}$ (DRA), a method that explicitly incorporates semantic diversity into the reward computation. DRA uses Submodular Mutual Information (SMI) to downweight redundant completions and amplify rewards for diverse ones. This encourages better exploration during learning, while maintaining stable exploitation of high-quality samples. Our method integrates seamlessly with both GRPO and its variant DR.~GRPO, resulting in $\\textit{DRA-GRPO}$ and $\\textit{DGA-DR.~GRPO}$. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks and find that it outperforms recent strong baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 58.2%, using only 7,000 fine-tuning samples and a total training cost of approximately $55.

In this preregistered, large-scale incentivized experiment, participants (quiz takers) completed an online quiz where persuaders (either humans or LLMs) attempted to persuade quiz takers toward correct or incorrect answers. We find that LLM persuaders achieved significantly higher compliance with their directional persuasion attempts than incentivized human persuaders, demonstrating superior persuasive capabilities in both truthful (toward correct answers) and deceptive (toward incorrect answers) contexts. We also find that LLM persuaders significantly increased quiz takers' accuracy, leading to higher earnings, when steering quiz takers toward correct answers, and significantly decreased their accuracy, leading to lower earnings, when steering them toward incorrect answers. Overall, our findings suggest that AI's persuasion capabilities already exceed those of humans that have real-money bonuses tied to performance. Our findings of increasingly capable AI persuaders thus underscore the urgency of emerging alignment and governance frameworks.",

However, while LLM prompts consist of both the task-agnostic system prompts and task-specific user prompts, existing work on prompt optimization has focused on user prompts specific to individual queries or tasks, and largely overlooked the system prompt that is, once optimized, applicable across different tasks and domains. Motivated by this, we introduce the novel problem of bilevel system prompt optimization, whose objective is to design system prompts that are robust to diverse user prompts and transferable to unseen tasks. To tackle this problem, we then propose a meta-learning framework, which meta-learns the system prompt by optimizing it over various user prompts across multiple datasets, while simultaneously updating the user prompts in an iterative manner to ensure synergy between them. We conduct experiments on 14 unseen datasets spanning 5 different domains, on which we show that our approach produces system prompts that generalize effectively to diverse user prompts. Also, our findings reveal that the optimized system prompt enables rapid adaptation even to unseen tasks, requiring fewer optimization steps for test-time user prompts while achieving improved performance.",

In this paper, we introduce VeriFact, a factuality evaluation framework designed to enhance fact extraction by identifying and resolving incomplete and missing facts to support more accurate verification results. Moreover, we introduce FactRBench , a benchmark that evaluates both precision and recall in long-form model responses, whereas prior work primarily focuses on precision. FactRBench provides reference fact sets from advanced LLMs and human-written answers, enabling recall assessment. Empirical evaluations show that VeriFact significantly enhances fact completeness and preserves complex facts with critical relational information, resulting in more accurate factuality evaluation. Benchmarking various open- and close-weight LLMs on FactRBench indicate that larger models within same model family improve precision and recall, but high precision does not always correlate with high recall, underscoring the importance of comprehensive factuality assessment.",

    "summary": "Pretrained language models (LLMs) are often constrained by their fixed tokenization schemes, leading to inefficiencies and performance limitations, particularly for multilingual or specialized applications. This tokenizer lock-in presents significant challenges. standard methods to overcome this often require prohibitive computational resources. Although tokenizer replacement with heuristic initialization aims to reduce this burden, existing methods often require exhaustive residual fine-tuning and still may not fully preserve semantic nuances or adequately address the underlying compression inefficiencies. Our framework introduces two innovations: first, Tokenadapt, a model-agnostic tokenizer transplantation method, and second, novel pre-tokenization learning for multi-word Supertokens to enhance compression and reduce fragmentation. Tokenadapt initializes new unique token embeddings via a hybrid heuristic that combines two methods: a local estimate based on subword decomposition using the old tokenizer, and a global estimate utilizing the top-k semantically similar tokens from the original vocabulary. This methodology aims to preserve semantics while significantly minimizing retraining requirements. Empirical investigations validate both contributions: the transplantation heuristic successfully initializes unique tokens, markedly outperforming conventional baselines and sophisticated methods including Transtokenizer and ReTok, while our Supertokens achieve notable compression gains. Our zero-shot perplexity results demonstrate that the TokenAdapt hybrid initialization consistently yields lower perplexity ratios compared to both ReTok and TransTokenizer baselines across different base models and newly trained target tokenizers. TokenAdapt typically reduced the overall perplexity ratio significantly compared to ReTok, yielding at least a 2-fold improvement in these aggregate scores.",

    "summary": "Research projects, including those focused on cancer, rely on the manual extraction of information from clinical reports. This process is time-consuming and prone to errors, limiting the efficiency of data-driven approaches in healthcare. To address these challenges, Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers an alternative for automating the extraction of relevant data from electronic health records (EHRs). In this study, we focus on lung and breast cancer due to their high incidence and the significant impact they have on public health. Early detection and effective data management in both types of cancer are crucial for improving patient outcomes. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of data extraction, we utilized GMV's NLP tool uQuery, which excels at identifying relevant entities in clinical texts and converting them into standardized formats such as SNOMED and OMOP. uQuery not only detects and classifies entities but also associates them with contextual information, including negated entities, temporal aspects, and patient-related details. In this work, we explore the use of NLP techniques, specifically Named Entity Recognition (NER), to automatically identify and extract key clinical information from EHRs related to these two cancers. A dataset from Health Research Institute Hospital La Fe (IIS La Fe), comprising 200 annotated breast cancer and 400 lung cancer reports, was used, with eight clinical entities manually labeled using the Doccano platform. To perform NER, we fine-tuned the bsc-bio-ehr-en3 model, a RoBERTa-based biomedical linguistic model pre-trained in Spanish. Fine-tuning was performed using the Transformers architecture, enabling accurate recognition of clinical entities in these cancer types. Our results demonstrate strong overall performance, particularly in identifying entities like MET and PAT, although challenges remain with less frequent entities like EVOL.",

It has been demonstrated that linear probes trained on a single hidden state of the model already generalize across a range of topics and might even be used for lie detection in LLM conversations. In this work we explore how this truth direction generalizes between various conversational formats. We find good generalization between short conversations that end on a lie, but poor generalization to longer formats where the lie appears earlier in the input prompt. We propose a solution that significantly improves this type of generalization by adding a fixed key phrase at the end of each conversation.

    "summary": "Each year, tens of millions of essays are written and graded in college-level English courses. Students are asked to analyze literary and cultural texts through a process known as close reading, in which they gather textual details to formulate evidence-based arguments. Despite being viewed as a basis for critical thinking and widely adopted as a required element of university coursework, close reading has never been evaluated on large language models (LLMs), and multi-discipline benchmarks like MMLU do not include literature as a subject. To fill this gap, we present KRISTEVA, the first close reading benchmark for evaluating interpretive reasoning, consisting of 1331 multiple-choice questions adapted from classroom data. With KRISTEVA, we propose three progressively more difficult sets of tasks to approximate different elements of the close reading process, which we use to test how well LLMs may seem to understand and reason about literary works: 1) extracting stylistic features, 2) retrieving relevant contextual information from parametric knowledge, and 3) multi-hop reasoning between style and external contexts. Our baseline results find that, while state-of-the-art LLMs possess some college-level close reading competency (accuracy 49.7% - 69.7%), their performances still trail those of experienced human evaluators on 10 out of our 11 tasks.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across natural language tasks, but their ability to forecast violent conflict remains underexplored. We investigate whether LLMs possess meaningful parametric knowledge-encoded in their pretrained weights-to predict conflict escalation and fatalities without external data. This is critical for early warning systems, humanitarian planning, and policy-making. We compare this parametric knowledge with non-parametric capabilities, where LLMs access structured and unstructured context from conflict datasets (e.g., ACLED, GDELT) and recent news reports via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Incorporating external information could enhance model performance by providing up-to-date context otherwise missing from pretrained weights. Our two-part evaluation framework spans 2020-2024 across conflict-prone regions in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. In the parametric setting, LLMs predict conflict trends and fatalities relying only on pretrained knowledge. In the non-parametric setting, models receive summaries of recent conflict events, indicators, and geopolitical developments. We compare predicted conflict trend labels (e.g., Escalate, Stable Conflict, De-escalate, Peace) and fatalities against historical data. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs for conflict forecasting and the benefits of augmenting them with structured external knowledge.",

    "summary": "Large language models are, by definition, based on language. In an effort to underscore the critical need for regional localized models, this paper examines primary differences between variants of written Spanish across Latin America and Spain, with an in-depth sociocultural and linguistic contextualization therein. We argue that these differences effectively constitute significant gaps in the quotidian use of Spanish among dialectal groups by creating sociolinguistic dissonances, to the extent that locale-sensitive AI models would play a pivotal role in bridging these divides. In doing so, this approach informs better and more efficient localization strategies that also serve to more adequately meet inclusivity goals, while securing sustainable active daily user growth in a major low-risk investment geographic area. Therefore, implementing at least the proposed five sub variants of Spanish addresses two lines of action: to foment user trust and reliance on AI language models while also demonstrating a level of cultural, historical, and sociolinguistic awareness that reflects positively on any internationalization strategy.",

    "summary": "The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened concerns about the misuse of AI-generated text, making watermarking a promising solution. Mainstream watermarking schemes for LLMs fall into two categories: logits-based and sampling-based. However, current schemes entail trade-offs among robustness, text quality, and security. To mitigate this, we integrate logits-based and sampling-based schemes, harnessing their respective strengths to achieve synergy. In this paper, we propose a versatile symbiotic watermarking framework with three strategies: serial, parallel, and hybrid. The hybrid framework adaptively embeds watermarks using token entropy and semantic entropy, optimizing the balance between detectability, robustness, text quality, and security. Furthermore, we validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We believe this framework provides novel insights into diverse watermarking paradigms. Our code is available at \\href{this https URL}{this https URL}.",

    "summary": "Prompt optimization (PO) offers a practical alternative to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), enabling performance improvements without altering model weights. Existing methods typically rely on advanced, large-scale LLMs like GPT-4 to generate optimized prompts. However, due to limited downward compatibility, verbose, instruction-heavy prompts from advanced LLMs can overwhelm lightweight inference models and degrade response quality. In this work, we rethink prompt optimization through the lens of interpretable design. We first identify a set of model-agnostic prompt quality merits and empirically validate their effectiveness in enhancing prompt and response quality. We then introduce MePO, a merit-guided, lightweight, and locally deployable prompt optimizer trained on our preference dataset built from merit-aligned prompts generated by a lightweight LLM. Unlike prior work, MePO avoids online optimization reliance, reduces cost and privacy concerns, and, by learning clear, interpretable merits, generalizes effectively to both large-scale and lightweight inference models. Experiments demonstrate that MePO achieves better results across diverse tasks and model types, offering a scalable and robust solution for real-world deployment.

    "summary": "The advent of large language models (LLMs) has allowed numerous applications, including the generation of queried responses, to be leveraged in chatbots and other conversational assistants. Being trained on a plethora of data, LLMs often undergo high levels of over-fitting, resulting in the generation of extra and incorrect data, thus causing hallucinations in output generation. One of the root causes of such problems is the lack of timely, factual, and personalized information fed to the LLM. In this paper, we propose an approach to address these problems by introducing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist the LLM in personalized response generation tailored to the users. KGs have the advantage of storing continuously updated factual information in a structured way. While our KGs can be used for a variety of frequently updated personal data, such as calendar, contact, and location data, we focus on calendar data in this paper. Our experimental results show that our approach works significantly better in understanding personal information and generating accurate responses compared to the baseline LLMs using personal data as text inputs, with a moderate reduction in response time.",

    "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) have risen in prominence over the past few years, there has been concern over the potential biases in LLMs inherited from the training data. Previous studies have examined how LLMs exhibit implicit bias, such as when response generation changes when different social contexts are introduced. We argue that this implicit bias is not only an ethical, but also a technical issue, as it reveals an inability of LLMs to accommodate extraneous information. However, unlike other measures of LLM intelligence, there are no standard methods to benchmark this specific subset of LLM bias. To bridge this gap, we developed a method for calculating an easily interpretable benchmark, DIF (Demographic Implicit Fairness), by evaluating preexisting LLM logic and math problem datasets with sociodemographic personas. We demonstrate that this method can statistically validate the presence of implicit bias in LLM behavior and find an inverse trend between question answering accuracy and implicit bias, supporting our argument.",

However, they still face challenges in balancing retrieval precision and recall, impacting their efficacy in answering questions. To address this, we introduce $\\textbf{CAFE}$, a two-stage coarse-to-fine method to enhance multi-document question-answering capacities. By gradually eliminating the negative impacts of background and distracting documents, CAFE makes the responses more reliant on the evidence documents. Initially, a coarse-grained filtering method leverages retrieval heads to identify and rank relevant documents. Then, a fine-grained steering method guides attention to the most relevant content. Experiments across benchmarks show CAFE outperforms baselines, achieving up to 22.1% and 13.7% SubEM improvement over SFT and RAG methods on the Mistral model, respectively.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly reshape modern life, advancing fields from healthcare to education and beyond. However, alongside their remarkable capabilities lies a significant threat: the susceptibility of these models to jailbreaking. The fundamental vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks stems from the very data they learn from. As long as this training data includes unfiltered, problematic, or 'dark' content, the models can inherently learn undesirable patterns or weaknesses that allow users to circumvent their intended safety controls. Our research identifies the growing threat posed by dark LLMs models deliberately designed without ethical guardrails or modified through jailbreak techniques. In our research, we uncovered a universal jailbreak attack that effectively compromises multiple state-of-the-art models, enabling them to answer almost any question and produce harmful outputs upon request. The main idea of our attack was published online over seven months ago. However, many of the tested LLMs were still vulnerable to this attack. Despite our responsible disclosure efforts, responses from major LLM providers were often inadequate, highlighting a concerning gap in industry practices regarding AI safety. As model training becomes more accessible and cheaper, and as open-source LLMs proliferate, the risk of widespread misuse escalates. Without decisive intervention, LLMs may continue democratizing access to dangerous knowledge, posing greater risks than anticipated.",

This paper presents the first systematic investigation into probing PLMs for linguistic knowledge about African languages. We train layer-wise probes for six typologically diverse African languages to analyse how linguistic features are distributed. We also design control tasks, a way to interpret probe performance, for the MasakhaPOS dataset. We find PLMs adapted for African languages to encode more linguistic information about target languages than massively multilingual PLMs. Our results reaffirm previous findings that token-level syntactic information concentrates in middle-to-last layers, while sentence-level semantic information is distributed across all layers. Through control tasks and probing baselines, we confirm that performance reflects the internal knowledge of PLMs rather than probe memorisation. Our study applies established interpretability techniques to African-language PLMs. In doing so, we highlight the internal mechanisms underlying the success of strategies like active learning and multilingual adaptation.",

It covers the real-world scenarios of monolingual and multilingual retrieval, and provides relevancy annotations for each retrieved document. Our novel dataset construction pipeline results in questions that require complex reasoning, as evidenced by the significant gap between human and LLM performance. Consequently, XRAG serves as a valuable benchmark for studying LLM reasoning abilities, even before considering the additional cross-lingual complexity. Experimental results on five LLMs uncover two previously unreported challenges in cross-lingual RAG: 1) in the monolingual retrieval setting, all evaluated models struggle with response language correctness; 2) in the multilingual retrieval setting, the main challenge lies in reasoning over retrieved information across languages rather than generation of non-English text.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models are now key assistants in human decision-making processes. However, a common note always seems to follow: \"LLMs can make mistakes. Be careful with important info.\" This points to the reality that not all outputs from LLMs are dependable, and users must evaluate them manually. The challenge deepens as hallucinated responses, often presented with seemingly plausible explanations, create complications and raise trust issues among users. To tackle such issue, this paper proposes GE-Chat, a knowledge Graph enhanced retrieval-augmented generation framework to provide Evidence-based response generation. Specifically, when the user uploads a material document, a knowledge graph will be created, which helps construct a retrieval-augmented agent, enhancing the agent's responses with additional knowledge beyond its training corpus. Then we leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic generation, n-hop sub-graph searching, and entailment-based sentence generation to realize accurate evidence retrieval. We demonstrate that our method improves the existing models' performance in terms of identifying the exact evidence in a free-form context, providing a reliable way to examine the resources of LLM's conclusion and help with the judgment of the trustworthiness.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. However, when training reasoning models, these approaches are primarily applicable to specific domains such as mathematics and programming, which imposes fundamental constraints on the breadth and scalability of training data. In contrast, continual pretraining (CPT) offers the advantage of not requiring task-specific signals. Nevertheless, how to effectively synthesize training data for reasoning and how such data affect a wide range of domains remain largely unexplored. This study provides a detailed evaluation of Reasoning CPT, a form of CPT that uses synthetic data to reconstruct the hidden thought processes underlying texts, based on the premise that texts are the result of the author's thinking process. Specifically, we apply Reasoning CPT to Gemma2-9B using synthetic data with hidden thoughts derived from STEM and Law corpora, and compare it to standard CPT on the MMLU benchmark. Our analysis reveals that Reasoning CPT consistently improves performance across all evaluated domains. Notably, reasoning skills acquired in one domain transfer effectively to others; the performance gap with conventional methods widens as problem difficulty increases, with gains of up to 8 points on the most challenging problems. Furthermore, models trained with hidden thoughts learn to adjust the depth of their reasoning according to problem difficulty.",

    "summary": "Long chain-of-thought (CoT) is an essential ingredient in effective usage of modern large language models, but our understanding of the reasoning strategies underlying these capabilities remains limited. While some prior works have attempted to categorize CoTs using predefined strategy types, such approaches are constrained by human intuition and fail to capture the full diversity of model behaviors. In this work, we introduce the CoT Encyclopedia, a bottom-up framework for analyzing and steering model reasoning. Our method automatically extracts diverse reasoning criteria from model-generated CoTs, embeds them into a semantic space, clusters them into representative categories, and derives contrastive rubrics to interpret reasoning behavior. Human evaluations show that this framework produces more interpretable and comprehensive analyses than existing methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that this understanding enables performance gains: we can predict which strategy a model is likely to use and guide it toward more effective alternatives. Finally, we provide practical insights, such as that training data format (e.g., free-form vs. multiple-choice) has a far greater impact on reasoning behavior than data domain, underscoring the importance of format-aware model design.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success but face significant computational and memory challenges, particularly due to their extensive output vocabularies. The final linear projection layer, mapping hidden states to vocabulary-sized logits, often constitutes a substantial portion of the model's parameters and computational cost during inference. Existing methods like adaptive softmax or hierarchical softmax introduce structural complexities. In this paper, we propose VQ-Logits, a novel approach that leverages Vector Quantization (VQ) to drastically reduce the parameter count and computational load of the LLM output layer. VQ-Logits replaces the large V * dmodel output embedding matrix with a small, shared codebook of K embedding vectors (K << V ). Each token in the vocabulary is mapped to one of these K codebook vectors. The LLM predicts logits over this compact codebook, which are then efficiently \"scattered\" to the full vocabulary space using the learned or preassigned mapping. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on standard language modeling benchmarks (e.g., WikiText-103, C4) that VQ-Logits can achieve up to 99% parameter reduction in the output layer and 6x speedup in logit computation, with only a marginal 4% increase in perplexity compared to full softmax baselines. We further provide detailed ablation studies on codebook size, initialization, and learning strategies, showcasing the robustness and effectiveness of our approach.",

    "summary": "Role-playing conversational agents (RPCAs) face persistent challenges in maintaining role consistency. To address this, we propose RAIDEN-R1, a novel reinforcement learning framework that integrates Verifiable Role-Awareness Reward (VRAR). The method introduces both singular and multi-term mining strategies to generate quantifiable rewards by assessing role-specific keys. Additionally, we construct a high-quality, role-aware Chain-of-Thought dataset through multi-LLM collaboration, and implement experiments to enhance reasoning coherence. Experiments on the RAIDEN benchmark demonstrate RAIDEN-R1's superiority: our 14B-GRPO model achieves 88.04% and 88.65% accuracy on Script-Based Knowledge and Conversation Memory metrics, respectively, outperforming baseline models while maintaining robustness. Case analyses further reveal the model's enhanced ability to resolve conflicting contextual cues and sustain first-person narrative consistency.

Specifically, the focus is on the binary classification task of identifying references to human rights violations within the dataset.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of these models, their annotations are compared against a gold standard set of human double-annotated labels across 1000 samples. The analysis includes assessing annotation performance under different prompting conditions, with prompts provided in both English and Russian. Additionally, the study explores the unique patterns of errors and disagreements exhibited by each model, offering insights into their strengths, limitations, and cross-linguistic adaptability.\nBy juxtaposing LLM outputs with human annotations, this research contributes to understanding the reliability and applicability of LLMs for sensitive, domain-specific tasks in multilingual contexts. It also sheds light on how language models handle inherently subjective and context-dependent judgments, a critical consideration for their deployment in real-world scenarios.",

    "summary": "Clinical evidence, derived from rigorous research and data analysis, provides healthcare professionals with reliable scientific foundations for informed decision-making. Integrating clinical evidence into real-time practice is challenging due to the enormous workload, complex professional processes, and time constraints. This highlights the need for tools that automate evidence synthesis to support more efficient and accurate decision making in clinical settings. This study introduces Quicker, an evidence-based clinical decision support system powered by large language models (LLMs), designed to automate evidence synthesis and generate clinical recommendations modeled after standard clinical guideline development processes. Quicker implements a fully automated chain that covers all phases, from questions to clinical recommendations, and further enables customized decision-making through integrated tools and interactive user interfaces. To evaluate Quicker's capabilities, we developed the Q2CRBench-3 benchmark dataset, based on clinical guideline development records for three different diseases. Experimental results highlighted Quicker's strong performance, with fine-grained question decomposition tailored to user preferences, retrieval sensitivities comparable to human experts, and literature screening performance approaching comprehensive inclusion of relevant studies. In addition, Quicker-assisted evidence assessment effectively supported human reviewers, while Quicker's recommendations were more comprehensive and logically coherent than those of clinicians. In system-level testing, collaboration between a single reviewer and Quicker reduced the time required for recommendation development to 20-40 minutes. In general, our findings affirm the potential of Quicker to help physicians make quicker and more reliable evidence-based clinical decisions.",

Improved judgment ability is enabled by stronger chain-of-thought reasoning, motivating the need to find the best recipes for training such models to think. In this work we introduce J1, a reinforcement learning approach to training such models. Our method converts both verifiable and non-verifiable prompts to judgment tasks with verifiable rewards that incentivize thinking and mitigate judgment bias. In particular, our approach outperforms all other existing 8B or 70B models when trained at those sizes, including models distilled from DeepSeek-R1. J1 also outperforms o1-mini, and even R1 on some benchmarks, despite training a smaller model. We provide analysis and ablations comparing Pairwise-J1 vs Pointwise-J1 models, offline vs online training recipes, reward strategies, seed prompts, and variations in thought length and content. We find that our models make better judgments by learning to outline evaluation criteria, comparing against self-generated reference answers, and re-evaluating the correctness of model responses.",

    "summary": "Semantic text representation is a fundamental task in the field of natural language processing. Existing text embedding (e.g., SimCSE and LLM2Vec) have demonstrated excellent performance, but the values of each dimension are difficult to trace and interpret. Bag-of-words, as classic sparse interpretable embeddings, suffers from poor performance. Recently, Benara et al. (2024) propose interpretable text embeddings using large language models, which forms \"0/1\" embeddings based on responses to a series of questions. These interpretable text embeddings are typically high-dimensional (larger than 10,000). In this work, we propose Low-dimensional (lower than 500) Dense and Interpretable text embeddings with Relative representations (LDIR). The numerical values of its dimensions indicate semantic relatedness to different anchor texts through farthest point sampling, offering both semantic representation as well as a certain level of traceability and interpretability. We validate LDIR on multiple semantic textual similarity, retrieval, and clustering tasks. Extensive experimental results show that LDIR performs close to the black-box baseline models and outperforms the interpretable embeddings baselines with much fewer dimensions.

Our approach leverages visual-language models (VLMs), using modality-specific experts to jointly interpret information across modalities. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art systems while remaining adaptable and extensible.

    "summary": "With the advent of neural language models, the performance of code generation has been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions, thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the best-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of generated code.",

    "summary": "Plain language summaries (PLSs) are essential for facilitating effective communication between clinicians and patients by making complex medical information easier for laypeople to understand and act upon. Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in automating PLS generation, but their effectiveness in supporting health information comprehension remains unclear. Prior evaluations have generally relied on automated scores that do not measure understandability directly, or subjective Likert-scale ratings from convenience samples with limited generalizability. To address these gaps, we conducted a large-scale crowdsourced evaluation of LLM-generated PLSs using Amazon Mechanical Turk with 150 participants. We assessed PLS quality through subjective Likert-scale ratings focusing on simplicity, informativeness, coherence, and faithfulness; and objective multiple-choice comprehension and recall measures of reader understanding. Additionally, we examined the alignment between 10 automated evaluation metrics and human judgments. Our findings indicate that while LLMs can generate PLSs that appear indistinguishable from human-written ones in subjective evaluations, human-written PLSs lead to significantly better comprehension. Furthermore, automated evaluation metrics fail to reflect human judgment, calling into question their suitability for evaluating PLSs. This is the first study to systematically evaluate LLM-generated PLSs based on both reader preferences and comprehension outcomes. Our findings highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that move beyond surface-level quality and for generation methods that explicitly optimize for layperson comprehension.",

    "summary": "We introduce the \\emph{Diffusion Chain of Lateral Thought (DCoLT)}, a reasoning framework for diffusion language models. DCoLT treats each intermediate step in the reverse diffusion process as a latent \"thinking\" action and optimizes the entire reasoning trajectory to maximize the reward on the correctness of the final answer with outcome-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unlike traditional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods that follow a causal, linear thinking process, DCoLT allows bidirectional, non-linear reasoning with no strict rule on grammatical correctness amid its intermediate steps of thought. We implement DCoLT on two representative Diffusion Language Models (DLMs). First, we choose SEDD as a representative continuous-time discrete diffusion model, where its concrete score derives a probabilistic policy to maximize the RL reward over the entire sequence of intermediate diffusion steps. We further consider the discrete-time masked diffusion language model -- LLaDA, and find that the order to predict and unmask tokens plays an essential role to optimize its RL action resulting from the ranking-based Unmasking Policy Module (UPM) defined by the Plackett-Luce model. Experiments on both math and code generation tasks show that using only public data and 16 H800 GPUs, DCoLT-reinforced DLMs outperform other DLMs trained by SFT or RL or even both. Notably, DCoLT-reinforced LLaDA boosts its reasoning accuracy by +9.8%, +5.7%, +11.4%, +19.5% on GSM8K, MATH, MBPP, and HumanEval.",

    "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an effective method to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing methods focus on optimizing the retriever or generator in the RAG system by directly utilizing the top-k retrieved documents. However, the documents effectiveness are various significantly across user queries, i.e. some documents provide valuable knowledge while others totally lack critical information. It hinders the retriever and generator's adaptation during training. Inspired by human cognitive learning, curriculum learning trains models using samples progressing from easy to difficult, thus enhancing their generalization ability, and we integrate this effective paradigm to the training of the RAG system. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage Curriculum Learning based RAG system training framework, named CL-RAG. We first construct training data with multiple difficulty levels for the retriever and generator separately through sample evolution. Then, we train the model in stages based on the curriculum learning approach, thereby optimizing the overall performance and generalization of the RAG system more effectively. Our CL-RAG framework demonstrates consistent effectiveness across four open-domain QA datasets, achieving performance gains of 2% to 4% over multiple advanced methods.",

    "summary": "Code security and usability are both essential for various coding assistant applications driven by large language models (LLMs). Current code security benchmarks focus solely on single evaluation task and paradigm, such as code completion and generation, lacking comprehensive assessment across dimensions like secure code generation, vulnerability repair and discrimination. In this paper, we first propose CoV-Eval, a multi-task benchmark covering various tasks such as code completion, vulnerability repair, vulnerability detection and classification, for comprehensive evaluation of LLM code security. Besides, we developed VC-Judge, an improved judgment model that aligns closely with human experts and can review LLM-generated programs for vulnerabilities in a more efficient and reliable way. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 proprietary and open-source LLMs. Overall, while most LLMs identify vulnerable codes well, they still tend to generate insecure codes and struggle with recognizing specific vulnerability types and performing repairs. Extensive experiments and qualitative analyses reveal key challenges and optimization directions, offering insights for future research in LLM code security.",

    "summary": "Translation-based strategies for cross-lingual transfer XLT such as translate-train -- training on noisy target language data translated from the source language -- and translate-test -- evaluating on noisy source language data translated from the target language -- are competitive XLT baselines. In XLT for token classification tasks, however, these strategies include label projection, the challenging step of mapping the labels from each token in the original sentence to its counterpart(s) in the translation. Although word aligners (WAs) are commonly used for label projection, the low-level design decisions for applying them to translation-based XLT have not been systematically investigated. Moreover, recent marker-based methods, which project labeled spans by inserting tags around them before (or after) translation, claim to outperform WAs in label projection for XLT. In this work, we revisit WAs for label projection, systematically investigating the effects of low-level design decisions on token-level XLT: (i) the algorithm for projecting labels between (multi-)token spans, (ii) filtering strategies to reduce the number of noisily mapped labels, and (iii) the pre-tokenization of the translated sentences. We find that all of these substantially impact translation-based XLT performance and show that, with optimized choices, XLT with WA offers performance at least comparable to that of marker-based methods. We then introduce a new projection strategy that ensembles translate-train and translate-test predictions and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms the marker-based projection. Crucially, we show that our proposed ensembling also reduces sensitivity to low-level WA design choices, resulting in more robust XLT for token classification tasks.",

    "summary": "Multi-token prediction has emerged as a promising objective for improving language model pretraining, but its benefits have not consistently generalized to other settings such as fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose MuToR, a simple and effective approach to multi-token prediction that interleaves learnable register tokens into the input sequence, each tasked with predicting future targets. Compared to existing methods, MuToR offers several key advantages: it introduces only a negligible number of additional parameters, requires no architectural changes--ensuring compatibility with off-the-shelf pretrained language models--and remains aligned with the next-token pretraining objective, making it especially well-suited for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover, it naturally supports scalable prediction horizons. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of MuToR across a range of use cases, including supervised fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and pretraining, on challenging generative tasks in both language and vision domains.

    "summary": "Motivated by scaling laws in language modeling that demonstrate how test loss scales as a power law with model and dataset sizes, we find that similar laws exist in preference modeling. We propose World Preference Modeling$ (WorldPM) to emphasize this scaling potential, where World Preference embodies a unified representation of human preferences. In this paper, we collect preference data from public forums covering diverse user communities, and conduct extensive training using 15M-scale data across models ranging from 1.5B to 72B parameters. We observe distinct patterns across different evaluation metrics: (1) Adversarial metrics (ability to identify deceptive features) consistently scale up with increased training data and base model size; (2) Objective metrics (objective knowledge with well-defined answers) show emergent behavior in larger language models, highlighting WorldPM's scalability potential; (3) Subjective metrics (subjective preferences from a limited number of humans or AI) do not demonstrate scaling trends. Further experiments validate the effectiveness of WorldPM as a foundation for preference fine-tuning. Through evaluations on 7 benchmarks with 20 subtasks, we find that WorldPM broadly improves the generalization performance across human preference datasets of varying sizes (7K, 100K and 800K samples), with performance gains exceeding 5% on many key subtasks. Integrating WorldPM into our internal RLHF pipeline, we observe significant improvements on both in-house and public evaluation sets, with notable gains of 4% to 8% in our in-house evaluations.",

    "summary": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) already possess a latent capacity for long chain-of-thought reasoning. Prior work has shown that outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) can incidentally elicit advanced reasoning behaviors such as self-correction, backtracking, and verification phenomena often referred to as the model's \"aha moment\". However, the timing and consistency of these emergent behaviors remain unpredictable and uncontrollable, limiting the scalability and reliability of LRMs' reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we move beyond reliance on prompts and coincidental \"aha moments\". Instead, we explicitly align models with three meta-abilities: deduction, induction, and abduction, using automatically generated, self-verifiable tasks. Our three stage-pipeline individual alignment, parameter-space merging, and domain-specific reinforcement learning, boosting performance by over 10\\% relative to instruction-tuned baselines. Furthermore, domain-specific RL from the aligned checkpoint yields an additional 2\\% average gain in the performance ceiling across math, coding, and science benchmarks, demonstrating that explicit meta-ability alignment offers a scalable and dependable foundation for reasoning.

    "summary": "Wildfires have become increasingly frequent, irregular, and severe in recent years. Understanding how affected populations perceive and respond during wildfire crises is critical for timely and empathetic disaster response. Social media platforms offer a crowd-sourced channel to capture evolving public discourse, providing hyperlocal information and insight into public sentiment. This study analyzes Reddit discourse during the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires, spanning from the onset of the disaster to full containment. We collect 385 posts and 114,879 comments related to the Palisades and Eaton fires. We adopt topic modeling methods to identify the latent topics, enhanced by large language models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop (HITL) refinement. Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical framework to categorize latent topics, consisting of two main categories, Situational Awareness (SA) and Crisis Narratives (CN). The volume of SA category closely aligns with real-world fire progressions, peaking within the first 2-5 days as the fires reach the maximum extent. The most frequent co-occurring category set of public health and safety, loss and damage, and emergency resources expands on a wide range of health-related latent topics, including environmental health, occupational health, and one health. Grief signals and mental health risks consistently accounted for 60 percentage and 40 percentage of CN instances, respectively, with the highest total volume occurring at night. This study contributes the first annotated social media dataset on the 2025 LA fires, and introduces a scalable multi-layer framework that leverages topic modeling for crisis discourse analysis. By identifying persistent public health concerns, our results can inform more empathetic and adaptive strategies for disaster response, public health communication, and future research in comparable climate-related disaster events.",

    "summary": "Transformer models learn in two distinct modes: in-weights learning (IWL), encoding knowledge into model weights, and in-context learning (ICL), adapting flexibly to context without weight modification. To better understand the interplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary biology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL, adapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and phenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to environmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability dictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic encoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We experimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and systematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in Transformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high environmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp transition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL efficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics reveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift occurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we demonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL acquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding to ICL dominance. These findings support a relative-cost hypothesis for explaining these learning mode transitions, establishing predictability as a critical factor governing adaptive strategies in Transformers, and offering novel insights for understanding ICL and guiding training methodologies.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate or automate human behavior in complex sequential decision-making tasks. A natural question is then whether LLMs exhibit similar decision-making behavior to humans, and can achieve comparable (or superior) performance. In this work, we focus on the exploration-exploitation (E&E) tradeoff, a fundamental aspect of dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. We employ canonical multi-armed bandit (MAB) tasks introduced in the cognitive science and psychiatry literature to conduct a comparative study of the E&E strategies of LLMs, humans, and MAB algorithms. We use interpretable choice models to capture the E&E strategies of the agents and investigate how explicit reasoning, through both prompting strategies and reasoning-enhanced models, shapes LLM decision-making. We find that reasoning shifts LLMs toward more human-like behavior, characterized by a mix of random and directed exploration. In simple stationary tasks, reasoning-enabled LLMs exhibit similar levels of random and directed exploration compared to humans. However, in more complex, non-stationary environments, LLMs struggle to match human adaptability, particularly in effective directed exploration, despite achieving similar regret in certain scenarios. Our findings highlight both the promise and limits of LLMs as simulators of human behavior and tools for automated decision-making and point to potential areas of improvements.",

Existing methods to evaluate privacy leakage in LLMs often use memorized prefixes or simple instructions to extract data, both of which well-alignment models can easily block. Meanwhile, Jailbreak attacks bypass LLM safety mechanisms to generate harmful content, but their role in privacy scenarios remains underexplored. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks in extracting sensitive information, bridging privacy leakage and jailbreak attacks in LLMs. Moreover, we propose PIG, a novel framework targeting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and addressing the limitations of current jailbreak methods. Specifically, PIG identifies PII entities and their types in privacy queries, uses in-context learning to build a privacy context, and iteratively updates it with three gradient-based strategies to elicit target PII. We evaluate PIG and existing jailbreak methods using two privacy-related datasets. Experiments on four white-box and two black-box LLMs show that PIG outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results. The results underscore significant privacy risks in LLMs, emphasizing the need for stronger safeguards. Our code is availble at \\href{this https URL}{this https URL}.",

    "summary": "Understanding the factors contributing to traffic crashes and developing strategies to mitigate their severity is essential. Traditional statistical methods and machine learning models often struggle to capture the complex interactions between various factors and the unique characteristics of each crash. This research leverages large language model (LLM) to analyze freeway crash data and provide crash causation analysis accordingly. By compiling 226 traffic safety studies related to freeway crashes, a training dataset encompassing environmental, driver, traffic, and geometric design factors was created. The Llama3 8B model was fine-tuned using QLoRA to enhance its understanding of freeway crashes and their contributing factors, as covered in these studies. The fine-tuned Llama3 8B model was then used to identify crash causation without pre-labeled data through zero-shot classification, providing comprehensive explanations to ensure that the identified causes were reasonable and aligned with existing research. Results demonstrate that LLMs effectively identify primary crash causes such as alcohol-impaired driving, speeding, aggressive driving, and driver inattention. Incorporating event data, such as road maintenance, offers more profound insights. The model's practical applicability and potential to improve traffic safety measures were validated by a high level of agreement among researchers in the field of traffic safety, as reflected in questionnaire results with 88.89%. This research highlights the complex nature of traffic crashes and how LLMs can be used for comprehensive analysis of crash causation and other contributing factors. Moreover, it provides valuable insights and potential countermeasures to aid planners and policymakers in developing more effective and efficient traffic safety practices.",

This study responds to the growing need to systematically revisit and reorganize decades of Taiwan based CS scholarship by proposing an AI assisted approach that transforms unstructured academic texts into structured, interactive knowledge representations. We apply generative AI (GAI) techniques and large language models (LLMs) to extract and standardize entity relation triples from 1,367 peer reviewed CS articles published between 1996 and 2019. These triples are then visualized through a lightweight this http URL based system, forming the foundation of a domain specific knowledge graph and vector database for the field. This infrastructure allows users to explore conceptual nodes and semantic relationships across the corpus, revealing previously uncharted intellectual trajectories, thematic clusters, and research gaps. By decomposing textual content into graph structured knowledge units, our system enables a paradigm shift from linear text consumption to network based knowledge navigation.

    "summary": "In cloud services, virtual machine (VM) scheduling is a typical Online Dynamic Multidimensional Bin Packing (ODMBP) problem, characterized by large-scale complexity and fluctuating demands. Traditional optimization methods struggle to adapt to real-time changes, domain-expert-designed heuristic approaches suffer from rigid strategies, and existing learning-based methods often lack generalizability and interpretability. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hierarchical language agent framework named MiCo, which provides a large language model (LLM)-driven heuristic design paradigm for solving ODMBP. Specifically, ODMBP is formulated as a Semi-Markov Decision Process with Options (SMDP-Option), enabling dynamic scheduling through a two-stage architecture, i.e., Option Miner and Option Composer. Option Miner utilizes LLMs to discover diverse and useful non-context-aware strategies by interacting with constructed environments. Option Composer employs LLMs to discover a composing strategy that integrates the non-context-aware strategies with the contextual ones. Extensive experiments on real-world enterprise datasets demonstrate that MiCo achieves a 96.9\\% competitive ratio in large-scale scenarios involving more than 10,000 virtual machines. It maintains high performance even under nonstationary request flows and diverse configurations, thus validating its effectiveness in complex and large-scale cloud environments.",

    "summary": "Existing visual token pruning methods target prompt alignment and visual preservation with static strategies, overlooking the varying relative importance of these objectives across tasks, which leads to inconsistent performance. To address this, we derive the first closed-form error bound for visual token pruning based on the Hausdorff distance, uniformly characterizing the contributions of both objectives. Moreover, leveraging $\\epsilon$-covering theory, we reveal an intrinsic trade-off between these objectives and quantify their optimal attainment levels under a fixed budget. To practically handle this trade-off, we propose Multi-Objective Balanced Covering (MoB), which reformulates visual token pruning as a bi-objective covering problem. In this framework, the attainment trade-off reduces to budget allocation via greedy radius trading. MoB offers a provable performance bound and linear scalability with respect to the number of input visual tokens, enabling adaptation to challenging pruning scenarios. Extensive experiments show that MoB preserves 96.4% of performance for LLaVA-1.5-7B using only 11.1% of the original visual tokens and accelerates LLaVA-Next-7B by 1.3-1.5$\\times$ with negligible performance loss. Additionally, evaluations on Qwen2-VL and Video-LLaVA confirm that MoB integrates seamlessly into advanced MLLMs and diverse vision-language tasks.",

    "summary": "Transformer models rely on self-attention to capture token dependencies but face challenges in effectively integrating positional information while allowing multi-head attention (MHA) flexibility. Prior methods often model semantic and positional differences disparately or apply uniform positional adjustments across heads, potentially limiting representational capacity. This paper introduces ComplexFormer, featuring Complex Multi-Head Attention-CMHA. CMHA empowers each head to independently model semantic and positional differences unified within the complex plane, representing interactions as rotations and scaling. ComplexFormer incorporates two key improvements: (1) a per-head Euler transformation, converting real-valued query/key projections into polar-form complex vectors for head-specific complex subspace operation; and (2) a per-head adaptive differential rotation mechanism, exp[i(Adapt(ASmn,i) + Delta(Pmn),i)], allowing each head to learn distinct strategies for integrating semantic angle differences (ASmn,i) with relative positional encodings (Delta(Pmn),i). Extensive experiments on language modeling, text generation, code generation, and mathematical reasoning show ComplexFormer achieves superior performance, significantly lower generation perplexity , and improved long-context coherence compared to strong baselines like RoPE-Transformers. ComplexFormer demonstrates strong parameter efficiency, offering a more expressive, adaptable attention mechanism.",

We propose StoryReasoning, a dataset containing 4,178 stories derived from 52,016 movie images, with both structured scene analyses and grounded stories. Each story maintains character and object consistency across frames while explicitly modeling multi-frame relationships through structured tabular representations. Our approach features cross-frame object re-identification using visual similarity and face recognition, chain-of-thought reasoning for explicit narrative modeling, and a grounding scheme that links textual elements to visual entities across multiple frames. We establish baseline performance by fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL 7B, creating Qwen Storyteller, which performs end-to-end object detection, re-identification, and landmark detection while maintaining consistent object references throughout the story. Evaluation demonstrates a reduction from 4.06 to 3.56 (-12.3%) hallucinations on average per story when compared to a non-fine-tuned model.",

    "summary": "The success of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on the observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this neural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model size -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs represent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e., representations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur with varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss scaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only the most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of loss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature frequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong superposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other, the loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide range of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is explained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower dimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales inversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced LLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match the predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also agree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an important mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws. We anticipate that these insights will inspire new training strategies and model architectures to achieve better performance with less computation and fewer parameters.",

    "summary": "It is commonly believed that scaling language models should commit a significant space or time cost, by increasing the parameters (parameter scaling) or output tokens (inference-time scaling). We introduce the third and more inference-efficient scaling paradigm: increasing the model's parallel computation during both training and inference time. We apply $P$ diverse and learnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in parallel, and dynamically aggregate the $P$ outputs. This method, namely parallel scaling (ParScale), scales parallel computation by reusing existing parameters and can be applied to any model structure, optimization procedure, data, or task. We theoretically propose a new scaling law and validate it through large-scale pre-training, which shows that a model with $P$ parallel streams is similar to scaling the parameters by $O(\\log P)$ while showing superior inference efficiency. For example, ParScale can use up to 22$\\times$ less memory increase and 6$\\times$ less latency increase compared to parameter scaling that achieves the same performance improvement. It can also recycle an off-the-shelf pre-trained model into a parallelly scaled one by post-training on a small amount of tokens, further reducing the training budget. The new scaling law we discovered potentially facilitates the deployment of more powerful models in low-resource scenarios, and provides an alternative perspective for the role of computation in machine learning.",

Existing approaches to synthetic data generation fall short in diversity and complexity, failing to replicate real-world data distributions and leading to suboptimal performance after LLM fine-tuning. We present a novel router-based architecture that leverages domain resources like content metadata and structured knowledge graphs, along with text-to-text and vision-to-text language models to generate high-quality synthetic training data. Our architecture's flexible routing mechanism enables synthetic data generation that matches observed real-world distributions, addressing a fundamental limitation of traditional approaches.

However, applying this technique to vision-language models (VLMs) presents two fundamental challenges: small language models that could serve as efficient drafters lack the architectural components to process visual inputs, and their token predictions fail to match those of VLM target models that consider visual context. We introduce Multimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative Decoding of Vision-Language Models (MASSV), which transforms existing small language models into effective multimodal drafters through a two-phase approach. MASSV first connects the target VLM's vision encoder to the draft model via a lightweight trainable projector, then applies self-distilled visual instruction tuning using responses generated by the target VLM to align token predictions. Comprehensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma3 model families demonstrate that MASSV increases accepted length by up to 30% and delivers end-to-end inference speedups of up to 1.46x on visually-grounded tasks. MASSV provides a scalable, architecture-compatible method for accelerating both current and future VLMs.",

    "summary": "While large language models demonstrate impressive performance on static benchmarks, the true potential of large language models as self-learning and reasoning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. This study systematically evaluates the efficacy of self-reflection, heuristic mutation, and planning as prompting techniques to test the adaptive capabilities of agents. We conduct experiments with various open-source language models in dynamic environments and find that larger models generally outperform smaller ones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, a too-long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks, while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting techniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less improvement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making align, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops. Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits persistent limitations in crucial areas such as planning, reasoning, and spatial coordination, suggesting that current-generation large language models still suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through self-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while reasoning methods like Chain of thought improves multi-step reasoning on math word problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important shortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move beyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning.",

To tackle these issues, this article introduces the Materials Knowledge Graph (MKG), which utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques integrated with large language models to extract and systematically organize a decade's worth of high-quality research into structured triples, contains 162,605 nodes and 731,772 edges. MKG categorizes information into comprehensive labels such as Name, Formula, and Application, structured around a meticulously designed ontology, thus enhancing data usability and integration. By implementing network-based algorithms, MKG not only facilitates efficient link prediction but also significantly reduces reliance on traditional experimental methods. This structured approach not only streamlines materials research but also lays the groundwork for more sophisticated science knowledge graphs.",

    "summary": "Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in a wide range of tasks, leading to increasing attention towards the research on how scaling LLMs affects their performance. Existing works, termed Scaling Laws, have discovered that the final test loss of LLMs scales as power-laws with model size, computational budget, and dataset size. However, the temporal change of the test loss of an LLM throughout its pre-training process remains unexplored, though it is valuable in many aspects, such as selecting better hyperparameters \\textit{directly} on the target LLM. In this paper, we propose the novel concept of Temporal Scaling Law, studying how the test loss of an LLM evolves as the training steps scale up. In contrast to modeling the test loss as a whole in a coarse-grained manner, we break it down and dive into the fine-grained test loss of each token position, and further develop a dynamic hyperbolic-law. Afterwards, we derive the much more precise temporal scaling law by studying the temporal patterns of the parameters in the dynamic hyperbolic-law. Results on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) validation datasets demonstrate that our temporal scaling law accurately predicts the test loss of LLMs across training steps. Our temporal scaling law has broad practical applications. First, it enables direct and efficient hyperparameter selection on the target LLM, such as data mixture proportions. Secondly, viewing the LLM pre-training dynamics from the token position granularity provides some insights to enhance the understanding of LLM pre-training.",

    "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely adopted, understanding how they learn from, and memorize, training data becomes crucial. Memorization in LLMs is widely assumed to only occur as a result of sequences being repeated in the training data. Instead, we show that LLMs memorize by assembling information from similar sequences, a phenomena we call mosaic memory. We show major LLMs to exhibit mosaic memory, with fuzzy duplicates contributing to memorization as much as 0.8 of an exact duplicate and even heavily modified sequences contributing substantially to memorization. Despite models display reasoning capabilities, we somewhat surprisingly show memorization to be predominantly syntactic rather than semantic. We finally show fuzzy duplicates to be ubiquitous in real-world data, untouched by deduplication techniques. Taken together, our results challenge widely held beliefs and show memorization to be a more complex, mosaic process, with real-world implications for privacy, confidentiality, model utility and evaluation.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation. Nonetheless, it was also witnessed that LLMs tend to produce inaccurate responses to specific queries. This deficiency can be traced to the tokenization step LLMs must undergo, which is an inevitable limitation inherent to all LLMs. In fact, incorrect tokenization is the critical point that hinders LLMs in understanding the input precisely, thus leading to unsatisfactory output. This defect is more obvious in Chinese scenarios. To demonstrate this flaw of LLMs, we construct an adversarial dataset, named as $\\textbf{ADT (Adversarial Dataset for Tokenizer)}$, which draws upon the vocabularies of various open-source LLMs to challenge LLMs' tokenization. ADT consists of two subsets: the manually constructed ADT-Human and the automatically generated ADT-Auto. Our empirical results reveal that our ADT is highly effective on challenging the tokenization of leading LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama-3, Deepseek-R1 and so on, thus degrading these LLMs' capabilities. Moreover, our method of automatic data generation has been proven efficient and robust, which can be applied to any open-source LLMs. In this paper, we substantially investigate LLMs' vulnerability in terms of challenging their token segmentation, which will shed light on the subsequent research of improving LLMs' capabilities through optimizing their tokenization process and algorithms.",

    "summary": "Effectively analyzing the comments to uncover latent intentions holds immense value in making strategic decisions across various domains. However, several challenges hinder the process of sentiment analysis including the lexical diversity exhibited in comments, the presence of long dependencies within the text, encountering unknown symbols and words, and dealing with imbalanced datasets. Moreover, existing sentiment analysis tasks mostly leveraged sequential models to encode the long dependent texts and it requires longer execution time as it processes the text sequentially. In contrast, the Transformer requires less execution time due to its parallel processing nature. In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid deep learning model, RoBERTa-BiLSTM, which combines the Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. RoBERTa is utilized to generate meaningful word embedding vectors, while BiLSTM effectively captures the contextual semantics of long-dependent texts. The RoBERTa-BiLSTM hybrid model leverages the strengths of both sequential and Transformer models to enhance performance in sentiment analysis. We conducted experiments using datasets from IMDb, Twitter US Airline, and Sentiment140 to evaluate the proposed model against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the RoBERTa-BiLSTM model surpasses baseline models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa-base, RoBERTa-GRU, and RoBERTa-LSTM), achieving accuracies of 80.74%, 92.36%, and 82.25% on the Twitter US Airline, IMDb, and Sentiment140 datasets, respectively. Additionally, the model achieves F1-scores of 80.73%, 92.35%, and 82.25% on the same datasets, respectively.",

    "summary": "In this study, we investigate whether attention-based information flow inside large language models (LLMs) is aggregated through noticeable patterns for long context processing. Our observations reveal that LLMs aggregate information through Pyramidal Information Funneling where attention is scattering widely in lower layers, progressively consolidating within specific contexts, and ultimately focusing on critical tokens (a.k.a massive activation or attention sink) in higher layers. Motivated by these insights, we developed PyramidKV, a novel and effective KV cache compression method. This approach dynamically adjusts the KV cache size across different layers, allocating more cache in lower layers and less in higher ones, diverging from traditional methods that maintain a uniform KV cache size. Our experimental evaluations, utilizing the LongBench benchmark, show that PyramidKV matches the performance of models with a full KV cache while retaining only 12% of the KV cache, thus significantly reducing memory usage. In scenarios emphasizing memory efficiency, where only 0.7% of the KV cache is maintained, PyramidKV surpasses other KV cache compression techniques, achieving up to a 20.5 absolute accuracy improvement on TREC dataset. In the Needle-in-a-Haystack experiment, PyramidKV outperforms competing methods in maintaining long-context comprehension in LLMs; notably, retaining just 128 KV cache entries enables the LLAMA-3-70B model to achieve 100.0 Acc. performance.",

    "summary": "Recent work on distilling Whisper's knowledge into small models using pseudo-labels shows promising performance while reducing the size by up to 50%. This results in small, efficient, and dedicated models. However, a critical step of distillation using pseudo-labels involves filtering high-quality predictions and using only those during training. This step requires ground truth labels to compare with and filter low-quality examples, making the process dependent on human labels. Additionally, the distillation process requires a large amount of data thereby limiting its applicability in low-resource settings. To address this, we propose a distillation framework that does not require any labeled data. Through experimentation, we show that our best-distilled models outperform the teacher model by 5-7 WER points and are on par with or outperform similar supervised data filtering setups. When scaling the data, our models significantly outperform all zero-shot and supervised models. Our models are also 25-50% more compute- and memory-efficient while maintaining performance equal to or better than that of the teacher model.

Conversational Query Reformulation (CQR) improves conversational search by refining the original queries into de-contextualized forms to resolve the issues in the original queries, such as omissions and coreferences. Previous CQR methods focus on imitating human written queries which may not always yield meaningful search results for the retriever. In this paper, we introduce GuideCQR, a framework that refines queries for CQR by leveraging key information from the initially retrieved documents. Specifically, GuideCQR extracts keywords and generates expected answers from the retrieved documents, then unifies them with the queries after filtering to add useful information that enhances the search process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, outperforming previous CQR methods. Additionally, we show that GuideCQR can get additional performance gains in conversational search using various types of queries, even for queries written by humans.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit human-like intelligence, enabling them to simulate human behavior and support various applications that require both humanized communication and extensive knowledge reserves. Efforts are made to personify LLMs with special training data or hand-crafted prompts, while correspondingly faced with challenges such as insufficient data usage or rigid behavior patterns. Consequently, personified LLMs fail to capture personified knowledge or express persistent opinion. To fully unlock the potential of LLM personification, we propose PersLLM, a framework for better data construction and model tuning. For insufficient data usage, we incorporate strategies such as Chain-of-Thought prompting and anti-induction, improving the quality of data construction and capturing the personality experiences, knowledge, and thoughts more comprehensively. For rigid behavior patterns, we design the tuning process and introduce automated DPO to enhance the specificity and dynamism of the models' personalities, which leads to a more natural opinion communication. Both automated metrics and expert human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Case studies in human-machine interactions and multi-agent systems further suggest potential application scenarios and future directions for LLM personification.",

    "summary": "The prohibitive training costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a significant bottleneck in the development of next-generation LLMs. In this paper, we show that it is possible to significantly reduce the training costs of LLMs without sacrificing their performance. Specifically, we introduce patch-level training for LLMs, in which multiple tokens are aggregated into a unit of higher information density, referred to as a `patch', to serve as the fundamental text unit for training LLMs. During patch-level training, we feed the language model shorter sequences of patches and train it to predict the next patch, thereby processing the majority of the training data at a significantly reduced cost. Following this, the model continues token-level training on the remaining training data to align with the inference mode. Experiments on a diverse range of models (370M-2.7B parameters) demonstrate that patch-level training can reduce the overall training costs to 0.5$\\times$, without compromising the model performance compared to token-level training.

    "summary": "The quantization of large language models (LLMs) has been a prominent research area aimed at enabling their lightweight deployment in practice. Existing research about LLM's quantization has mainly explored the interplay between weights and activations, or employing auxiliary components while neglecting the necessity of adjusting weights during quantization. Consequently, original weight distributions frequently fail to yield desired results after round-to-nearest (RTN) quantization. Even though incorporating techniques such as mixed precision and low-rank error approximation in LLM's quantization can yield improved results, they inevitably introduce additional computational overhead. On the other hand, traditional techniques for weight quantization, such as Generative Post-Training Quantization, rely on manually tweaking weight distributions to minimize local errors, but they fall short of achieving globally optimal outcomes. Although the recently proposed Learnable Singular-value Increment improves global weight quantization by modifying weight distributions, it disrupts the original distribution considerably. This introduces pronounced bias toward the training data and can degrade downstream task performance. In this paper, we introduce Singular-value Diagonal Expansion, a more nuanced approach to refining weight distributions to achieve better quantization alignment. Furthermore, we introduce Cross-layer Learning that improves overall quantization outcomes by distributing errors more evenly across layers. Our plug-and-play weight-quantization methods demonstrate substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, including OmniQuant, DuQuant, and PrefixQuant.",

In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.",

By simulating different retrieval and selection conditions through a controlled mixture of gold and distractor knowledge, we assess the impact of these factors on generation outcomes. Our findings indicate that the downstream generator model's capability, as well as the complexity of the task and dataset, significantly influence the impact of knowledge selection on the overall RAG system performance. In typical scenarios, improving the knowledge recall score is key to enhancing generation outcomes, with the knowledge selector providing limited benefit when a strong generator model is used on clear, well-defined tasks. For weaker generator models or more ambiguous tasks and datasets, the knowledge F1 score becomes a critical factor, and the knowledge selector plays a more prominent role in improving overall performance.",

    "summary": "Temporal claims, often riddled with inaccuracies, are a significant challenge in the digital misinformation landscape. Fact-checking systems that can accurately verify such claims are crucial for combating misinformation. Current systems struggle with the complexities of evaluating the accuracy of these claims, especially when they include multiple, overlapping, or recurring events. We introduce a novel timeline-based fact verification framework that identify events from both claim and evidence and organize them into their respective chronological timelines. The framework systematically examines the relationships between the events in both claim and evidence to predict the veracity of each claim event and their chronological accuracy. This allows us to accurately determine the overall veracity of the claim. We also introduce a new dataset of complex temporal claims involving timeline-based reasoning for the training and evaluation of our proposed framework. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling the intricacies of temporal claim verification.",

    "summary": "The modeling of industrial scenes is essential for simulations in industrial manufacturing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in generating general 3D scenes from textual descriptions, generating industrial scenes with LLMs poses a unique challenge due to their demand for precise measurements and positioning, requiring complex planning over spatial arrangement. To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an LLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent ensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format, layout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative requirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs powered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to 81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and effectively meeting most scene generation requirements. To further enhance accessibility, we construct SceneInstruct, a dataset designed for fine-tuning open-source LLMs to integrate into SceneGenAgent. Experiments show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on SceneInstruct yields significant performance improvements, with Llama3.1-70B approaching the capabilities of GPT-4o.

    "summary": "Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) usually take input as a concatenation of image token embeddings and text token embeddings and conduct causal modeling. However, their internal behaviors remain underexplored, raising the question of interaction among two types of tokens. To investigate such multimodal interaction during model inference, in this paper, we measure the contextualization among the hidden state vectors of tokens from different modalities. Our experiments uncover a four-phase inference dynamics of VLLMs against the depth of Transformer-based LMs, including (I) Alignment: In very early layers, contextualization emerges between modalities, suggesting a feature space alignment. (II) Intra-modal Encoding: In early layers, intra-modal contextualization is enhanced while inter-modal interaction is suppressed, suggesting a local encoding within modalities. (III) Inter-modal Encoding: In later layers, contextualization across modalities is enhanced, suggesting a deeper fusion across modalities. (IV) Output Preparation: In very late layers, contextualization is reduced globally, and hidden states are aligned towards the unembedding space.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in handling complex tasks requiring both extensive knowledge and reasoning abilities. However, the existing LLM inference pipeline operates as an opaque process without explicit separation between knowledge retrieval and reasoning steps, making the model's decision-making process unclear and disorganized. This ambiguity can lead to issues such as hallucinations and knowledge forgetting, which significantly impact the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we propose a new inference paradigm that decomposes the complex inference process into two distinct and clear actions: (1) memory recall: which retrieves relevant knowledge, and (2) reasoning: which performs logical steps based on the recalled knowledge. To facilitate this decomposition, we introduce two special tokens memory and reason, guiding the model to distinguish between steps that require knowledge retrieval and those that involve reasoning. Our experiment results show that this decomposition not only improves model performance but also enhances the interpretability of the inference process, enabling users to identify sources of error and refine model responses effectively.

    "summary": "Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains essential for knowledge-based question answering (KBQA), current paradigms face critical challenges under specific domains. Existing methods struggle with targeted adaptation on small-scale KBs: vanilla unsupervised training exhibits poor effectiveness, while fine-tuning incurs prohibitive costs of external signals. We present KBAlign, a self-supervised framework that enhances RAG systems through efficient model adaptation. Our key insight is to leverage the model's intrinsic capabilities for knowledge alignment through two innovative mechanisms: multi-grained self-annotation that captures global knowledge for data construction, and iterative tuning that accelerates convergence through self verification. This framework enables cost-effective model adaptation to specific textual KBs, without human supervision or external model assistance. Experiments demonstrate that KBAlign can achieve 90\\% of the performance gain obtained through GPT-4-supervised adaptation, while relying entirely on self-annotation of much smaller models. KBAlign significantly improves downstream QA accuracy across multiple domains with tiny costs, particularly benefiting scenarios requiring deep knowledge integration from specialized corpora. We release our experimental data, models, and process analyses to the community for further exploration (this https URL).",

    "summary": "We propose two simple, principled and practical algorithms that enjoy provable scaling laws for the test-time compute of large language models (LLMs). The first one is a two-stage knockout-style algorithm: given an input problem, it first generates multiple candidate solutions, and then aggregate them via a knockout tournament for the final output. Assuming that the LLM can generate a correct solution with non-zero probability and do better than a random guess in comparing a pair of correct and incorrect solutions, we prove theoretically that the failure probability of this algorithm decays to zero exponentially or by a power law (depending on the specific way of scaling) as its test-time compute grows. The second one is a two-stage league-style algorithm, where each candidate is evaluated by its average win rate against multiple opponents, rather than eliminated upon loss to a single opponent. Under analogous but more robust assumptions, we prove that its failure probability also decays to zero exponentially with more test-time compute. Both algorithms require a black-box LLM and nothing else (e.g., no verifier or reward model) for a minimalistic implementation, which makes them appealing for practical applications and easy to adapt for different tasks. Through extensive experiments with diverse models and datasets, we validate the proposed theories and demonstrate the outstanding scaling properties of both algorithms.",

    "summary": "Transformer-based large-scale pre-trained models achieve great success. Fine-tuning is the standard practice for leveraging these models in downstream tasks. Among the fine-tuning methods, adapter-tuning provides a parameter-efficient fine-tuning by introducing lightweight trainable modules while keeping most pre-trained parameters frozen. However, existing adapter-tuning methods still impose substantial resource usage. Through our investigation, we show that each adapter unequally contributes to both task performance and resource usage. Motivated by this insight, we propose Selective Adapter FrEezing (SAFE), which gradually freezes less important adapters early to reduce unnecessary resource usage while maintaining performance. In our experiments, SAFE reduces memory usage, computation amount, and training time by 42.85\\%, 34.59\\%, and 11.82\\%, respectively, while achieving comparable or better task performance compared to the baseline. We also demonstrate that SAFE induces regularization effect, thereby smoothing the loss landscape, which enables the model to generalize better by avoiding sharp minima.",

In this paper, we first introduce ZeroCF, a faithful approach for leveraging important words derived from feature attribution methods to generate counterfactual examples in a zero-shot setting. Second, we present a new framework, FitCF, which further verifies aforementioned counterfactuals by label flip verification and then inserts them as demonstrations for few-shot prompting, outperforming two state-of-the-art baselines. Through ablation studies, we identify the importance of each of FitCF's core components in improving the quality of counterfactuals, as assessed through flip rate, perplexity, and similarity measures. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of LIME and Integrated Gradients as backbone attribution methods for FitCF and find that the number of demonstrations has the largest effect on performance. Finally, we reveal a strong correlation between the faithfulness of feature attribution scores and the quality of generated counterfactuals.",

    "summary": "Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are widely used to assess medical students' communication skills, but scoring interview-based assessments is time-consuming and potentially subject to human bias. This study explored the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate OSCE evaluations using the Master Interview Rating Scale (MIRS). We compared the performance of four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Llama 3.1, and Gemini 1.5 Pro) in evaluating OSCE transcripts across all 28 items of the MIRS under the conditions of zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), few-shot, and multi-step prompting. The models were benchmarked against a dataset of 10 OSCE cases with 174 expert consensus scores available. Model performance was measured using three accuracy metrics (exact, off-by-one, thresholded). Averaging across all MIRS items and OSCE cases, LLMs performed with low exact accuracy (0.27 to 0.44), and moderate to high off-by-one accuracy (0.67 to 0.87) and thresholded accuracy (0.75 to 0.88). A zero temperature parameter ensured high intra-rater reliability ({\\alpha} = 0.98 for GPT-4o). CoT, few-shot, and multi-step techniques proved valuable when tailored to specific assessment items. The performance was consistent across MIRS items, independent of encounter phases and communication domains. We demonstrated the feasibility of AI-assisted OSCE evaluation and provided benchmarking of multiple LLMs across multiple prompt techniques. Our work provides a baseline performance assessment for LLMs that lays a foundation for future research into automated assessment of clinical communication skills.",

To address this issue, we propose a novel intuitive framework that, at its very core, performs MHA compression through a multi-head tensorisation process and the Tucker decomposition. This enables both higher-dimensional structured denoising and compression of the MHA weights, by enforcing a shared higher-dimensional subspace across the weights of the multiple attention heads. We demonstrate that this approach consistently enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs across multiple benchmark datasets, and for both encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, while achieving compression rates of up to $\\sim 250$ times in the MHA weights, all without requiring any additional data, training, or fine-tuning. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method can be seamlessly combined with existing FFN-only-based denoising techniques to achieve further improvements in LLM reasoning performance.",

To mitigate this challenge, we propose a novel task and create a human-to-human video-driven multilingual mixed-type dialogue corpus, termed KwaiChat, containing a total of 93,209 videos and 246,080 dialogues, across 4 dialogue types, 30 domains, 4 languages, and 13 topics. Additionally, we establish baseline models on KwaiChat. An extensive analysis of 7 distinct LLMs on KwaiChat reveals that GPT-4o achieves the best performance but still cannot perform well in this situation even with the help of in-context learning and fine-tuning, which indicates that the task is not trivial and needs further research.",

    "summary": "Despite significant advancements in large language models (LLMs), a major drawback of reasoning models is their enormous token usage, which increases computational cost, resource requirements, and response time. In this work, we revisit the core principles of reinforcement learning (RL) and, through mathematical analysis, demonstrate that the tendency to generate lengthy responses arises inherently from RL-based optimization during training. This finding questions the prevailing assumption that longer responses inherently improve reasoning accuracy. Instead, we uncover a natural correlation between conciseness and accuracy that has been largely overlooked. We show that introducing a secondary phase of RL training, using a very small set of problems, can significantly reduce chains of thought while maintaining or even enhancing accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that, while GRPO shares some interesting properties of PPO, it suffers from collapse modes, which limit its reliability for concise reasoning. Finally, we validate our conclusions through extensive experimental results.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable across academia, industry, and daily applications, yet current evaluation methods struggle to keep pace with their rapid development. One core challenge of evaluation in the large language model (LLM) era is the generalization issue: how to infer a model's near-unbounded abilities from inevitably bounded benchmarks. We address this challenge by proposing Model Utilization Index (MUI), a mechanism interpretability enhanced metric that complements traditional performance scores. MUI quantifies the effort a model expends on a task, defined as the proportion of activated neurons or features during inference. Intuitively, a truly capable model should achieve higher performance with lower effort. Extensive experiments across popular LLMs reveal a consistent inverse logarithmic relationship between MUI and performance, which we formulate as the Utility Law. From this law we derive four practical corollaries that (i) guide training diagnostics, (ii) expose data contamination issue, (iii) enable fairer model comparisons, and (iv) design model-specific dataset diversity.

    "summary": "Navigating high-stakes dilemmas involving conflicting values is challenging even for humans, let alone for AI. Yet prior work in evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in such situations has been limited to everyday scenarios. To close this gap, this work first introduces CLASH (Character perspective-based LLM Assessments in Situations with High-stakes), a meticulously curated dataset consisting of 345 high-impact dilemmas along with 3,795 individual perspectives of diverse values. In particular, we design CLASH in a way to support the study of critical aspects of value-based decision-making processes which are missing from prior work, including understanding decision ambivalence and psychological discomfort as well as capturing the temporal shifts of values in characters' perspectives. By benchmarking 10 open and closed frontier models, we uncover several key findings. (1) Even the strongest models, such as GPT-4o and Claude-Sonnet, achieve less than 50% accuracy in identifying situations where the decision should be ambivalent, while they perform significantly better in clear-cut scenarios. (2) While LLMs reasonably predict psychological discomfort as marked by human, they inadequately comprehend perspectives involving value shifts, indicating a need for LLMs to reason over complex values. (3) Our experiments also reveal a significant correlation between LLMs' value preferences and their steerability towards a given value. (4) Finally, LLMs exhibit greater steerability when engaged in value reasoning from a third-party perspective, compared to a first-person setup, though certain value pairs benefit uniquely from the first-person framing.",

    "summary": "This study addresses the critical challenge of hallucination mitigation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks through a Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) framework. While LVLMs excel in multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under user-defined risk levels ($\\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous control of \\textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain strictly below $\\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes inversely with $\\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces theoretical guarantees across all $\\alpha$ values. The framework achieves stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios, underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems, offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware decision-making.",

    "summary": "The recent development of reasoning language models (RLMs) represents a novel evolution in large language models. In particular, the recent release of DeepSeek-R1 has generated widespread social impact and sparked enthusiasm in the research community for exploring the explicit reasoning paradigm of language models. However, the implementation details of the released models have not been fully open-sourced by DeepSeek, including DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and the distilled small models. As a result, many replication studies have emerged aiming to reproduce the strong performance achieved by DeepSeek-R1, reaching comparable performance through similar training procedures and fully open-source data resources. These works have investigated feasible strategies for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), focusing on data preparation and method design, yielding various valuable insights. In this report, we provide a summary of recent replication studies to inspire future research. We primarily focus on SFT and RLVR as two main directions, introducing the details for data construction, method design and training procedure of current replication studies. Moreover, we conclude key findings from the implementation details and experimental results reported by these studies, anticipating to inspire future research. We also discuss additional techniques of enhancing RLMs, highlighting the potential of expanding the application scope of these models, and discussing the challenges in development. By this survey, we aim to help researchers and developers of RLMs stay updated with the latest advancements, and seek to inspire new ideas to further enhance RLMs.",

    "summary": "Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through reinforcement learning (RL). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's interpretability and performance. To this end, we introduce a new class of generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. RM-R1 features a chain-of-rubrics (CoR) mechanism -- self-generating sample-level chat rubrics or math/code solutions, and evaluating candidate responses against them. The training of M-R1 consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across three reward model benchmarks on average, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., INF-ORM-Llama3.1-70B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 4.9%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at this https URL.",

This is particularly critical in public health, where failure to retrieve relevant, accurate, and current information could significantly impact UK residents. However, currently little is known about LLM knowledge of UK Government public health information. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new benchmark, PubHealthBench, with over 8000 questions for evaluating LLMs' Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and free form responses to public health queries. To create PubHealthBench we extract free text from 687 current UK government guidance documents and implement an automated pipeline for generating MCQA samples. Assessing 24 LLMs on PubHealthBench we find the latest private LLMs (GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1 and o1) have a high degree of knowledge, achieving >90% accuracy in the MCQA setup, and outperform humans with cursory search engine use. However, in the free form setup we see lower performance with no model scoring >75%. Importantly we find in both setups LLMs have higher accuracy on guidance intended for the general public. Therefore, there are promising signs that state of the art (SOTA) LLMs are an increasingly accurate source of public health information, but additional safeguards or tools may still be needed when providing free form responses on public health topics.",

However, existing approaches often produce coarse-grained scores and lack detailed reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential as zero-shot evaluators, they remain susceptible to bias, inconsistencies with human judgment, and limited transparency in scoring decisions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SAS-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based SAS tasks. SAS-Bench provides fine-grained, step-wise scoring, expert-annotated error categories, and a diverse range of question types derived from real-world subject-specific exams. This benchmark facilitates detailed evaluation of model reasoning processes and explainability. We also release an open-source dataset containing 1,030 questions and 4,109 student responses, each annotated by domain experts. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments with various LLMs, identifying major challenges in scoring science-related questions and highlighting the effectiveness of few-shot prompting in improving scoring accuracy. Our work offers valuable insights into the development of more robust, fair, and educationally meaningful LLM-based evaluation systems.",

In this work, we propose a method to learn from internet-scale videos that do not have robot action labels. We first train an action quantization model leveraging VQ-VAE-based objective to learn discrete latent actions between image frames, then pretrain a latent VLA model to predict these latent actions from observations and task descriptions, and finally finetune the VLA on small-scale robot manipulation data to map from latent to robot actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing techniques that train robot manipulation policies from large-scale videos. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model trained with robotic action labels on real-world manipulation tasks that require language conditioning, generalization to unseen objects, and semantic generalization to unseen instructions. Training only on human manipulation videos also shows positive transfer, opening up the potential for leveraging web-scale data for robotics foundation model.",

With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), NLRL can be practically implemented to achieve RL-like policy and value improvement by either pure prompting or gradient-based training.

Existing studies have explored various fusion paradigms and consistency constraints to improve the alignment of equivalent entities, while overlooking that the visual modality may not always contribute positively. Empirically, entities with low-similarity images usually generate unsatisfactory performance, highlighting the limitation of overly relying on visual features. We believe the model can be biased toward the visual modality, leading to a shortcut image-matching task. To address this, we propose a counterfactual debiasing framework for MMEA, termed CDMEA, which investigates visual modality bias from a causal perspective. Our approach aims to leverage both visual and graph modalities to enhance MMEA while suppressing the direct causal effect of the visual modality on model predictions. By estimating the Total Effect (TE) of both modalities and excluding the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of the visual modality, we ensure that the model predicts based on the Total Indirect Effect (TIE), effectively utilizing both modalities and reducing visual modality bias. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets show that CDMEA outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods, especially in low-similarity, high-noise, and low-resource data scenarios.",

How is this implemented in the forward pass of modern transformer models? To study this, we consider a structured family of few-shot learning tasks for which the true prediction rule is to add an integer $k$ to the input. We find that Llama-3-8B attains high accuracy on this task for a range of $k$, and localize its few-shot ability to just three attention heads via a novel optimization approach. We further show the extracted signals lie in a six-dimensional subspace, where four of the dimensions track the unit digit and the other two dimensions track overall magnitude. We finally examine how these heads extract information from individual few-shot examples, identifying a self-correction mechanism in which mistakes from earlier examples are suppressed by later examples. Our results demonstrate how tracking low-dimensional subspaces across a forward pass can provide insight into fine-grained computational structures.",

    "summary": "In recent times, we have seen a rapid development of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). They have shown impressive results on academic benchmarks, primarily in widely spoken languages but lack performance on low-resource languages and varied cultural contexts. To address these limitations, we introduce Maya, an open-source Multilingual VLM. Our contributions are: 1) a multilingual image-text pretraining dataset in eight languages, based on the LLaVA pretraining dataset; and 2) a multilingual image-text model supporting these languages, enhancing cultural and linguistic comprehension in vision-language tasks.

    "summary": "Location-based service (LBS) applications proliferate and support transportation, entertainment, and more. Modern mobile platforms, with smartphones being a prominent example, rely on terrestrial and satellite infrastructures (e.g., global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and crowdsourced Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, and IP databases) for correct positioning. However, they are vulnerable to attacks that manipulate positions to control and undermine LBS functionality -- thus enabling the scamming of users or services. Our work reveals that GNSS spoofing attacks succeed even though smartphones have multiple sources of positioning information. Moreover, that Wi-Fi spoofing attacks with GNSS jamming are surprisingly effective. More concerning is the evidence that sophisticated, coordinated spoofing attacks are highly effective. Attacks can target GNSS in combination with other positioning methods, thus defenses that assume that only GNSS is under attack cannot be effective. More so, resilient GNSS receivers and special-purpose antennas are not feasible on smartphones. To address this gap, we propose an extended receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) framework that leverages the readily available, redundant, often so-called opportunistic positioning information on off-the-shelf platforms. We jointly use onboard sensors, terrestrial infrastructures, and GNSS. We show that our extended RAIM framework improves resilience against location spoofing, e.g., achieving a detection accuracy improvement of up to 24-58% compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms and location providers; detecting attacks within 5 seconds, with a low false positive rate.",

    "summary": "Enterprise networks are growing ever larger with a rapidly expanding attack surface, increasing the volume of security alerts generated from security controls. Security Operations Centre (SOC) analysts triage these alerts to identify malicious activity, but they struggle with alert fatigue due to the overwhelming number of benign alerts. Organisations are turning to managed SOC providers, where the problem is amplified by context switching and limited visibility into business processes.\nA novel system, named AACT, is introduced that automates SOC workflows by learning from analysts' triage actions on cybersecurity alerts. It accurately predicts triage decisions in real time, allowing benign alerts to be closed automatically and critical ones prioritised. This reduces the SOC queue allowing analysts to focus on the most severe, relevant or ambiguous threats. The system has been trained and evaluated on both real SOC data and an open dataset, obtaining high performance in identifying malicious alerts from benign alerts.\nAdditionally, the system has demonstrated high accuracy in a real SOC environment, reducing alerts shown to analysts by 61% over six months, with a low false negative rate of 1.36% over millions of alerts.",

    "summary": "The untraceability of transactions facilitated by Ethereum mixing services like Tornado Cash poses significant challenges to blockchain security and financial regulation. Existing methods for correlating mixing accounts suffer from limited labeled data and vulnerability to noisy annotations, which restrict their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose StealthLink, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through cross-task domain-invariant feature learning. Our key innovation lies in transferring knowledge from the well-studied domain of blockchain anomaly detection to the data-scarce task of mixing transaction tracing. Specifically, we design a MixFusion module that constructs and encodes mixing subgraphs to capture local transactional patterns, while introducing a knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns discriminative features across domains through adversarial discrepancy minimization. This dual approach enables robust feature learning under label scarcity and distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on real-world mixing transaction datasets demonstrate that StealthLink achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 96.98\\% F1-score in 10-shot learning scenarios. Notably, our framework shows superior generalization capability in imbalanced data conditions than conventional supervised methods. This work establishes the first systematic approach for cross-domain knowledge transfer in blockchain forensics, providing a practical solution for combating privacy-enhanced financial crimes in decentralized ecosystems.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various domains but pose inherent privacy risks. Existing methods to evaluate privacy leakage in LLMs often use memorized prefixes or simple instructions to extract data, both of which well-alignment models can easily block. Meanwhile, Jailbreak attacks bypass LLM safety mechanisms to generate harmful content, but their role in privacy scenarios remains underexplored. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks in extracting sensitive information, bridging privacy leakage and jailbreak attacks in LLMs. Moreover, we propose PIG, a novel framework targeting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and addressing the limitations of current jailbreak methods. Specifically, PIG identifies PII entities and their types in privacy queries, uses in-context learning to build a privacy context, and iteratively updates it with three gradient-based strategies to elicit target PII. We evaluate PIG and existing jailbreak methods using two privacy-related datasets. Experiments on four white-box and two black-box LLMs show that PIG outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results. The results underscore significant privacy risks in LLMs, emphasizing the need for stronger safeguards. Our code is availble at \\href{this https URL}{this https URL}.",

    "summary": "Smart contracts have been a topic of interest in blockchain research and are a key enabling technology for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in the era of Web 3.0. These contracts enable trustless interactions without the need for intermediaries, as they operate based on predefined rules encoded on the blockchain. However, smart contacts face significant challenges in cross-contract communication and information sharing, making it difficult to establish seamless connectivity and collaboration among CAVs with Web 3.0. In this paper, we propose DeFeed, a novel secure protocol that incorporates various gas-saving functions for CAVs, originated from in-depth research into the interaction among smart contracts for decentralized cross-contract data feed in Web 3.0. DeFeed allows smart contracts to obtain information from other contracts efficiently in a single click, without complicated operations. We judiciously design and complete various functions with DeFeed, including a pool function and a cache function for gas optimization, a subscribe function for facilitating data access, and an update function for the future iteration of our protocol. Tailored for CAVs with Web 3.0 use cases, DeFeed enables efficient data feed between smart contracts underpinning decentralized applications and vehicle coordination. Implemented and tested on the Ethereum official test network, DeFeed demonstrates significant improvements in contract interaction efficiency, reducing computational complexity and gas costs. Our solution represents a critical step towards seamless, decentralized communication in Web 3.0 ecosystems.",

With the popularity of devices, related security and privacy risks arise at the same time as they collect user-related data and transmit it to various service providers. Although China accounts for a larger share of the consumer IoT industry, current analyses on consumer IoT device traffic primarily focus on regions such as Europe, the United States, and Australia. Research on China, however, is currently rather rare. This study constructs the first large-scale dataset about consumer IoT device traffic in China. Specifically, we propose a fine-grained traffic collection guidance covering the entire lifecycle of consumer IoT devices, gathering traffic from 70 devices spanning 36 brands and 8 device categories. Based on this dataset, we analyze traffic destinations and encryption practices across different device types during the entire lifecycle and compare the findings with the results of other regions. Compared to other regions, our results show that consumer IoT devices in China rely more on domestic services and overally perform better in terms of encryption practices. However, there are still 20/35 devices improperly conduct certificate validation, and 5/70 devices use insecure encryption protocols. To facilitate future research, we open-source our traffic collection guidance and make our dataset publicly available.",

    "summary": "The integration of large language models (LLMs) into cyber security applications presents significant opportunities, such as enhancing threat analysis and malware detection, but can also introduce critical risks and safety concerns, including personal data leakage and automated generation of new malware. We present a systematic evaluation of safety risks in fine-tuned LLMs for cyber security applications. Using the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications framework, we assessed seven open-source LLMs: Phi 3 Mini 3.8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Llama 3 8B, Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 2 70B. Our evaluation shows that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all tested LLMs (e.g., the safety score of Llama 3.1 8B against prompt injection drops from 0.95 to 0.15). We propose and evaluate a safety alignment approach that carefully rewords instruction-response pairs to include explicit safety precautions and ethical considerations. This approach demonstrates that it is possible to maintain or even improve model safety while preserving technical utility, offering a practical path forward for developing safer fine-tuning methodologies. This work offers a systematic evaluation for safety risks in LLMs, enabling safer adoption of generative AI in sensitive domains, and contributing towards the development of secure, trustworthy, and ethically aligned LLMs.",

We present PRACLeak, a novel attack that exploits these timing differences to leak sensitive information, such as secret keys from vulnerable AES implementations, by monitoring memory access latencies.\nTo counter this, we propose Timing-Safe PRAC (TPRAC), a defense that eliminates PRAC-induced timing channels without compromising RH mitigation efficacy. TPRAC uses Timing-Based RFMs, issued periodically and independent of memory activity. It requires only a single-entry in-DRAM mitigation queue per DRAM bank and is compatible with existing DRAM standards. Our evaluations demonstrate that TPRAC closes timing channels while incurring only 3.4% performance overhead at the RH threshold of 1024.",

However, it is vulnerable to sophisticated falsification attacks by authenticated insiders that can destabilize the formation and potentially cause catastrophic collisions. This paper addresses this challenge: misbehavior detection in vehicle platooning systems. We present AttentionGuard, a transformer-based framework for misbehavior detection that leverages the self-attention mechanism to identify anomalous patterns in mobility data. Our proposal employs a multi-head transformer-encoder to process sequential kinematic information, enabling effective differentiation between normal mobility patterns and falsification attacks across diverse platooning scenarios, including steady-state (no-maneuver) operation, join, and exit maneuvers. Our evaluation uses an extensive simulation dataset featuring various attack vectors (constant, gradual, and combined falsifications) and operational parameters (controller types, vehicle speeds, and attacker positions). Experimental results demonstrate that AttentionGuard achieves up to 0.95 F1-score in attack detection, with robust performance maintained during complex maneuvers. Notably, our system performs effectively with minimal latency (100ms decision intervals), making it suitable for real-time transportation safety applications. Comparative analysis reveals superior detection capabilities and establishes the transformer-encoder as a promising approach for securing Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) against sophisticated insider threats.",

    "summary": "Local Differential Privacy (LDP) has been widely recognized as a powerful tool for providing a strong theoretical guarantee of data privacy to data contributors against an untrusted data collector. Under a typical LDP scheme, each data contributor independently randomly perturbs their data before submitting them to the data collector, which in turn infers valuable statistics about the original data from received perturbed data. Common to existing LDP mechanisms is an inherent trade-off between the level of privacy protection and data utility in the sense that strong data privacy often comes at the cost of reduced data utility. Frequency estimation based on Randomized Response (RR) is a fundamental building block of many LDP mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Randomized Response (JRR) mechanism based on correlated data perturbations to achieve locally differentially private frequency estimation. JRR divides data contributors into disjoint groups of two members and lets those in the same group jointly perturb their binary data to improve frequency-estimation accuracy and achieve the same level of data privacy by hiding the group membership information in contrast to the classical RR mechanism. Theoretical analysis and detailed simulation studies using both real and synthetic datasets show that JRR achieves the same level of data privacy as the classical RR mechanism while improving the frequency-estimation accuracy in the overwhelming majority of the cases by up to two orders of magnitude.",

    "summary": "We study the security of stock price forecasting using Deep Learning (DL) in computational finance. Despite abundant prior research on the vulnerability of DL to adversarial perturbations, such work has hitherto hardly addressed practical adversarial threat models in the context of DL-powered algorithmic trading systems (ATS). Specifically, we investigate the vulnerability of ATS to adversarial perturbations launched by a realistically constrained attacker. We first show that existing literature has paid limited attention to DL security in the financial domain, which is naturally attractive for adversaries. Then, we formalize the concept of ephemeral perturbations (EP), which can be used to stage a novel type of attack tailored for DL-based ATS. Finally, we carry out an end-to-end evaluation of our EP against a profitable ATS. Our results reveal that the introduction of small changes to the input stock prices not only (i) induces the DL model to behave incorrectly but also (ii) leads the whole ATS to make suboptimal buy/sell decisions, resulting in a worse financial performance of the targeted ATS.",

    "summary": "While providing economic and software development value, software supply chains are only as strong as their weakest link. Over the past several years, there has been an exponential increase in cyberattacks, specifically targeting vulnerable links in critical software supply chains. These attacks disrupt the day-to-day functioning and threaten the security of nearly everyone on the internet, from billion-dollar companies and government agencies to hobbyist open-source developers. The ever-evolving threat of software supply chain attacks has garnered interest from the software industry and the US government in improving software supply chain security.\nOn September 20, 2024, three researchers from the NSF-backed Secure Software Supply Chain Center (S3C2) conducted a Secure Software Supply Chain Summit with a diverse set of 12 practitioners from 9 companies. The goals of the Summit were to: (1) to enable sharing between individuals from different companies regarding practical experiences and challenges with software supply chain security, (2) to help form new collaborations, (3) to share our observations from our previous summits with industry, and (4) to learn about practitioners' challenges to inform our future research direction. The summit consisted of discussions of six topics relevant to the companies represented, including updating vulnerable dependencies, component and container choice, malicious commits, building infrastructure, large language models, and reducing entire classes of vulnerabilities.",

    "summary": "The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened concerns about the misuse of AI-generated text, making watermarking a promising solution. Mainstream watermarking schemes for LLMs fall into two categories: logits-based and sampling-based. However, current schemes entail trade-offs among robustness, text quality, and security. To mitigate this, we integrate logits-based and sampling-based schemes, harnessing their respective strengths to achieve synergy. In this paper, we propose a versatile symbiotic watermarking framework with three strategies: serial, parallel, and hybrid. The hybrid framework adaptively embeds watermarks using token entropy and semantic entropy, optimizing the balance between detectability, robustness, text quality, and security. Furthermore, we validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We believe this framework provides novel insights into diverse watermarking paradigms. Our code is available at \\href{this https URL}{this https URL}.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly reshape modern life, advancing fields from healthcare to education and beyond. However, alongside their remarkable capabilities lies a significant threat: the susceptibility of these models to jailbreaking. The fundamental vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks stems from the very data they learn from. As long as this training data includes unfiltered, problematic, or 'dark' content, the models can inherently learn undesirable patterns or weaknesses that allow users to circumvent their intended safety controls. Our research identifies the growing threat posed by dark LLMs models deliberately designed without ethical guardrails or modified through jailbreak techniques. In our research, we uncovered a universal jailbreak attack that effectively compromises multiple state-of-the-art models, enabling them to answer almost any question and produce harmful outputs upon request. The main idea of our attack was published online over seven months ago. However, many of the tested LLMs were still vulnerable to this attack. Despite our responsible disclosure efforts, responses from major LLM providers were often inadequate, highlighting a concerning gap in industry practices regarding AI safety. As model training becomes more accessible and cheaper, and as open-source LLMs proliferate, the risk of widespread misuse escalates. Without decisive intervention, LLMs may continue democratizing access to dangerous knowledge, posing greater risks than anticipated.",

    "summary": "We propose a new method for retrieving the algebraic structure of a generic alternant code given an arbitrary generator matrix, provided certain conditions are met. We then discuss how this challenges the security of the McEliece cryptosystem instantiated with this family of codes. The central object of our work is the quadratic hull related to a linear code, defined as the intersection of all quadrics passing through the columns of a given generator or parity-check matrix, where the columns are considered as points in the affine or projective space. The geometric properties of this object reveal important information about the internal algebraic structure of the code. This is particularly evident in the case of generalized Reed-Solomon codes, whose quadratic hull is deeply linked to a well-known algebraic variety called the rational normal curve. By utilizing the concept of Weil restriction of affine varieties, we demonstrate that the quadratic hull of a generic dual alternant code inherits many interesting features from the rational normal curve, on account of the fact that alternant codes are subfield-subcodes of generalized Reed-Solomon codes. If the rate of the generic alternant code is sufficiently high, this allows us to construct a polynomial-time algorithm for retrieving the underlying generalized Reed-Solomon code from which the alternant code is defined, which leads to an efficient key-recovery attack against the McEliece cryptosystem when instantiated with this class of codes. Finally, we discuss the generalization of this approach to Algebraic-Geometry codes and Goppa codes.",

Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed critical vulnerabilities in FL, showing that a malicious central server can manipulate model updates to reconstruct clients' private training data. Existing data reconstruction attacks have important limitations: they often rely on assumptions about the clients' data distribution or their efficiency significantly degrades when batch sizes exceed just a few tens of samples.\nIn this work, we introduce a novel data reconstruction attack that overcomes these limitations. Our method leverages a new geometric perspective on fully connected layers to craft malicious model parameters, enabling the perfect recovery of arbitrarily large data batches in classification tasks without any prior knowledge of clients' data. Through extensive experiments on both image and tabular datasets, we demonstrate that our attack outperforms existing methods and achieves perfect reconstruction of data batches two orders of magnitude larger than the state of the art.",

    "summary": "Federated learning (FL) enhances privacy and reduces communication cost for resource-constrained edge clients by supporting distributed model training at the edge. However, the heterogeneous nature of such devices produces diverse, non-independent, and identically distributed (non-IID) data, making the detection of backdoor attacks more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel federated representative-attention-based defense mechanism, named FeRA, that leverages cross-client attention over internal feature representations to distinguish benign from malicious clients. FeRA computes an anomaly score based on representation reconstruction errors, effectively identifying clients whose internal activations significantly deviate from the group consensus. Our evaluation demonstrates FeRA's robustness across various FL scenarios, including challenging non-IID data distributions typical of edge devices. Experimental results show that it effectively reduces backdoor attack success rates while maintaining high accuracy on the main task. The method is model-agnostic, attack-agnostic, and does not require labeled reference data, making it well suited to heterogeneous and resource-limited edge deployments.",

    "summary": "Audio and speech data are increasingly used in machine learning applications such as speech recognition, speaker identification, and mental health monitoring. However, the passive collection of this data by audio listening devices raises significant privacy concerns. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) offers a promising solution by enabling computations on encrypted data and preserving user privacy. Despite its potential, prior attempts to apply FHE to audio processing have faced challenges, particularly in securely computing time frequency representations, a critical step in many audio tasks.\nHere, we addressed this gap by introducing a fully secure pipeline that computes, with FHE and quantized neural network operations, four fundamental time-frequency representations: Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Mel filterbanks, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), and gammatone filters. Our methods also support the private computation of audio descriptors and convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers. Besides, we proposed approximate STFT algorithms that lighten computation and bit use for statistical and machine learning analyses.\nWe ran experiments on the VocalSet and OxVoc datasets demonstrating the fully private computation of our approach. We showed significant performance improvements with STFT approximation in private statistical analysis of audio markers, and for vocal exercise classification with CNNs. Our results reveal that our approximations substantially reduce error rates compared to conventional STFT implementations in FHE. We also demonstrated a fully private classification based on the raw audio for gender and vocal exercise classification. Finally, we provided a practical heuristic for parameter selection, making quantized approximate signal processing accessible to researchers and practitioners aiming to protect sensitive audio data.",

In addition to technical aspects, such as how to develop a robust industrial control systems hardware, software, communication product, etc., SbD includes also soft aspects, such as organizational managerial attitude and behavior, and employee awareness. Under the Sbd concept, systems, ICS in our context, will be considered more trustworthy by users. User's trust in the systems will be derived from the meticulous adherence to the SbD processes and policies. In accordance with the SbD concept, security is considered. Security measures are implemented, at every stage of the product and systems development life cycle, rather than afterwards. This document presents the security requirements for the implementation of the SbD in industrial control systems. The information presented does not negate any existing security and cyber security standards, etc. Instead, we strongly recommend that organizations should implement and comply with those standards and best practices. Security by design is not a one-time process. It starts at the very beginning of the products of the system design and continues through all its lifecycle. Due to the benefits of the SbD, higher level of security, and robustness to cyber attacks, all organizations associated with the energy sector should strive to establish an ecosystem. The requirements presented in this document may be perceived as burdensome by organizations. However, strict compliance with the requirements and existing security standards and best practices, including continuous monitoring, as specified in this document, is essential to realize an ecosystem driven and protected by the SbD",

As the volume and sophistication of cyber threats continue to grow, there is an increasing need for intelligent systems that can automatically detect vulnerabilities, analyze malware, and respond to attacks. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature on the application of LLMs in cybersecurity (LLM4Security). By comprehensively collecting over 30K relevant papers and systematically analyzing 127 papers from top security and software engineering venues, we aim to provide a holistic view of how LLMs are being used to solve diverse problems across the cybersecurity domain. Through our analysis, we identify several key findings. First, we observe that LLMs are being applied to a wide range of cybersecurity tasks, including vulnerability detection, malware analysis, network intrusion detection, and phishing detection. Second, we find that the datasets used for training and evaluating LLMs in these tasks are often limited in size and diversity, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and representative datasets. Third, we identify several promising techniques for adapting LLMs to specific cybersecurity domains, such as fine-tuning, transfer learning, and domain-specific pre-training. Finally, we discuss the main challenges and opportunities for future research in LLM4Security, including the need for more interpretable and explainable models, the importance of addressing data privacy and security concerns, and the potential for leveraging LLMs for proactive defense and threat hunting. Overall, our survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in LLM4Security and identifies several promising directions for future research.",

    "summary": "Web applications and APIs face constant threats from malicious actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities for illicit gains. To defend against these threats, it is essential to have anomaly detection systems that can identify a variety of malicious behaviors. However, a significant challenge in this area is the limited availability of training data. Existing datasets often do not provide sufficient coverage of the diverse API structures, parameter formats, and usage patterns encountered in real-world scenarios. As a result, models trained on these datasets often struggle to generalize and may fail to detect less common or emerging attack vectors. To enhance detection accuracy and robustness, it is crucial to access larger and more representative datasets that capture the true variability of API traffic. To address this, we introduce a GAN-inspired learning framework that extends limited API traffic datasets through targeted, domain-aware synthesis. Drawing on techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP), our approach leverages Transformer-based architectures, particularly RoBERTa, to enhance the contextual representation of API requests and generate realistic synthetic samples aligned with security-specific semantics. We evaluate our framework on two benchmark datasets, CSIC 2010 and ATRDF 2023, and compare it with a previous data augmentation technique to assess the importance of domain-specific synthesis. In addition, we apply our augmented data to various anomaly detection models to evaluate its impact on classification performance. Our method achieves up to a 4.94% increase in F1 score on CSIC 2010 and up to 21.10% on ATRDF 2023. The source codes of this work are available at this https URL.",

    "summary": "RowHammer vulnerabilities pose a significant threat to modern DRAM-based systems, where rapid activation of DRAM rows can induce bit-flips in neighboring rows. To mitigate this, state-of-the-art host-side RowHammer mitigations typically rely on shared counters or tracking structures. While these optimizations benefit benign applications, they are vulnerable to Performance Attacks (Perf-Attacks), where adversaries exploit shared structures to reduce DRAM bandwidth for co-running benign applications by increasing DRAM accesses for RowHammer counters or triggering repetitive refreshes required for the early reset of structures, significantly degrading performance.\nIn this paper, we propose secure hashing mechanisms to thwart adversarial attempts to capture the mapping of shared structures. We propose DAPPER, a novel low-cost tracker resilient to Perf-Attacks even at ultra-low RowHammer thresholds. We first present a secure hashing template in the form of DAPPER-S. We then develop DAPPER-H, an enhanced version of DAPPER-S, incorporating double-hashing, novel reset strategies, and mitigative refresh techniques. Our security analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of DAPPER-H against both RowHammer and Perf-Attacks. Experiments with 57 workloads from SPEC2006, SPEC2017, TPC, Hadoop, MediaBench, and YCSB show that, even at an ultra-low RowHammer threshold of 500, DAPPER-H incurs only a 0.9% slowdown in the presence of Perf-Attacks while using only 96KB of SRAM per 32GB of DRAM memory.",

    "summary": "JEDEC has introduced the Per Row Activation Counting (PRAC) framework for DDR5 and future DRAMs to enable precise counting of DRAM row activations. PRAC enables a holistic mitigation of Rowhammer attacks even at ultra-low Rowhammer thresholds. PRAC uses an Alert Back-Off (ABO) protocol to request the memory controller to issue Rowhammer mitigation requests. However, recent PRAC implementations are either insecure or impractical. For example, Panopticon, the inspiration for PRAC, is rendered insecure if implemented per JEDEC's PRAC specification. On the other hand, the recent UPRAC proposal is impractical since it needs oracular knowledge of the `top-N' activated DRAM rows that require mitigation.\nThis paper provides the first secure, scalable, and practical RowHammer solution using the PRAC framework. The crux of our proposal is the design of a priority-based service queue (PSQ) for mitigations that prioritizes pending mitigations based on activation counts to avoid the security risks of prior solutions. This provides principled security using the reactive ABO protocol. Furthermore, we co-design our PSQ, with opportunistic mitigation on Refresh Management (RFM) operations and proactive mitigation during refresh (REF), to limit the performance impact of ABO-based mitigations. QPRAC provides secure and practical RowHammer mitigation that scales to Rowhammer thresholds as low as 71 while incurring a 0.8% slowdown for benign workloads, which further reduces to 0% with proactive mitigations.",

    "summary": "The Spectre speculative side-channel attacks pose formidable threats for security. Research has shown that code following the cryptographic constant-time discipline can be efficiently protected against Spectre v1 using a selective variant of Speculative Load Hardening (SLH). SLH was, however, not strong enough for protecting non-cryptographic code, leading to the introduction of Ultimate SLH, which provides protection for arbitrary programs, but has too large overhead for general use, since it conservatively assumes that all data is secret. In this paper we introduce a flexible SLH notion that achieves the best of both worlds by generalizing both Selective and Ultimate SLH. We give a suitable security definition for such transformations protecting arbitrary programs: any transformed program running with speculation should not leak more than what the source program leaks sequentially. We formally prove using the Rocq prover that two flexible SLH variants enforce this relative security guarantee. As easy corollaries we also obtain that, in our setting, Ultimate SLH enforces our relative security notion, and two selective SLH variants enforce speculative constant-time security.",

With growing regulatory pressure to address these issues through greater transparency, ML model vendors face challenges balancing these requirements against confidentiality for data and intellectual property needs. We propose Atlas, a framework that enables fully attestable ML pipelines. Atlas leverages open specifications for data and software supply chain provenance to collect verifiable records of model artifact authenticity and end-to-end lineage metadata. Atlas combines trusted hardware and transparency logs to enhance metadata integrity, preserve data confidentiality, and limit unauthorized access during ML pipeline operations, from training through deployment.

    "summary": "The increasing availability of drones and their potential for malicious activities pose significant privacy and security risks, necessitating fast and reliable detection in real-world environments. However, existing drone detection systems often struggle in real-world settings due to environmental noise and sensor limitations. This paper introduces TRIDENT, a tri-modal drone detection framework that integrates synchronized audio, visual, and RF data to enhance robustness and reduce dependence on individual sensors. TRIDENT introduces two fusion strategies - Late Fusion and GMU Fusion - to improve multi-modal integration while maintaining efficiency. The framework incorporates domain-specific feature extraction techniques alongside a specialized data augmentation pipeline that simulates real-world sensor degradation to improve generalization capabilities. A diverse multi-sensor dataset is collected in urban and non-urban environments under varying lighting conditions, ensuring comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results show that TRIDENT achieves 98.8 percent accuracy in real-world recordings and 83.26 percent in a more complex setting (augmented data), outperforming unimodal and dual-modal baselines. Moreover, TRIDENT operates in real-time, detecting drones in just 6.09 ms while consuming only 75.27 mJ per detection, making it highly efficient for resource-constrained devices. The dataset and code have been released to ensure reproducibility (this https URL).",

    "summary": "The implementation of security protocols often combines different languages. This practice, however, poses a challenge to traditional verification techniques, which typically assume a single-language environment and, therefore, are insufficient to handle challenges presented by the interplay of different languages. To address this issue, we establish principles for combining multiple programming languages operating on different atomic types using a symbolic execution semantics. This facilitates the (parallel) composition of labeled transition systems, improving the analysis of complex systems by streamlining communication between diverse programming languages. By treating the Dolev-Yao (DY) model as a symbolic abstraction, our approach eliminates the need for translation between different base types, such as bitstrings and DY terms. Our technique provides a foundation for securing interactions in multi-language environments, enhancing program verification and system analysis in complex, interconnected systems.",

    "summary": "This work presents a joint design of encoding and encryption procedures for public key encryptions (PKEs) and key encapsulation mechanism (KEMs) such as Kyber, without relying on the assumption of independent decoding noise components, achieving reductions in both communication overhead (CER) and decryption failure rate (DFR). Our design features two techniques: ciphertext packing and lattice packing. First, we extend the Peikert-Vaikuntanathan-Waters (PVW) method to Kyber: $\\ell$ plaintexts are packed into a single ciphertext. This scheme is referred to as P$_\\ell$-Kyber. We prove that the P$_\\ell$-Kyber is IND-CCA secure under the M-LWE hardness assumption. We show that the decryption decoding noise entries across the $\\ell$ plaintexts (also known as layers) are mutually independent. Second, we propose a cross-layer lattice encoding scheme for the P$_\\ell$-Kyber, where every $\\ell$ cross-layer information symbols are encoded to a lattice point. This way we obtain a \\emph{coded} P$_\\ell$-Kyber, where the decoding noise entries for each lattice point are mutually independent. Therefore, the DFR analysis does not require the assumption of independence among the decryption decoding noise entries. Both DFR and CER are greatly decreased thanks to ciphertext packing and lattice packing. We demonstrate that with $\\ell=24$ and Leech lattice encoder, the proposed coded P$_\\ell$-KYBER1024 achieves DFR $<2^{-281}$ and CER $ = 4.6$, i.e., a decrease of CER by $90\\%$ compared to KYBER1024.",

However, despite their widespread deployment in inference services such as ChatGPT, concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive user data have arisen. Existing solutions primarily rely on privacy-enhancing technologies to mitigate such risks, facing the trade-off among efficiency, privacy, and utility. To narrow this gap, we propose Cape, a context-aware prompt perturbation mechanism based on differential privacy, to enable efficient inference with an improved privacy-utility trade-off. Concretely, we introduce a hybrid utility function that better captures the token similarity. Additionally, we propose a bucketized sampling mechanism to handle large sampling space, which might lead to long-tail phenomenons. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, along with ablation studies, demonstrate that Cape achieves a better privacy-utility trade-off compared to prior state-of-the-art works.",

We find that the study of such a model sheds light on several aspects of the notion of quantum pseudorandomness.\nPseudorandom states (PRS) are a family of states for which it is hard to distinguish between polynomially many copies of either a state sampled uniformly from the family or a Haar random state. A weaker notion, called single-copy pseudorandom states (1PRS), satisfies this property with respect to a single copy. We obtain the following results:\n1. First, we show, perhaps surprisingly, that 1PRS (as well as bit-commitments) exist relative to an oracle that provides a single Haar random state.\n2. Second, we build on this result to show the existence of an isometry oracle relative to which 1PRS exist, but PRS do not.\nTaken together, our contributions yield one of the first black-box separations between central notions of quantum pseudorandomness, and introduce a new framework to study black-box separations between various inherently quantum primitives.",

Previous work has presented differentially private algorithms for many graph problems that can handle insertions only or deletions only (called partially dynamic algorithms) and obtained some hardness results for the fully dynamic setting. The only algorithms in the latter setting were for the edge count, given by Fichtenberger, Henzinger, and Ost (ESA 21), and for releasing the values of all graph cuts, given by Fichtenberger, Henzinger, and Upadhyay (ICML 23). We provide the first differentially private and fully dynamic graph algorithms for several other fundamental graph statistics (including the triangle count, the number of connected components, the size of the maximum matching, and the degree histogram), analyze their error and show strong lower bounds on the error for all algorithms in this setting. We study two variants of edge differential privacy for fully dynamic graph algorithms: event-level and item-level. We give upper and lower bounds on the error of both event-level and item-level fully dynamic algorithms for several fundamental graph problems. No fully dynamic algorithms that are private at the item-level (the more stringent of the two notions) were known before. In the case of item-level privacy, for several problems, our algorithms match our lower bounds.",

Despite reducing the enclave loading time by 28--93%, straightforward EDMM adoption strategies actually slow execution time down by as much as 58%. Using the Gramine library OS as a representative enclave runtime environment, this paper shows how to recover EDMM performance. The paper explains how implementing mutual distrust between the OS and enclave increases the cost of modifying page mappings.

    "summary": "The left atrium (LA) plays a pivotal role in modulating left ventricular filling, but our comprehension of its hemodynamics is significantly limited by the constraints of conventional ultrasound analysis. 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (4D Flow MRI) holds promise for enhancing our understanding of atrial hemodynamics. However, the low velocities within the LA and the limited spatial resolution of 4D Flow MRI make analyzing this chamber challenging. Furthermore, the absence of dedicated computational frameworks, combined with diverse acquisition protocols and vendors, complicates gathering large cohorts for studying the prognostic value of hemodynamic parameters provided by 4D Flow MRI. In this study, we introduce the first open-source computational framework tailored for the analysis of 4D Flow MRI in the LA, enabling comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis of advanced hemodynamic parameters. Our framework proves robust to data from different centers of varying quality, producing high-accuracy automated segmentations (Dice $>$ 0.9 and Hausdorff 95 $<$ 3 mm), even with limited training data. Additionally, we conducted the first comprehensive assessment of energy, vorticity, and pressure parameters in the LA across a spectrum of disorders to investigate their potential as prognostic biomarkers.",

    "summary": "Generating realistic dyadic human motion from text descriptions presents significant challenges, particularly for extended interactions that exceed typical training sequence lengths. While recent transformer-based approaches have shown promising results for short-term dyadic motion synthesis, they struggle with longer sequences due to inherent limitations in positional encoding schemes. In this paper, we introduce Dyadic Mamba, a novel approach that leverages State-Space Models (SSMs) to generate high-quality dyadic human motion of arbitrary length. Our method employs a simple yet effective architecture that facilitates information flow between individual motion sequences through concatenation, eliminating the need for complex cross-attention mechanisms. We demonstrate that Dyadic Mamba achieves competitive performance on standard short-term benchmarks while significantly outperforming transformer-based approaches on longer sequences. Additionally, we propose a new benchmark for evaluating long-term motion synthesis quality, providing a standardized framework for future research. Our results demonstrate that SSM-based architectures offer a promising direction for addressing the challenging task of long-term dyadic human motion synthesis from text descriptions.",

    "summary": "Obtaining large-scale medical data, annotated or unannotated, is challenging due to stringent privacy regulations and data protection policies. In addition, annotating medical images requires that domain experts manually delineate anatomical structures, making the process both time-consuming and costly. As a result, semi-supervised methods have gained popularity for reducing annotation costs. However, the performance of semi-supervised methods is heavily dependent on the availability of unannotated data, and their effectiveness declines when such data are scarce or absent. To overcome this limitation, we propose a simple, yet effective and computationally efficient approach for medical image segmentation that leverages only existing annotations. We propose BoundarySeg , a multi-task framework that incorporates organ boundary prediction as an auxiliary task to full organ segmentation, leveraging consistency between the two task predictions to provide additional supervision. This strategy improves segmentation accuracy, especially in low data regimes, allowing our method to achieve performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art semi supervised approaches all without relying on unannotated data or increasing computational demands. Code will be released upon acceptance.",

    "summary": "Computer-assisted interventions can improve intra-operative guidance, particularly through deep learning methods that harness the spatiotemporal information in surgical videos. However, the severe data imbalance often found in surgical video datasets hinders the development of high-performing models. In this work, we aim to overcome the data imbalance by synthesizing surgical videos. We propose a unique two-stage, text-conditioned diffusion-based method to generate high-fidelity surgical videos for under-represented classes. Our approach conditions the generation process on text prompts and decouples spatial and temporal modeling by utilizing a 2D latent diffusion model to capture spatial content and then integrating temporal attention layers to ensure temporal consistency. Furthermore, we introduce a rejection sampling strategy to select the most suitable synthetic samples, effectively augmenting existing datasets to address class imbalance. We evaluate our method on two downstream tasks-surgical action recognition and intra-operative event prediction-demonstrating that incorporating synthetic videos from our approach substantially enhances model performance.

    "summary": "The ability to learn new visual concepts from limited examples is a hallmark of human cognition. While traditional category learning models represent each example as an unstructured feature vector, compositional concept learning is thought to depend on (1) structured representations of examples (e.g., directed graphs consisting of objects and their relations) and (2) the identification of shared relational structure across examples through analogical mapping. Here, we introduce Probabilistic Schema Induction (PSI), a prototype model that employs deep learning to perform analogical mapping over structured representations of only a handful of examples, forming a compositional concept called a schema. In doing so, PSI relies on a novel conception of similarity that weighs object-level similarity and relational similarity, as well as a mechanism for amplifying relations relevant to classification, analogous to selective attention parameters in traditional models. We show that PSI produces human-like learning performance and outperforms two controls: a prototype model that uses unstructured feature vectors extracted from a deep learning model, and a variant of PSI with weaker structured representations. Notably, we find that PSI's human-like performance is driven by an adaptive strategy that increases relational similarity over object-level similarity and upweights the contribution of relations that distinguish classes. These findings suggest that structured representations and analogical mapping are critical to modeling rapid human-like learning of compositional visual concepts, and demonstrate how deep learning can be leveraged to create psychological models.",

    "summary": "The recently developed Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown encouraging and impressive results for visual SLAM. However, most representative methods require RGBD sensors and are only available for indoor environments. The robustness of reconstruction in large-scale outdoor scenarios remains unexplored. This paper introduces a large-scale 3DGS-based visual SLAM with stereo cameras, termed LSG-SLAM. The proposed LSG-SLAM employs a multi-modality strategy to estimate prior poses under large view changes. In tracking, we introduce feature-alignment warping constraints to alleviate the adverse effects of appearance similarity in rendering losses. For the scalability of large-scale scenarios, we introduce continuous Gaussian Splatting submaps to tackle unbounded scenes with limited memory. Loops are detected between GS submaps by place recognition and the relative pose between looped keyframes is optimized utilizing rendering and feature warping losses. After the global optimization of camera poses and Gaussian points, a structure refinement module enhances the reconstruction quality. With extensive evaluations on the EuRoc and KITTI datasets, LSG-SLAM achieves superior performance over existing Neural, 3DGS-based, and even traditional approaches. Project page: this https URL.",

    "summary": "Universal visual anomaly detection aims to identify anomalies from novel or unseen vision domains without additional fine-tuning, which is critical in open scenarios. Recent studies have demonstrated that pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP exhibit strong generalization with just zero or a few normal images. However, existing methods struggle with designing prompt templates, complex token interactions, or requiring additional fine-tuning, resulting in limited flexibility. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method called AdaptCLIP based on two key insights. First, adaptive visual and textual representations should be learned alternately rather than jointly. Second, comparative learning between query and normal image prompt should incorporate both contextual and aligned residual features, rather than relying solely on residual features. AdaptCLIP treats CLIP models as a foundational service, adding only three simple adapters, visual adapter, textual adapter, and prompt-query adapter, at its input or output ends. AdaptCLIP supports zero-/few-shot generalization across domains and possesses a training-free manner on target domains once trained on a base dataset. AdaptCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on 12 anomaly detection benchmarks from industrial and medical domains, significantly outperforming existing competitive methods. We will make the code and model of AdaptCLIP available at this https URL.",

    "summary": "Domain adaptation addresses the challenge of model performance degradation caused by domain gaps. In the typical setup for unsupervised domain adaptation, labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a target domain are used to train a target model. However, access to labeled source domain data, particularly in medical datasets, can be restricted due to privacy policies. As a result, research has increasingly shifted to source-free domain adaptation (SFDA), which requires only a pretrained model from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain data for adaptation. Existing SFDA methods often rely on domain-specific image style translation and self-supervision techniques to bridge the domain gap and train the target domain model. However, the quality of domain-specific style-translated images and pseudo-labels produced by these methods still leaves room for improvement. Moreover, training the entire model during adaptation can be inefficient under limited supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel SFDA framework to address these challenges. Specifically, to effectively mitigate the impact of domain gap in the initial training phase, we introduce preadaptation to generate a preadapted model, which serves as an initialization of target model and allows for the generation of high-quality enhanced pseudo-labels without introducing extra parameters. Additionally, we propose a data-dependent frequency prompt to more effectively translate target domain images into a source-like style. To further enhance adaptation, we employ a style-related layer fine-tuning strategy, specifically designed for SFDA, to train the target model using the prompted target domain images and pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on cross-modality abdominal and cardiac SFDA segmentation tasks demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.",

Existing methods suffer from deficiencies in the localization of dim targets and the perception of contour information under dense clutter environments, severely limiting their detection performance.

We first design a surround-convergent prior extraction module (SCPEM) that effectively captures the intrinsic characteristic of target contour pixel gradients converging toward their center. This module concurrently extracts two collaborative priors: a boosted saliency prior for accurate target localization and multi-scale structural priors for comprehensively enriching contour detail representation. Building upon this, we propose a dual-branch priors embedding architecture (DBPEA) that establishes differentiated feature fusion pathways, embedding these two priors at optimal network positions to achieve performance enhancement. Finally, we develop an attention-guided feature enhancement module (AGFEM) to refine feature representations and improve saliency estimation accuracy. Experimental results on public datasets NUDT-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and NUAA-SIRST demonstrate that our CSPENet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in detection performance.

By carefully observing facial image patterns, we identify that certain texture cues, such as micro-changes in skin around the brows, eyes, and mouth, serve as primary indicators of emotional dynamics. To effectively capture and leverage these cues, we propose a FER architecture comprising a Texture-Aware Feature Extractor (TAFE) and Dual Contextual Information Filtering (DCIF).

    "summary": "Airborne laser scanning (ALS) point cloud segmentation is a fundamental task for large-scale 3D scene understanding. In real-world applications, models are typically fixed after training. However, domain shifts caused by changes in the environment, sensor types, or sensor degradation often lead to a decline in model performance. Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) offers a solution by adapting a source-pretrained model to evolving, unlabeled target domains. Despite its potential, research on ALS point clouds remains limited, facing challenges such as the absence of standardized datasets and the risk of catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation during prolonged adaptation. To tackle these challenges, we propose APCoTTA, the first CTTA method tailored for ALS point cloud semantic segmentation. We propose a dynamic trainable layer selection module. This module utilizes gradient information to select low-confidence layers for training, and the remaining layers are kept frozen, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. To further reduce error accumulation, we propose an entropy-based consistency loss. By losing such samples based on entropy, we apply consistency loss only to the reliable samples, enhancing model stability. In addition, we propose a random parameter interpolation mechanism, which randomly blends parameters from the selected trainable layers with those of the source model. This approach helps balance target adaptation and source knowledge retention, further alleviating forgetting. Finally, we construct two benchmarks, ISPRSC and H3DC, to address the lack of CTTA benchmarks for ALS point cloud segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that APCoTTA achieves the best performance on two benchmarks, with mIoU improvements of approximately 9% and 14% over direct inference.

HQUIC employs an ALTC module to adaptively predict the attenuation coefficients and global light information of the images, which effectively mitigates the issues caused by the differences in lighting and tone existing in underwater images. Subsequently, HQUIC employs a codebook as an auxiliary branch to extract the common objects within underwater images and enhances the performance of the main branch. Furthermore, HQUIC dynamically weights multi-scale frequency components, prioritizing information critical for distortion quality while discarding redundant details. Extensive evaluations on diverse underwater datasets demonstrate that HQUIC outperforms state-of-the-art compression methods.",

    "summary": "Pointing serves as a fundamental and intuitive mechanism for grounding language within visual contexts, with applications spanning robotics, assistive technologies, and interactive AI systems. While recent multimodal models have started to support pointing capabilities, existing benchmarks typically focus only on referential object localization tasks. We introduce PointArena, a comprehensive platform for evaluating multimodal pointing across diverse reasoning scenarios. PointArena comprises three components: (1) Point-Bench, a curated dataset containing approximately 1,000 pointing tasks across five reasoning categories; (2) Point-Battle, an interactive, web-based arena facilitating blind, pairwise model comparisons, which has already gathered over 4,500 anonymized votes; and (3) Point-Act, a real-world robotic manipulation system allowing users to directly evaluate multimodal model pointing capabilities in practical settings. We conducted extensive evaluations of both state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary multimodal models. Results indicate that Molmo-72B consistently outperforms other models, though proprietary models increasingly demonstrate comparable performance. Additionally, we find that supervised training specifically targeting pointing tasks significantly enhances model performance. Across our multi-stage evaluation pipeline, we also observe strong correlations, underscoring the critical role of precise pointing capabilities in enabling multimodal models to effectively bridge abstract reasoning with concrete, real-world actions.

    "summary": "Image-text matching aims to build correspondences between visual and textual data by learning their pairwise similarities. Most existing approaches have adopted sparse binary supervision, indicating whether a pair of images and sentences matches or not. However, such sparse supervision covers a limited subset of image-text relationships, neglecting their inherent many-to-many correspondences; an image can be described in numerous texts at different descriptive levels. Moreover, existing approaches overlook the implicit connections from general to specific descriptions, which form the underlying rationale for the many-to-many relationships between vision and language. In this work, we propose descriptive image-text matching, called DITM, to learn the graded contextual similarity between image and text by exploring the descriptive flexibility of language. We formulate the descriptiveness score of each sentence with cumulative term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to balance the pairwise similarity according to the keywords in the sentence. Our method leverages sentence descriptiveness to learn robust image-text matching in two key ways: (1) to refine the false negative labeling, dynamically relaxing the connectivity between positive and negative pairs, and (2) to build more precise matching, aligning a set of relevant sentences in a generic-to-specific order. By moving beyond rigid binary supervision, DITM enhances the discovery of both optimal matches and potential positive pairs. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO, Flickr30K, and CxC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in representing complex image-text relationships compared to state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, DITM enhances the hierarchical reasoning ability of the model, supported by the extensive analysis on HierarCaps benchmark.",

However, existing 3D garment design tools remain inaccessible to everyday users due to steep technical barriers and limited data. In this work, we introduce a 3D sketch-driven 3D garment generation framework that empowers ordinary users - even those without design experience - to create high-quality digital clothing through simple 3D sketches in AR/VR environments. By combining a conditional diffusion model, a sketch encoder trained in a shared latent space, and an adaptive curriculum learning strategy, our system interprets imprecise, free-hand input and produces realistic, personalized garments. To address the scarcity of training data, we also introduce KO3DClothes, a new dataset of paired 3D garments and user-created sketches.

While initially developed for static environments, these methodologies have rapidly evolved to address the complexities inherent in 4D dynamic scenes through an expansive body of research. Coupled with innovations in differentiable volumetric rendering, these approaches have significantly enhanced the quality of motion representation and dynamic scene reconstruction, thereby garnering substantial attention from the computer vision and graphics communities. This survey presents a systematic analysis of over 200 papers focused on dynamic scene representation using radiance field, spanning the spectrum from implicit neural representations to explicit Gaussian primitives. We categorize and evaluate these works through multiple critical lenses: motion representation paradigms, reconstruction techniques for varied scene dynamics, auxiliary information integration strategies, and regularization approaches that ensure temporal consistency and physical plausibility. We organize diverse methodological approaches under a unified representational framework, concluding with a critical examination of persistent challenges and promising research directions. By providing this comprehensive overview, we aim to establish a definitive reference for researchers entering this rapidly evolving field while offering experienced practitioners a systematic understanding of both conceptual principles and practical frontiers in dynamic scene reconstruction.",

To address this, we developed a synthetic Pashto OCR dataset, PsOCR, consisting of one million images annotated with bounding boxes at word, line, and document levels, suitable for training and evaluating models based on different architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. PsOCR covers variations across 1,000 unique font families, colors, image sizes, and layouts. A benchmark subset of 10K images was selected to evaluate the performance of several LMMs, including seven open-source models: DeepSeek's Janus, InternVL, MiniCPM, Florence, and Qwen (3B and 7B), and four closed-source models: GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude, and Grok. Experimental results demonstrate that Gemini achieves the best performance among all models, whereas among open-source models, Qwen-7B stands out. This work provides an insightful assessment of the capabilities and limitations of current LMMs for OCR tasks in Pashto and establishes a foundation for further research not only in Pashto OCR but also for other similar scripts such as Arabic, Persian, and Urdu.

Toonify, a StyleGAN-based framework, has become widely used for facial image stylization. To extend Toonify for synthesizing diverse stylized 3D head avatars using Gaussian blendshapes, we propose an efficient two-stage framework, ToonifyGB. In Stage 1 (stylized video generation), we employ an improved StyleGAN to generate the stylized video from the input video frames, which addresses the limitation of cropping aligned faces at a fixed resolution as preprocessing for normal StyleGAN. This process provides a more stable video, which enables Gaussian blendshapes to better capture the high-frequency details of the video frames, and efficiently generate high-quality animation in the next stage. In Stage 2 (Gaussian blendshapes synthesis), we learn a stylized neutral head model and a set of expression blendshapes from the generated video. By combining the neutral head model with expression blendshapes, ToonifyGB can efficiently render stylized avatars with arbitrary expressions. We validate the effectiveness of ToonifyGB on the benchmark dataset using two styles: Arcane and Pixar.",

    "summary": "Large-scale pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly advanced transfer learning across diverse tasks. However, adapting these models with limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting, undermining their ability to generalize to new tasks. To address this, we propose Multi-Modal Representation Learning (MMRL), which introduces a shared, learnable, modality-agnostic representation space. MMRL generates space tokens projected into both text and image encoders as representation tokens, enabling more effective cross-modal interactions. Unlike prior methods that mainly optimize class token features, MMRL inserts representation tokens into higher encoder layers--where task-specific features are more prominent--while preserving general knowledge in the lower layers. During training, both class and representation features are jointly optimized: a trainable projection layer is applied to representation tokens for task adaptation, while the projection layer for class token remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. To further promote generalization, we introduce a regularization term aligning class and text features with the frozen VLM's zero-shot features. At inference, a decoupling strategy uses both class and representation features for base tasks, but only class features for novel tasks due to their stronger generalization. Building upon this, we propose MMRL++, a parameter-efficient and interaction-aware extension that significantly reduces trainable parameters and enhances intra-modal interactions--particularly across the layers of representation tokens--allowing gradient sharing and instance-specific information to propagate more effectively through the network. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets demonstrate that MMRL and MMRL++ consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods, achieving a strong balance between task-specific adaptation and generalization.",

    "summary": "Existing visual token pruning methods target prompt alignment and visual preservation with static strategies, overlooking the varying relative importance of these objectives across tasks, which leads to inconsistent performance. To address this, we derive the first closed-form error bound for visual token pruning based on the Hausdorff distance, uniformly characterizing the contributions of both objectives. Moreover, leveraging $\\epsilon$-covering theory, we reveal an intrinsic trade-off between these objectives and quantify their optimal attainment levels under a fixed budget. To practically handle this trade-off, we propose Multi-Objective Balanced Covering (MoB), which reformulates visual token pruning as a bi-objective covering problem. In this framework, the attainment trade-off reduces to budget allocation via greedy radius trading. MoB offers a provable performance bound and linear scalability with respect to the number of input visual tokens, enabling adaptation to challenging pruning scenarios. Extensive experiments show that MoB preserves 96.4% of performance for LLaVA-1.5-7B using only 11.1% of the original visual tokens and accelerates LLaVA-Next-7B by 1.3-1.5$\\times$ with negligible performance loss. Additionally, evaluations on Qwen2-VL and Video-LLaVA confirm that MoB integrates seamlessly into advanced MLLMs and diverse vision-language tasks.",

We show how to practically model this formalism by using a new conditional U-Net architecture, which fully takes into account the conditional information and does not need any fixed image. Our formalism is then applied to image moving tumors for radiotherapy treatment at different breathing amplitude using 4D-CT (3D+t) scans in thoracoabdominal regions. This driving application is particularly complex as it requires to stitch a collection of sequential 2D slices into several 3D volumes at different organ positions. Movement interpolation with standard methods then generates well known reconstruction artefacts in the assembled volumes due to irregular patient breathing, hysteresis and poor correlation of breathing signal to internal motion. Results obtained on 4D-CT clinical data showcase artefact-free volumes achieved through real-time latencies. The code is publicly available at this https URL .",

    "summary": "Federated domain generalization aims to learn a generalizable model from multiple decentralized source domains for deploying on the unseen target domain. The style augmentation methods have achieved great progress on domain generalization. However, the existing style augmentation methods either explore the data styles within isolated source domain or interpolate the style information across existing source domains under the data decentralization scenario, which leads to limited style space. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-source Collaborative Style Augmentation and Domain-invariant learning method (MCSAD) for federated domain generalization. Specifically, we propose a multi-source collaborative style augmentation module to generate data in the broader style space. Furthermore, we conduct domain-invariant learning between the original data and augmented data by cross-domain feature alignment within the same class and classes relation ensemble distillation between different classes to learn a domain-invariant model. By alternatively conducting collaborative style augmentation and domain-invariant learning, the model can generalize well on unseen target domain. Extensive experiments on multiple domain generalization datasets indicate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated domain generalization methods.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in image-based saliency prediction are approaching gold standard performance levels on existing benchmarks. Despite this success, we show that predicting fixations across multiple saliency datasets remains challenging due to dataset bias. We find a significant performance drop (around 40%) when models trained on one dataset are applied to another. Surprisingly, increasing dataset diversity does not resolve this inter-dataset gap, with close to 60% attributed to dataset-specific biases. To address this remaining generalization gap, we propose a novel architecture extending a mostly dataset-agnostic encoder-decoder structure with fewer than 20 dataset-specific parameters that govern interpretable mechanisms such as multi-scale structure, center bias, and fixation spread. Adapting only these parameters to new data accounts for more than 75% of the generalization gap, with a large fraction of the improvement achieved with as few as 50 samples. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art on all three datasets of the MIT/Tuebingen Saliency Benchmark (MIT300, CAT2000, and COCO-Freeview), even when purely generalizing from unrelated datasets, but with a substantial boost when adapting to the respective training datasets. The model also provides valuable insights into spatial saliency properties, revealing complex multi-scale effects that combine both absolute and relative sizes.",

In this paper, we present VolE, a novel framework that leverages mobile device-driven 3D reconstruction to estimate food volume. VolE captures images and camera locations in free motion to generate precise 3D models, thanks to AR-capable mobile devices. To achieve real-world measurement, VolE is a reference- and depth-free framework that leverages food video segmentation for food mask generation. We also introduce a new food dataset encompassing the challenging scenarios absent in the previous benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that VolE outperforms the existing volume estimation techniques across multiple datasets by achieving 2.22 % MAPE, highlighting its superior performance in food volume estimation.",

    "summary": "Medical image segmentation models are often trained on curated datasets, leading to performance degradation when deployed in real-world clinical settings due to mismatches between training and test distributions. While data augmentation techniques are widely used to address these challenges, traditional visually consistent augmentation strategies lack the robustness needed for diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we systematically evaluate alternative augmentation strategies, focusing on MixUp and Auxiliary Fourier Augmentation. These methods mitigate the effects of multiple variations without explicitly targeting specific sources of distribution shifts. We demonstrate how these techniques significantly improve out-of-distribution generalization and robustness to imaging variations across a wide range of transformations in cardiac cine MRI and prostate MRI segmentation. We quantitatively find that these augmentation methods enhance learned feature representations by promoting separability and compactness. Additionally, we highlight how their integration into nnU-Net training pipelines provides an easy-to-implement, effective solution for enhancing the reliability of medical segmentation models in real-world applications.",

    "summary": "Human image animation has gained increasing attention and developed rapidly due to its broad applications in digital humans. However, existing methods rely largely on 2D-rendered pose images for motion guidance, which limits generalization and discards essential 3D information for open-world animation. To tackle this problem, we propose MTVCrafter (Motion Tokenization Video Crafter), the first framework that directly models raw 3D motion sequences (i.e., 4D motion) for human image animation. Specifically, we introduce 4DMoT (4D motion tokenizer) to quantize 3D motion sequences into 4D motion tokens. Compared to 2D-rendered pose images, 4D motion tokens offer more robust spatio-temporal cues and avoid strict pixel-level alignment between pose image and character, enabling more flexible and disentangled control. Then, we introduce MV-DiT (Motion-aware Video DiT). By designing unique motion attention with 4D positional encodings, MV-DiT can effectively leverage motion tokens as 4D compact yet expressive context for human image animation in the complex 3D world. Hence, it marks a significant step forward in this field and opens a new direction for pose-guided human video generation. Experiments show that our MTVCrafter achieves state-of-the-art results with an FID-VID of 6.98, surpassing the second-best by 65%. Powered by robust motion tokens, MTVCrafter also generalizes well to diverse open-world characters (single/multiple, full/half-body) across various styles and scenarios.

Probabilistic methods have tried to solve this by generating numerous plausible 3D human mesh predictions, but they often exhibit misalignment with 2D image observations and weak robustness to in-the-wild images. To address these issues, we propose ADHMR, a framework that Aligns a Diffusion-based HMR model in a preference optimization manner. First, we train a human mesh prediction assessment model, HMR-Scorer, capable of evaluating predictions even for in-the-wild images without 3D annotations. We then use HMR-Scorer to create a preference dataset, where each input image has a pair of winner and loser mesh predictions. This dataset is used to finetune the base model using direct preference optimization. Moreover, HMR-Scorer also helps improve existing HMR models by data cleaning, even with fewer training samples. Extensive experiments show that ADHMR outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at: this https URL.",

To avoid extensive efforts from manual labeling, methods for automating the map creation have emerged. Recent trends have moved from offline mapping to online mapping, ensuring availability and actuality of the utilized maps. While the performance has increased in recent years, online mapping still faces challenges regarding temporal consistency, sensor occlusion, runtime, and generalization. We propose a novel offline mapping approach that integrates trails - informal routes used by drivers - into the map creation process. Our method aggregates trail data from the ego vehicle and other traffic participants to construct a comprehensive global map using transformer-based deep learning models. Unlike traditional offline mapping, our approach enables continuous updates while remaining sensor-agnostic, facilitating efficient data transfer. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art online mapping approaches, achieving improved generalization to previously unseen environments and sensor configurations. We validate our approach on two benchmark datasets, highlighting its robustness and applicability in autonomous driving systems.",

HandReader$_{RGB}$ employs the novel Temporal Shift-Adaptive Module (TSAM) to process RGB features from videos of varying lengths while preserving important sequential information. HandReader$_{KP}$ is built on the proposed Temporal Pose Encoder (TPE) operated on keypoints as tensors. Such keypoints composition in a batch allows the encoder to pass them through 2D and 3D convolution layers, utilizing temporal and spatial information and accumulating keypoints coordinates. We also introduce HandReader_RGB+KP - architecture with a joint encoder to benefit from RGB and keypoint modalities. Each HandReader model possesses distinct advantages and achieves state-of-the-art results on the ChicagoFSWild and ChicagoFSWild+ datasets.

Specifically, we design two self-adaptive aggregators to extract local information from low-level visual features and integrate global information from high-level visual features, respectively. These key information are progressively incorporated into textual representations through a stage-by-stage interaction mechanism, significantly enhancing the model's perception capability for fine-grained local visual information. Additionally, MSCI dynamically adjusts the attention weights between global and local visual information based on different combinations, as well as different elements within the same combination, allowing it to flexibly adapt to diverse scenarios.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MIPHEI (Multiplex Immunofluorescence Prediction from H&E), a U-Net-inspired architecture that integrates state-of-the-art ViT foundation models as encoders to predict mIF signals from H&E images. MIPHEI targets a comprehensive panel of markers spanning nuclear content, immune lineages (T cells, B cells, myeloid), epithelium, stroma, vasculature, and proliferation. We train our model using the publicly available ORION dataset of restained H&E and mIF images from colorectal cancer tissue, and validate it on two independent datasets. MIPHEI achieves accurate cell-type classification from H&E alone, with F1 scores of 0.88 for Pan-CK, 0.57 for CD3e, 0.56 for SMA, 0.36 for CD68, and 0.30 for CD20, substantially outperforming both a state-of-the-art baseline and a random classifier for most markers. Our results indicate that our model effectively captures the complex relationships between nuclear morphologies in their tissue context, as visible in H&E images and molecular markers defining specific cell types. MIPHEI offers a promising step toward enabling cell-type-aware analysis of large-scale H&E datasets, in view of uncovering relationships between spatial cellular organization and patient outcomes.",

    "summary": "Self-supervised learning shows promise in harnessing extensive unlabeled data, but it also confronts significant privacy concerns, especially in vision. In this paper, we perform membership inference on visual self-supervised models in a more realistic setting: self-supervised training method and details are unknown for an adversary when attacking as he usually faces a black-box system in practice. In this setting, considering that self-supervised model could be trained by completely different self-supervised paradigms, e.g., masked image modeling and contrastive learning, with complex training details, we propose a unified membership inference method called PartCrop. It is motivated by the shared part-aware capability among models and stronger part response on the training data. Specifically, PartCrop crops parts of objects in an image to query responses within the image in representation space. We conduct extensive attacks on self-supervised models with different training protocols and structures using three widely used image datasets. The results verify the effectiveness and generalization of PartCrop. Moreover, to defend against PartCrop, we evaluate two common approaches, i.e., early stop and differential privacy, and propose a tailored method called shrinking crop scale range. The defense experiments indicate that all of them are effective. Finally, besides prototype testing on toy visual encoders and small-scale image datasets, we quantitatively study the impacts of scaling from both data and model aspects in a realistic scenario and propose a scalable PartCrop-v2 by introducing two structural improvements to PartCrop.

    "summary": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown competitive performance to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in various vision tasks, while offering superior energy efficiency. However, existing SNN-based Transformers primarily focus on single-image tasks, emphasizing spatial features while not effectively leveraging SNNs' efficiency in video-based vision tasks. In this paper, we introduce SpikeVideoFormer, an efficient spike-driven video Transformer, featuring linear temporal complexity $\\mathcal{O}(T)$. Specifically, we design a spike-driven Hamming attention (SDHA) which provides a theoretically guided adaptation from traditional real-valued attention to spike-driven attention. Building on SDHA, we further analyze various spike-driven space-time attention designs and identify an optimal scheme that delivers appealing performance for video tasks, while maintaining only linear temporal complexity. The generalization ability and efficiency of our model are demonstrated across diverse downstream video tasks, including classification, human pose tracking, and semantic segmentation. Empirical results show our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing SNN approaches, with over 15\\% improvement on the latter two tasks. Additionally, it matches the performance of recent ANN-based methods while offering significant efficiency gains, achieving $\\times 16$, $\\times 10$ and $\\times 5$ improvements on the three tasks. this https URL",

    "summary": "The Image Signal Processor (ISP) is a fundamental component in modern smartphone cameras responsible for conversion of RAW sensor image data to RGB images with a strong focus on perceptual quality. Recent work highlights the potential of deep learning approaches and their ability to capture details with a quality increasingly close to that of professional cameras. A difficult and costly step when developing a learned ISP is the acquisition of pixel-wise aligned paired data that maps the raw captured by a smartphone camera sensor to high-quality reference images. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing a novel training method for a learnable ISP that eliminates the need for direct correspondences between raw images and ground-truth data with matching content. Our unpaired approach employs a multi-term loss function guided by adversarial training with multiple discriminators processing feature maps from pre-trained networks to maintain content structure while learning color and texture characteristics from the target RGB dataset. Using lightweight neural network architectures suitable for mobile devices as backbones, we evaluated our method on the Zurich RAW to RGB and Fujifilm UltraISP datasets. Compared to paired training methods, our unpaired learning strategy shows strong potential and achieves high fidelity across multiple evaluation metrics.

They are capable of performing complex semantic tasks such as automatic captioning, but it remains an open question about how well they comprehend the visuospatial properties of scenes depicted in the images they process. We argue that descriptions of virtual objects -- objects that are not visually represented in an image -- can help test scene comprehension in these AI systems. For example, an image that depicts a person standing under a tree can be paired with the following prompt: imagine that a kite is stuck in the tree. VLMs that comprehend the scene should update their representations and reason sensibly about the spatial relations between all three objects. We describe systematic evaluations of state-of-the-art VLMs and show that their ability to process virtual objects is inadequate.",

Existing methods strive for better quantity-quality performance, but lack the ability for users to intuitively adjust this trade-off to suit practical needs such as model deployment under diverse hardware and communication constraints. Here, we present ControlGS, a 3DGS optimization method that achieves semantically meaningful and cross-scene consistent quantity-quality control while maintaining strong quantity-quality performance. Through a single training run using a fixed setup and a user-specified hyperparameter reflecting quantity-quality preference, ControlGS can automatically find desirable quantity-quality trade-off points across diverse scenes, from compact objects to large outdoor scenes. It also outperforms baselines by achieving higher rendering quality with fewer Gaussians, and supports a broad adjustment range with stepless control over the trade-off.",

    "summary": "This paper examines two aspects of the isolated sign language recognition (ISLR) task. First, despite the availability of a number of datasets, the amount of data for most individual sign languages is limited. It poses the challenge of cross-language ISLR model training, including transfer learning. Second, similar signs can have different semantic meanings. It leads to ambiguity in dataset labeling and raises the question of the best policy for annotating such signs. To address these issues, this study presents Logos, a novel Russian Sign Language (RSL) dataset, the most extensive ISLR dataset by the number of signers and one of the largest available datasets while also the largest RSL dataset in size and vocabulary. It is shown that a model, pre-trained on the Logos dataset can be used as a universal encoder for other language SLR tasks, including few-shot learning. We explore cross-language transfer learning approaches and find that joint training using multiple classification heads benefits accuracy for the target lowresource datasets the most. The key feature of the Logos dataset is explicitly annotated visually similar sign groups. We show that explicitly labeling visually similar signs improves trained model quality as a visual encoder for downstream tasks. Based on the proposed contributions, we outperform current state-of-the-art results for the WLASL dataset and get competitive results for the AUTSL dataset, with a single stream model processing solely RGB video. The source code, dataset, and pre-trained models are publicly available.",

    "summary": "The emergence of unified multimodal understanding and generation models is rapidly attracting attention because of their ability to enhance instruction-following capabilities while minimizing model redundancy. However, there is a lack of a unified evaluation framework for these models, which would enable an elegant, simplified, and overall evaluation. Current models conduct evaluations on multiple task-specific benchmarks, but there are significant limitations, such as the lack of overall results, errors from extra evaluation models, reliance on extensive labeled images, benchmarks that lack diversity, and metrics with limited capacity for instruction-following evaluation. To tackle these challenges, we introduce UniEval, the first evaluation framework designed for unified multimodal models without extra models, images, or annotations. This facilitates a simplified and unified evaluation process. The UniEval framework contains a holistic benchmark, UniBench (supports both unified and visual generation models), along with the corresponding UniScore metric. UniBench includes 81 fine-grained tags contributing to high diversity. Experimental results indicate that UniBench is more challenging than existing benchmarks, and UniScore aligns closely with human evaluations, surpassing current metrics. Moreover, we extensively evaluated SoTA unified and visual generation models, uncovering new insights into Univeral's unique values.",

Our method modifies the classification task by introducing a dual-branch classification strategy that effectively handles the ambiguity in the labeling of face morphs. This adaptation allows the model to incorporate morph images into the training process, improving its ability to distinguish them from bona fide samples.\nOur strategy has been validated on public benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing robustness against face morphing attacks.

However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate answer correctness, overlooking whether models genuinely comprehend the visual input. To address this, we define implicit visual misunderstanding (IVM), where MLLMs provide correct answers without fully comprehending the visual input. Through our analysis, we decouple the visual and textual modalities within the causal attention module, revealing that attention distribution increasingly converges on the image associated with the correct answer as the network layers deepen. This insight leads to the introduction of a scale-agnostic metric, \\textit{attention accuracy}, and a novel benchmark for quantifying IVMs. Attention accuracy directly evaluates the model's visual understanding via internal mechanisms, remaining robust to positional biases for more reliable assessments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to finer granularities and demonstrate its effectiveness in unimodal scenarios, underscoring its versatility and generalizability.",

    "summary": "With the development of photorealistic diffusion models, models trained in part or fully on synthetic data achieve progressively better results. However, diffusion models still routinely generate images that would not exist in reality, such as a dog floating above the ground or with unrealistic texture artifacts. We define the concept of feasibility as whether attributes in a synthetic image could realistically exist in the real-world domain; synthetic images containing attributes that violate this criterion are considered infeasible. Intuitively, infeasible images are typically considered out-of-distribution; thus, training on such images is expected to hinder a model's ability to generalize to real-world data, and they should therefore be excluded from the training set whenever possible. However, does feasibility really matter? In this paper, we investigate whether enforcing feasibility is necessary when generating synthetic training data for CLIP-based classifiers, focusing on three target attributes: background, color, and texture. We introduce VariReal, a pipeline that minimally edits a given source image to include feasible or infeasible attributes given by the textual prompt generated by a large language model. Our experiments show that feasibility minimally affects LoRA-fine-tuned CLIP performance, with mostly less than 0.3% difference in top-1 accuracy across three fine-grained datasets. Also, the attribute matters on whether the feasible/infeasible images adversarially influence the classification performance. Finally, mixing feasible and infeasible images in training datasets does not significantly impact performance compared to using purely feasible or infeasible datasets.",

    "summary": "Existing vision tokenization isolates the optimization of vision tokenizers from downstream training, implicitly assuming the visual tokens can generalize well across various tasks, e.g., image generation and visual question answering. The vision tokenizer optimized for low-level reconstruction is agnostic to downstream tasks requiring varied representations and semantics. This decoupled paradigm introduces a critical misalignment: The loss of the vision tokenization can be the representation bottleneck for target tasks. For example, errors in tokenizing text in a given image lead to poor results when recognizing or generating them. To address this, we propose ETT, an end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning approach that enables joint optimization between vision tokenization and target autoregressive tasks. Unlike prior autoregressive models that use only discrete indices from a frozen vision tokenizer, ETT leverages the visual embeddings of the tokenizer codebook, and optimizes the vision tokenizers end-to-end with both reconstruction and caption objectives. ETT can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines with minimal architecture modifications. Our ETT is simple to implement and integrate, without the need to adjust the original codebooks or architectures of the employed large language models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed end-to-end vision tokenizer tuning unlocks significant performance gains, i.e., 2-6% for multimodal understanding and visual generation tasks compared to frozen tokenizer baselines, while preserving the original reconstruction capability. We hope this very simple and strong method can empower multimodal foundation models besides image generation and understanding.",

    "summary": "This work presents Prior Depth Anything, a framework that combines incomplete but precise metric information in depth measurement with relative but complete geometric structures in depth prediction, generating accurate, dense, and detailed metric depth maps for any scene. To this end, we design a coarse-to-fine pipeline to progressively integrate the two complementary depth sources. First, we introduce pixel-level metric alignment and distance-aware weighting to pre-fill diverse metric priors by explicitly using depth prediction. It effectively narrows the domain gap between prior patterns, enhancing generalization across varying scenarios. Second, we develop a conditioned monocular depth estimation (MDE) model to refine the inherent noise of depth priors. By conditioning on the normalized pre-filled prior and prediction, the model further implicitly merges the two complementary depth sources. Our model showcases impressive zero-shot generalization across depth completion, super-resolution, and inpainting over 7 real-world datasets, matching or even surpassing previous task-specific methods. More importantly, it performs well on challenging, unseen mixed priors and enables test-time improvements by switching prediction models, providing a flexible accuracy-efficiency trade-off while evolving with advancements in MDE models.",

    "summary": "Despite significant advances in modeling image priors via diffusion models, 3D-aware image editing remains challenging, in part because the object is only specified via a single image. To tackle this challenge, we propose 3D-Fixup, a new framework for editing 2D images guided by learned 3D priors. The framework supports difficult editing situations such as object translation and 3D rotation. To achieve this, we leverage a training-based approach that harnesses the generative power of diffusion models. As video data naturally encodes real-world physical dynamics, we turn to video data for generating training data pairs, i.e., a source and a target frame. Rather than relying solely on a single trained model to infer transformations between source and target frames, we incorporate 3D guidance from an Image-to-3D model, which bridges this challenging task by explicitly projecting 2D information into 3D space. We design a data generation pipeline to ensure high-quality 3D guidance throughout training. Results show that by integrating these 3D priors, 3D-Fixup effectively supports complex, identity coherent 3D-aware edits, achieving high-quality results and advancing the application of diffusion models in realistic image manipulation.

    "summary": "Mechanistic, multicellular, agent-based models are commonly used to investigate tissue, organ, and organism-scale biology at single-cell resolution. The Cellular-Potts Model (CPM) is a powerful and popular framework for developing and interrogating these models. CPMs become computationally expensive at large space- and time- scales making application and investigation of developed models difficult. Surrogate models may allow for the accelerated evaluation of CPMs of complex biological systems. However, the stochastic nature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different model configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work, we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI surrogate of a CPM used to investigate \\textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. We describe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that define unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this classifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model surrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference configuration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational time as compared to native code execution. Our work represents a step towards the implementation of DDPMs to develop digital twins of stochastic biological systems.",

    "summary": "State-of-the-art upper limb myoelectric prostheses often use pattern recognition (PR) control systems that translate electromyography (EMG) signals into desired movements. As prosthesis movement complexity increases, users often struggle to produce sufficiently distinct EMG patterns for reliable classification. Existing training typically involves heuristic, trial-and-error user adjustments to static decoder boundaries. Goal: We introduce the Reviewer, a 3D visual interface projecting EMG signals directly into the decoder's classification space, providing intuitive, real-time insight into PR algorithm behavior. This structured feedback reduces cognitive load and fosters mutual, data-driven adaptation between user-generated EMG patterns and decoder boundaries. Methods: A 10-session study with 12 able-bodied participants compared PR performance after motor-based training and updating using the Reviewer versus conventional virtual arm visualization. Performance was assessed using a Fitts law task that involved the aperture of the cursor and the control of orientation. Results: Participants trained with the Reviewer achieved higher completion rates, reduced overshoot, and improved path efficiency and throughput compared to the standard visualization group. Significance: The Reviewer introduces decoder-informed motor training, facilitating immediate and consistent PR-based myoelectric control improvements. By iteratively refining control through real-time feedback, this approach reduces reliance on trial-and-error recalibration, enabling a more adaptive, self-correcting training framework. Conclusion: The 3D visual feedback significantly improves PR control in novice operators through structured training, enabling feedback-driven adaptation and reducing reliance on extensive heuristic adjustments.",

    "summary": "Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is a gold standard for microscopic diagnosis in pathology. However, H&E staining does not capture all the diagnostic information that may be needed. To obtain additional molecular information, immunohistochemical (IHC) stains highlight proteins that mark specific cell types, such as CD3 for T-cells or CK8/18 for epithelial cells. While IHC stains are vital for prognosis and treatment guidance, they are typically only available at specialized centers and time consuming to acquire, leading to treatment delays for patients. Virtual staining, enabled by deep learning-based image translation models, provides a promising alternative by computationally generating IHC stains from H&E stained images. Although many GAN and diffusion based image to image (I2I) translation methods have been used for virtual staining, these models treat image patches as independent data points, which results in increased and more diverse data requirements for effective generation. We present ImplicitStainer, a novel approach that leverages local implicit functions to improve image translation, specifically virtual staining performance, by focusing on pixel-level predictions. This method enhances robustness to variations in dataset sizes, delivering high-quality results even with limited data. We validate our approach on two datasets using a comprehensive set of metrics and benchmark it against over fifteen state-of-the-art GAN- and diffusion based models.

    "summary": "Score-based diffusion models have shown significant promise in the field of sparse-view CT reconstruction. However, the projection dataset is large and riddled with redundancy. Consequently, applying the diffusion model to unprocessed data results in lower learning effectiveness and higher learning difficulty, frequently leading to reconstructed images that lack fine details. To address these issues, we propose the ordered-subsets multi-diffusion model (OSMM) for sparse-view CT reconstruction. The OSMM innovatively divides the CT projection data into equal subsets and employs multi-subsets diffusion model (MSDM) to learn from each subset independently. This targeted learning approach reduces complexity and enhances the reconstruction of fine details. Furthermore, the integration of one-whole diffusion model (OWDM) with complete sinogram data acts as a global information constraint, which can reduce the possibility of generating erroneous or inconsistent sinogram information. Moreover, the OSMM's unsupervised learning framework provides strong robustness and generalizability, adapting seamlessly to varying sparsity levels of CT sinograms. This ensures consistent and reliable performance across different clinical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OSMM outperforms traditional diffusion models in terms of image quality and noise resilience, offering a powerful and versatile solution for advanced CT imaging in sparse-view scenarios.",

Specifically, we consider world models that operate on RGB-D frames (RGB-D world models). As opposed to canonical approaches that handle dynamics prediction mostly implicitly and reconcile it with visual rendering in a single model, we introduce FlowDreamer, which adopts 3D scene flow as explicit motion representations. FlowDreamer first predicts 3D scene flow from past frame and action conditions with a U-Net, and then a diffusion model will predict the future frame utilizing the scene flow. FlowDreamer is trained end-to-end despite its modularized nature. We conduct experiments on 4 different benchmarks, covering both video prediction and visual planning tasks. The results demonstrate that FlowDreamer achieves better performance compared to other baseline RGB-D world models by 7% on semantic similarity, 11% on pixel quality, and 6% on success rate in various robot manipulation domains.",

    "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly become a leading technique for novel-view synthesis, providing exceptional performance through efficient software-based GPU rasterization. Its versatility enables real-time applications, including on mobile and lower-powered devices. However, 3DGS faces key challenges in virtual reality (VR): (1) temporal artifacts, such as popping during head movements, (2) projection-based distortions that result in disturbing and view-inconsistent floaters, and (3) reduced framerates when rendering large numbers of Gaussians, falling below the critical threshold for VR. Compared to desktop environments, these issues are drastically amplified by large field-of-view, constant head movements, and high resolution of head-mounted displays (HMDs). In this work, we introduce VRSplat: we combine and extend several recent advancements in 3DGS to address challenges of VR holistically. We show how the ideas of Mini-Splatting, StopThePop, and Optimal Projection can complement each other, by modifying the individual techniques and core 3DGS rasterizer. Additionally, we propose an efficient foveated rasterizer that handles focus and peripheral areas in a single GPU launch, avoiding redundant computations and improving GPU utilization. Our method also incorporates a fine-tuning step that optimizes Gaussian parameters based on StopThePop depth evaluations and Optimal Projection. We validate our method through a controlled user study with 25 participants, showing a strong preference for VRSplat over other configurations of Mini-Splatting. VRSplat is the first, systematically evaluated 3DGS approach capable of supporting modern VR applications, achieving 72+ FPS while eliminating popping and stereo-disrupting floaters.",

Experimental results demonstrate that the random sequence strategy significantly improves classification performance, achieving an accuracy of up to 0.70 $\\pm$ 0.03 and a macro F1 score of 0.64 $\\pm$ 0.01. For that, disrupting temporal dependencies through random sequence reordering compels the model to focus on instantaneous recognition, thereby improving robustness against activity transitions.

    "summary": "Generative semantic communication (Gen-SemCom) with large artificial intelligence (AI) model promises a transformative paradigm for 6G networks, which reduces communication costs by transmitting low-dimensional prompts rather than raw data. However, purely prompt-driven generation loses fine-grained visual details. Additionally, there is a lack of systematic metrics to evaluate the performance of Gen-SemCom systems. To address these issues, we develop a hybrid Gen-SemCom system with a critical information embedding (CIE) framework, where both text prompts and semantically critical features are extracted for transmissions. First, a novel approach of semantic filtering is proposed to select and transmit the semantically critical features of images relevant to semantic label. By integrating the text prompt and critical features, the receiver reconstructs high-fidelity images using a diffusion-based generative model. Next, we propose the generative visual information fidelity (GVIF) metric to evaluate the visual quality of the generated image. By characterizing the statistical models of image features, the GVIF metric quantifies the mutual information between the distorted features and their original counterparts. By maximizing the GVIF metric, we design a channel-adaptive Gen-SemCom system that adaptively control the volume of features and compression rate according to the channel state. Experimental results validate the GVIF metric's sensitivity to visual fidelity, correlating with both the PSNR and critical information volume. In addition, the optimized system achieves superior performance over benchmarking schemes in terms of higher PSNR and lower FID scores.",

This setting poses a key challenge: balancing plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (preserving past knowledge). Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a branch of AutoML, automates the design of the architecture of Deep Neural Networks and has shown success in static settings. However, existing NAS-based approaches to incremental learning often rely on expanding the model at every task, making them impractical in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we introduce SEAL, a NAS-based framework tailored for data-incremental learning, a scenario where disjoint data samples arrive sequentially and are not stored for future access. SEAL adapts the model structure dynamically by expanding it only when necessary, based on a capacity estimation metric. Stability is preserved through cross-distillation training after each expansion step. The NAS component jointly searches for both the architecture and the optimal expansion policy. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SEAL effectively reduces forgetting and enhances accuracy while maintaining a lower model size compared to prior methods. These results highlight the promise of combining NAS and selective expansion for efficient, adaptive learning in incremental scenarios.",

    "summary": "Multimodal medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in the context of gastric cancer lesion analysis. This clinical context is defined by the scarcity of independent multimodal datasets and the imperative to amalgamate inherently misaligned modalities. As a result, algorithms are constrained to train on approximate data and depend on application migration, leading to substantial resource expenditure and a potential decline in analysis accuracy. To address those challenges, we have made two major contributions: First, we publicly disseminate the GCM 2025 dataset, which serves as the first large-scale, open-source collection of gastric cancer multimodal MRI scans, featuring professionally annotated FS-T2W, CE-T1W, and ADC images from 500 patients. Second, we introduce HWA-UNETR, a novel 3D segmentation framework that employs an original HWA block with learnable window aggregation layers to establish dynamic feature correspondences between different modalities' anatomical structures, and leverages the innovative tri-orientated fusion mamba mechanism for context modeling and capturing long-range spatial dependencies. Extensive experiments on our GCM 2025 dataset and the publicly BraTS 2021 dataset validate the performance of our framework, demonstrating that the new approach surpasses existing methods by up to 1.68\\% in the Dice score while maintaining solid robustness.

Most applications involve identifying visual abnormalities in tissue color, texture, and shape. Unfortunately, the contrast of these features is often subtle, causing many clinically relevant cases to go undetected. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Multi-contrast Laser Endoscopy (MLE): a platform for widefield clinical imaging with rapidly tunable spectral, coherent, and directional illumination. We demonstrate three capabilities of MLE: enhancing tissue chromophore contrast with multispectral diffuse reflectance, quantifying blood flow using laser speckle contrast imaging, and characterizing mucosal topography using photometric stereo. We validate MLE with benchtop models, then demonstrate MLE in vivo during clinical colonoscopies. MLE images from 31 polyps demonstrate an approximate three-fold improvement in contrast and a five-fold improvement in color difference compared to white light and narrow band imaging. With the ability to reveal multiple complementary types of tissue contrast while seamlessly integrating into the clinical environment, MLE shows promise as an investigative tool to improve gastrointestinal imaging.",

In this paper, we propose MuToR, a simple and effective approach to multi-token prediction that interleaves learnable register tokens into the input sequence, each tasked with predicting future targets. Compared to existing methods, MuToR offers several key advantages: it introduces only a negligible number of additional parameters, requires no architectural changes--ensuring compatibility with off-the-shelf pretrained language models--and remains aligned with the next-token pretraining objective, making it especially well-suited for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover, it naturally supports scalable prediction horizons. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of MuToR across a range of use cases, including supervised fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and pretraining, on challenging generative tasks in both language and vision domains.

    "summary": "Speculative decoding significantly accelerates language model inference by enabling a lightweight draft model to propose multiple tokens that a larger target model verifies simultaneously. However, applying this technique to vision-language models (VLMs) presents two fundamental challenges: small language models that could serve as efficient drafters lack the architectural components to process visual inputs, and their token predictions fail to match those of VLM target models that consider visual context. We introduce Multimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative Decoding of Vision-Language Models (MASSV), which transforms existing small language models into effective multimodal drafters through a two-phase approach. MASSV first connects the target VLM's vision encoder to the draft model via a lightweight trainable projector, then applies self-distilled visual instruction tuning using responses generated by the target VLM to align token predictions. Comprehensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma3 model families demonstrate that MASSV increases accepted length by up to 30% and delivers end-to-end inference speedups of up to 1.46x on visually-grounded tasks. MASSV provides a scalable, architecture-compatible method for accelerating both current and future VLMs.",

    "summary": "Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are highly favored by designers due to their resolution independence and well-organized layer structure. Although existing text-to-vector (T2V) generation methods can create SVGs from text prompts, they often overlook an important need in practical applications: style customization, which is vital for producing a collection of vector graphics with consistent visual appearance and coherent aesthetics. Extending existing T2V methods for style customization poses certain challenges. Optimization-based T2V models can utilize the priors of text-to-image (T2I) models for customization, but struggle with maintaining structural regularity. On the other hand, feed-forward T2V models can ensure structural regularity, yet they encounter difficulties in disentangling content and style due to limited SVG training data.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage style customization pipeline for SVG generation, making use of the advantages of both feed-forward T2V models and T2I image priors. In the first stage, we train a T2V diffusion model with a path-level representation to ensure the structural regularity of SVGs while preserving diverse expressive capabilities. In the second stage, we customize the T2V diffusion model to different styles by distilling customized T2I models. By integrating these techniques, our pipeline can generate high-quality and diverse SVGs in custom styles based on text prompts in an efficient feed-forward manner. The effectiveness of our method has been validated through extensive experiments. The project page is this https URL.",

    "summary": "Event camera, as an asynchronous vision sensor capturing scene dynamics, presents new opportunities for highly efficient 3D human pose tracking. Existing approaches typically adopt modern-day Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), such as CNNs or Transformer, where sparse events are converted into dense images or paired with additional gray-scale images as input. Such practices, however, ignore the inherent sparsity of events, resulting in redundant computations, increased energy consumption, and potentially degraded performance. Motivated by these observations, we introduce the first sparse Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) framework for 3D human pose tracking based solely on events. Our approach eliminates the need to convert sparse data to dense formats or incorporate additional images, thereby fully exploiting the innate sparsity of input events. Central to our framework is a novel Spiking Spatiotemporal Transformer, which enables bi-directional spatiotemporal fusion of spike pose features and provides a guaranteed similarity measurement between binary spike features in spiking attention. Moreover, we have constructed a large-scale synthetic dataset, SynEventHPD, that features a broad and diverse set of 3D human motions, as well as much longer hours of event streams. Empirical experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) ANN-based methods, requiring only 19.1% FLOPs and 3.6% energy cost. Furthermore, our approach outperforms existing SNN-based benchmarks in this task, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed SNN framework.

For student action recognition, we use human skeletons to model student postures and upper body movements. To learn the dynamics of student upper body, a 3D-CNN model is used. The trained 3D-CNN model is used to recognize actions within every 2minute video segment then these actions are used to build a histogram of actions which encodes the student actions and their frequencies. This histogram is utilized as an input to SVM classifier to classify whether the student is engaged or disengaged. To evaluate the proposed framework, we build a dataset consisting of 1414 2-minute video segments annotated with 13 actions and 112 video segments annotated with two engagement levels. Experimental results indicate that student actions can be recognized with top 1 accuracy 83.63% and the proposed framework can capture the average engagement of the class.",

    "summary": "Although remarkable progress has been made in image style transfer, style is just one of the components of artistic paintings. Directly transferring extracted style features to natural images often results in outputs with obvious synthetic traces. This is because key painting attributes including layout, perspective, shape, and semantics often cannot be conveyed and expressed through style transfer. Large-scale pretrained text-to-image generation models have demonstrated their capability to synthesize a vast amount of high-quality images. However, even with extensive textual descriptions, it is challenging to fully express the unique visual properties and details of paintings. Moreover, generic models often disrupt the overall artistic effect when modifying specific areas, making it more complicated to achieve a unified aesthetic in artworks. Our main novel idea is to integrate multimodal semantic information as a synthesis guide into artworks, rather than transferring style to the real world. We also aim to reduce the disruption to the harmony of artworks while simplifying the guidance conditions. Specifically, we propose an innovative multi-task unified framework called CreativeSynth, based on the diffusion model with the ability to coordinate multimodal inputs. CreativeSynth combines multimodal features with customized attention mechanisms to seamlessly integrate real-world semantic content into the art domain through Cross-Art-Attention for aesthetic maintenance and semantic fusion. We demonstrate the results of our method across a wide range of different art categories, proving that CreativeSynth bridges the gap between generative models and artistic expression.

    "summary": "3D multiple object tracking (MOT) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving perception. Recent end-to-end query-based trackers simultaneously detect and track objects, which have shown promising potential for the 3D MOT task. However, existing methods are still in the early stages of development and lack systematic improvements, failing to track objects in certain complex scenarios, like occlusions and the small size of target object's situations. In this paper, we first summarize the current end-to-end 3D MOT framework by decomposing it into three constituent parts: query initialization, query propagation, and query matching. Then we propose corresponding improvements, which lead to a strong yet simple tracker: S2-Track. Specifically, for query initialization, we present 2D-Prompted Query Initialization, which leverages predicted 2D object and depth information to prompt an initial estimate of the object's 3D location. For query propagation, we introduce an Uncertainty-aware Probabilistic Decoder to capture the uncertainty of complex environment in object prediction with probabilistic attention. For query matching, we propose a Hierarchical Query Denoising strategy to enhance training robustness and convergence. As a result, our S2-Track achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmark, i.e., 66.3% AMOTA on test split, surpassing the previous best end-to-end solution by a significant margin of 8.9% AMOTA.

    "summary": "With the exponential growth of video content, the need for automated video highlight detection to extract key moments or highlights from lengthy videos has become increasingly pressing. This technology has the potential to enhance user experiences by allowing quick access to relevant content across diverse domains. Existing methods typically rely either on expensive manually labeled frame-level annotations, or on a large external dataset of videos for weak supervision through category information. To overcome this, we focus on unsupervised video highlight detection, eliminating the need for manual annotations. We propose a novel unsupervised approach which capitalizes on the premise that significant moments tend to recur across multiple videos of the similar category in both audio and visual modalities. Surprisingly, audio remains under-explored, especially in unsupervised algorithms, despite its potential to detect key moments. Through a clustering technique, we identify pseudo-categories of videos and compute audio pseudo-highlight scores for each video by measuring the similarities of audio features among audio clips of all the videos within each pseudo-category. Similarly, we also compute visual pseudo-highlight scores for each video using visual features. Then, we combine audio and visual pseudo-highlights to create the audio-visual pseudo ground-truth highlight of each video for training an audio-visual highlight detection network. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on three benchmarks showcase the superior performance of our method over prior work.",

This paper first introduces a novel training-free algorithm in fine-grained generation, Aggregation of Multiple Diffusion Models (AMDM), which integrates features from multiple diffusion models into a specified model to activate specific features and enable fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that AMDM significantly improves fine-grained control without training, validating its effectiveness. Additionally, it reveals that diffusion models initially focus on features such as position, attributes, and style, with later stages improving generation quality and consistency. AMDM offers a new perspective for tackling the challenges of fine-grained conditional control generation in diffusion models: We can fully utilize existing or develop new conditional diffusion models that control specific aspects, and then aggregate them using AMDM algorithm.

    "summary": "Human hand and head movements are the most pervasive input modalities in extended reality (XR) and are significant for a wide range of applications. However, prior works on hand and head modelling in XR only explored a single modality or focused on specific applications. We present HaHeAE - a novel self-supervised method for learning generalisable joint representations of hand and head movements in XR. At the core of our method is an autoencoder (AE) that uses a graph convolutional network-based semantic encoder and a diffusion-based stochastic encoder to learn the joint semantic and stochastic representations of hand-head movements. It also features a diffusion-based decoder to reconstruct the original signals. Through extensive evaluations on three public XR datasets, we show that our method 1) significantly outperforms commonly used self-supervised methods by up to 74.0% in terms of reconstruction quality and is generalisable across users, activities, and XR environments, 2) enables new applications, including interpretable hand-head cluster identification and variable hand-head movement generation, and 3) can serve as an effective feature extractor for downstream tasks. Together, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and underline the potential of self-supervised methods for jointly modelling hand-head behaviours in extended reality.",

    "summary": "Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has achieved significant success in real-time, high-quality 3D scene rendering. However, it faces several challenges, including Gaussian redundancy, limited ability to capture view-dependent effects, and difficulties in handling complex lighting and specular reflections. Additionally, methods that use spherical harmonics for color representation often struggle to effectively capture anisotropic components, especially when modeling view-dependent colors under complex lighting conditions, leading to insufficient contrast and unnatural color saturation. To address these limitations, we introduce PEP-GS, a perceptually-enhanced framework that dynamically predicts Gaussian attributes, including opacity, color, and covariance. We replace traditional spherical harmonics with a Hierarchical Granular-Structural Attention mechanism, which enables more accurate modeling of complex view-dependent color effects. By employing a stable and interpretable framework for opacity and covariance estimation, PEP-GS avoids the removal of essential Gaussians prematurely, ensuring a more accurate scene representation. Furthermore, perceptual optimization is applied to the final rendered images, enhancing perceptual consistency across different views and ensuring high-quality renderings with improved texture fidelity and fine-scale detail preservation. Experimental results demonstrate that PEP-GS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving view-dependent effects and fine-scale details.",

    "summary": "OpenStreetMap (OSM), a rich and versatile source of volunteered geographic information (VGI), facilitates human self-localization and scene understanding by integrating nearby visual observations with vectorized map data. However, the disparity in modalities and perspectives poses a major challenge for effectively matching camera imagery with compact map representations, thereby limiting the full potential of VGI data in real-world localization applications.\nInspired by the fact that the human brain relies on the fusion of geometric and semantic understanding for spatial localization tasks, we propose the OSMLoc in this paper. OSMLoc is a brain-inspired visual localization approach based on first-person-view images against the OSM maps. It integrates semantic and geometric guidance to significantly improve accuracy, robustness, and generalization capability. First, we equip the OSMLoc with the visual foundational model to extract powerful image features. Second, a geometry-guided depth distribution adapter is proposed to bridge the monocular depth estimation and camera-to-BEV transform. Thirdly, the semantic embeddings from the OSM data are utilized as auxiliary guidance for image-to-OSM feature matching. To validate the proposed OSMLoc, we collect a worldwide cross-area and cross-condition (CC) benchmark for extensive evaluation. Experiments on the MGL dataset, CC validation benchmark, and KITTI dataset have demonstrated the superiority of our method.

    "summary": "In this paper, we introduce DINO-X, which is a unified object-centric vision model developed by IDEA Research with the best open-world object detection performance to date. DINO-X employs the same Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture as Grounding DINO 1.5 to pursue an object-level representation for open-world object understanding. To make long-tailed object detection easy, DINO-X extends its input options to support text prompt, visual prompt, and customized prompt. With such flexible prompt options, we develop a universal object prompt to support prompt-free open-world detection, making it possible to detect anything in an image without requiring users to provide any prompt. To enhance the model's core grounding capability, we have constructed a large-scale dataset with over 100 million high-quality grounding samples, referred to as Grounding-100M, for advancing the model's open-vocabulary detection performance. Pre-training on such a large-scale grounding dataset leads to a foundational object-level representation, which enables DINO-X to integrate multiple perception heads to simultaneously support multiple object perception and understanding tasks, including detection, segmentation, pose estimation, object captioning, object-based QA, etc. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of DINO-X. Specifically, the DINO-X Pro model achieves 56.0 AP, 59.8 AP, and 52.4 AP on the COCO, LVIS-minival, and LVIS-val zero-shot object detection benchmarks, respectively. Notably, it scores 63.3 AP and 56.5 AP on the rare classes of LVIS-minival and LVIS-val benchmarks, improving the previous SOTA performance by 5.8 AP and 5.0 AP. Such a result underscores its significantly improved capacity for recognizing long-tailed objects.",

    "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted significant attention for its high-quality novel view rendering, inspiring research to address real-world challenges. While conventional methods depend on sharp images for accurate scene reconstruction, real-world scenarios are often affected by defocus blur due to finite depth of field, making it essential to account for realistic 3D scene representation. In this study, we propose CoCoGaussian, a Circle of Confusion-aware Gaussian Splatting that enables precise 3D scene representation using only defocused images. CoCoGaussian addresses the challenge of defocus blur by modeling the Circle of Confusion (CoC) through a physically grounded approach based on the principles of photographic defocus. Exploiting 3D Gaussians, we compute the CoC diameter from depth and learnable aperture information, generating multiple Gaussians to precisely capture the CoC shape. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable scaling factor to enhance robustness and provide more flexibility in handling unreliable depth in scenes with reflective or refractive surfaces. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CoCoGaussian achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.",

    "summary": "Seagrass meadows play a crucial role in marine ecosystems, providing benefits such as carbon sequestration, water quality improvement, and habitat provision. Monitoring the distribution and abundance of seagrass is essential for environmental impact assessments and conservation efforts. However, the current manual methods of analyzing underwater video data to assess seagrass coverage are time-consuming and subjective. This work explores the use of deep learning models to automate the process of seagrass detection and coverage estimation from underwater video data. We create a new dataset of over 8,300 annotated underwater images, and subsequently evaluate several deep learning architectures, including ResNet, InceptionNetV3, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer for the task of binary classification on the presence and absence of seagrass by transfer learning. The results demonstrate that deep learning models, particularly Vision Transformers, can achieve high performance in predicting eelgrass presence, with AUROC scores exceeding 0.95 on the final test dataset. The application of underwater image enhancement further improved the models' prediction capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach for estimating seagrass coverage from video data, showing promising preliminary results that align with expert manual labels, and indicating potential for consistent and scalable monitoring. The proposed methodology allows for the efficient processing of large volumes of video data, enabling the acquisition of much more detailed information on seagrass distributions in comparison to current manual methods. This information is crucial for environmental impact assessments and monitoring programs, as seagrasses are important indicators of coastal ecosystem health. This project demonstrates the value that deep learning can bring to the field of marine ecology and environmental monitoring.",

    "summary": "Environmental crime is the third largest criminal activity worldwide, with significant revenues coming from illegal management of solid waste. Thanks to the increasing availability and the decreasing cost of Very High Resolution Remote Sensing (VHR RS) images, the fight against environmental crime can nowadays rely on modern image-analysis tools to support photo-interpretation for scanning vast territories in search of illegal waste disposal sites. This paper illustrates a semi-automatic waste detection pipeline, developed in collaboration with a regional environmental protection agency, for detecting candidate illegal dumping sites in VHR RS images. To optimize the effectiveness of the waste detector, extensive experiments evaluate such design choices as the network architecture, the ground resolution and geographic span of the input images, as well as the pretraining procedures. The best model attains remarkable performance, achieving 92.02% F1-Score and 94.56% Accuracy. A generalization study assesses the performance variation when the detector processes images from a territory substantially different from the one used during training, incurring only a moderate performance loss, i.e., 6.5% decrease in the F1-Score. Finally, an exercise in which photo interpreters compare the territory scanning effort with and without the support of the waste detector assesses the concrete benefit of using a computer-aided image analysis tool in a professional environment protection agency. Results show that a reduction up to 30% of the time spent for waste site detection can be attained.",

    "summary": "Endoscopic video-based tasks, such as visual navigation and surgical phase recognition, play a crucial role in minimally invasive surgeries by providing real-time assistance. While recent video foundation models have shown promise, their applications are hindered by (1) computational inefficiencies and (2) suboptimal performance caused by limited data for pre-training in endoscopy. To address these issues, we present EndoMamba, a foundation model designed for real-time inference while learning generalized spatiotemporal representations. First, to mitigate computational inefficiencies, we propose the EndoMamba backbone, optimized for real-time inference. Inspired by recent advancements in state space models, EndoMamba integrates Bidirectional Mamba blocks for spatial modeling within individual frames and vanilla Mamba blocks for past-to-present reasoning across the temporal domain. This design enables both strong spatiotemporal modeling and efficient inference in online video streams. Second, we propose a self-supervised hierarchical pre-training diagram to enhance EndoMamba's representation learning using endoscopic videos and incorporating general video domain knowledge. Specifically, our approach combines masked reconstruction with auxiliary supervision, leveraging low-level reconstruction to capture spatial-temporal structures and high-level alignment to transfer broader knowledge from a pretrained general-video domain foundation model. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks--classification, segmentation, surgical phase recognition, and localization--demonstrate that EndoMamba outperforms existing foundation models and task-specific methods while maintaining real-time inference speed.

    "summary": "Compared to width-wise pruning, depth-wise pruning can significantly accelerate inference in resource-constrained scenarios. However, treating the entire Transformer layer as the minimum pruning unit may degrade model performance by indiscriminately discarding the entire information of the layer. This paper reveals the ``Patch-like'' feature relationship between layers in large language models by analyzing the correlation of the outputs of different layers in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Building on this observation, we propose a sliding layer merging method that dynamically selects and fuses consecutive layers from top to bottom according to a pre-defined similarity threshold, thereby simplifying the model structure while maintaining its performance. Extensive experiments on LLMs with various architectures and different parameter scales show that our method outperforms existing pruning techniques in both zero-shot inference performance and retraining recovery quality after pruning. In particular, in the experiment with 35% pruning on the Vicuna-7B model, our method achieved a 1.654% improvement in average performance on zero-shot tasks compared to the existing method. Moreover, we further reveal the potential of combining depth pruning with width pruning to enhance the pruning effect. Our codes are available at this https URL.",

    "summary": "For 3D face modeling, the recently developed 3D-aware neural rendering methods are able to render photorealistic face images with arbitrary viewing directions. The training of the parametric controllable 3D-aware face models, however, still relies on a large-scale dataset that is lab-collected. To address this issue, this paper introduces \"StyleMorpheus\", the first style-based neural 3D Morphable Face Model (3DMM) that is trained on in-the-wild images. It inherits 3DMM's disentangled controllability (over face identity, expression, and appearance) but without the need for accurately reconstructed explicit 3D shapes. StyleMorpheus employs an auto-encoder structure. The encoder aims at learning a representative disentangled parametric code space and the decoder improves the disentanglement using shape and appearance-related style codes in the different sub-modules of the network. Furthermore, we fine-tune the decoder through style-based generative adversarial learning to achieve photorealistic 3D rendering quality. The proposed style-based design enables StyleMorpheus to achieve state-of-the-art 3D-aware face reconstruction results, while also allowing disentangled control of the reconstructed face. Our model achieves real-time rendering speed, allowing its use in virtual reality applications. We also demonstrate the capability of the proposed style-based design in face editing applications such as style mixing and color editing. Project homepage: this https URL.",

To address these issues, we first propose the T-GRPO algorithm, which encourages models to utilize temporal information in videos for reasoning. Additionally, instead of relying solely on video data, we incorporate high-quality image-reasoning data into the training process. We have constructed two datasets: Video-R1-CoT-165k for SFT cold start and Video-R1-260k for RL training, both comprising image and video data. Experimental results demonstrate that Video-R1 achieves significant improvements on video reasoning benchmarks such as VideoMMMU and VSI-Bench, as well as on general video benchmarks including MVBench and TempCompass, etc. Notably, Video-R1-7B attains a 37.1% accuracy on video spatial reasoning benchmark VSI-bench, surpassing the commercial proprietary model GPT-4o.

    "summary": "Learned image compression methods have attracted great research interest and exhibited superior rate-distortion performance to the best classical image compression standards of the present. The entropy model plays a key role in learned image compression, which estimates the probability distribution of the latent representation for further entropy coding. Most existing methods employed hyper-prior and auto-regressive architectures to form their entropy models. However, they only aimed to explore the internal dependencies of latent representation while neglecting the importance of extracting prior from training data. In this work, we propose a novel entropy model named Dictionary-based Cross Attention Entropy model, which introduces a learnable dictionary to summarize the typical structures occurring in the training dataset to enhance the entropy model. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed model strikes a better balance between performance and latency, achieving state-of-the-art results on various benchmark datasets.",

    "summary": "The capacity of Vision transformers (ViTs) to handle variable-sized inputs is often constrained by computational complexity and batch processing limitations. Consequently, ViTs are typically trained on small, fixed-size images obtained through downscaling or cropping. While reducing computational burden, these methods result in significant information loss, negatively affecting tasks like image aesthetic assessment. We introduce Charm, a novel tokenization approach that preserves Composition, High-resolution, Aspect Ratio, and Multi-scale information simultaneously. Charm prioritizes high-resolution details in specific regions while downscaling others, enabling shorter fixed-size input sequences for ViTs while incorporating essential information. Charm is designed to be compatible with pre-trained ViTs and their learned positional embeddings. By providing multiscale input and introducing variety to input tokens, Charm improves ViT performance and generalizability for image aesthetic assessment. We avoid cropping or changing the aspect ratio to further preserve information. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements on various image aesthetic and quality assessment datasets (up to 8.1 %) using a lightweight ViT backbone.

    "summary": "Tactile graphics are essential for providing access to visual information for the 43 million people globally living with vision loss. Traditional methods for creating these graphics are labor-intensive and cannot meet growing demand. We introduce TactileNet, the first comprehensive dataset and AI-driven framework for generating embossing-ready 2D tactile templates using text-to-image Stable Diffusion (SD) models. By integrating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and DreamBooth, our method fine-tunes SD models to produce high-fidelity, guideline-compliant graphics while reducing computational costs. Quantitative evaluations with tactile experts show 92.86% adherence to accessibility standards. Structural fidelity analysis revealed near-human design similarity, with an SSIM of 0.538 between generated graphics and expert-designed tactile images. Notably, our method preserves object silhouettes better than human designs (SSIM = 0.259 vs. 0.215 for binary masks), addressing a key limitation of manual tactile abstraction. The framework scales to 32,000 images (7,050 high-quality) across 66 classes, with prompt editing enabling customizable outputs (e.g., adding or removing details). By automating the 2D template generation step-compatible with standard embossing workflows-TactileNet accelerates production while preserving design flexibility. This work demonstrates how AI can augment (not replace) human expertise to bridge the accessibility gap in education and beyond. Code, data, and models will be publicly released to foster further research.",

    "summary": "Recent mainstream unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS) motion-appearance approaches use either the bi-encoder structure to separately encode motion and appearance features, or the uni-encoder structure for joint encoding. However, these methods fail to properly balance the motion-appearance relationship. Consequently, even with complex fusion modules for motion-appearance integration, the extracted suboptimal features degrade the models' overall performance. Moreover, the quality of optical flow varies across scenarios, making it insufficient to rely solely on optical flow to achieve high-quality segmentation results. To address these challenges, we propose the Saliency-Motion guided Trunk-Collateral Network (SMTC-Net), which better balances the motion-appearance relationship and incorporates model's intrinsic saliency information to enhance segmentation performance. Specifically, considering that optical flow maps are derived from RGB images, they share both commonalities and differences. Accordingly, we propose a novel Trunk-Collateral structure for motion-appearance UVOS. The shared trunk backbone captures the motion-appearance commonality, while the collateral branch learns the uniqueness of motion features. Furthermore, an Intrinsic Saliency guided Refinement Module (ISRM) is devised to efficiently leverage the model's intrinsic saliency information to refine high-level features, and provide pixel-level guidance for motion-appearance fusion, thereby enhancing performance without additional input. Experimental results show that SMTC-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance on three UVOS datasets ( 89.2% J&F on DAVIS-16, 76% J on YouTube-Objects, 86.4% J on FBMS ) and four standard video salient object detection (VSOD) benchmarks with the notable increase, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority over previous methods.",

Experiments across six domains, including black hole simulations, butterfly taxonomy, and medical imaging, demonstrate accurate transitions with limited training data, highlighting both established discriminative features and novel subtle distinctions that measurably improved category differentiation.

Our best-performing transformer-based fine-tuned model reaches 83% f-score, outperforming gpt4 by 23%. As a use case, we demonstrate how this model can be used to uncover trends during wildfires.

We introduce an interactive visualization tool for inspecting segmented trees and their estimated DBH. On 61 acquisitions of 43 trees under a variety of conditions, our method attains median absolute relative errors of 5-9% with respect to \"ground-truth\" manual measurements. This is only 2-4% higher than LiDAR-based estimates, while employing a single 360 camera that costs orders of magnitude less, requires minimal setup, and is widely available.",

    "summary": "Rice is an essential staple food worldwide that is important in promoting international trade, economic growth, and nutrition. Asian countries such as China, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia are notable for their significant contribution to the cultivation and utilization of rice. These nations are also known for cultivating different rice grains, including short and long grains. These sizes are further classified as basmati, jasmine, kainat saila, ipsala, arborio, etc., catering to diverse culinary preferences and cultural traditions. For both local and international trade, inspecting and maintaining the quality of rice grains to satisfy customers and preserve a country's reputation is necessary. Manual quality check and classification is quite a laborious and time-consuming process. It is also highly prone to mistakes. Therefore, an automatic solution must be proposed for the effective and efficient classification of different varieties of rice grains. This research paper presents an automatic framework based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying different varieties of rice grains. We evaluated the proposed model based on performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score. The CNN model underwent rigorous training and validation, achieving a remarkable accuracy rate and a perfect area under each class's Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The confusion matrix analysis confirmed the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between the different rice varieties, indicating minimal misclassifications. Additionally, the integration of explainability techniques such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) provided valuable insights into the model's decision-making process, revealing how specific features of the rice grains influenced classification outcomes.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we explore a novel approach to 3D anomaly detection (AD) that goes beyond merely identifying anomalies based on structural characteristics. Our primary perspective is that most anomalies arise from unpredictable defective forces originating from both internal and external sources. To address these anomalies, we seek out opposing forces that can help correct them. Therefore, we introduce the Mechanics Complementary Model-based Framework for the 3D-AD task (MC4AD), which generates internal and external corrective forces for each point. We first propose a Diverse Anomaly-Generation (DA-Gen) module designed to simulate various types of anomalies. Next, we present the Corrective Force Prediction Network (CFP-Net), which uses complementary representations for point-level analysis to simulate the different contributions from internal and external corrective forces. To ensure the corrective forces are constrained effectively, we have developed a combined loss function that includes a new symmetric loss and an overall loss. Notably, we implement a Hierarchical Quality Control (HQC) strategy based on a three-way decision process and contribute a dataset titled Anomaly-IntraVariance, which incorporates intraclass variance to evaluate our model. As a result, the proposed MC4AD has been proven effective through theory and experimentation. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach yields nine state-of-the-art performances, achieving optimal results with minimal parameters and the fastest inference speed across five existing datasets, in addition to the proposed Anomaly-IntraVariance dataset.

    "summary": "Text-to-image synthesis has progressed to the point where models can generate visually compelling images from natural language prompts. Yet, existing methods often fail to reconcile high-level semantic fidelity with explicit spatial control, particularly in scenes involving multiple objects, nuanced relations, or complex layouts. To bridge this gap, we propose a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Alignment (HCMA) framework for grounded text-to-image generation. HCMA integrates two alignment modules into each diffusion sampling step: a global module that continuously aligns latent representations with textual descriptions to ensure scene-level coherence, and a local module that employs bounding-box layouts to anchor objects at specified locations, enabling fine-grained spatial control. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO 2014 validation set show that HCMA surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 0.69 improvement in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and a 0.0295 gain in CLIP Score. These results demonstrate HCMA's effectiveness in faithfully capturing intricate textual semantics while adhering to user-defined spatial constraints, offering a robust solution for semantically grounded image generation.

Our approach leverages data augmentation techniques, including graphic transformations, Contrastive Unpaired Translation (CUT), and CycleGAN, to address the scarcity of medical imaging data. We evaluate the classification performance of two deep learning models, GoogLeNet and Vision Transformer (ViT), across a dataset significantly expanded through these augmentation methods. The results demonstrate GoogLeNet combined with CUT as the most effective configuration for grading inhalation injuries through bronchoscopy images and achieves a classification accuracy of 97.8%. The histograms and frequency analysis evaluations reveal variations caused by the augmentation CUT with distribution changes in the histogram and texture details of the frequency spectrum. PCA visualizations underscore the CUT substantially enhances class separability in the feature space. Moreover, Grad-CAM analyses provide insight into the decision-making process; mean intensity for CUT heatmaps is 119.6, which significantly exceeds 98.8 of the original datasets.

While existing methods primarily focus on optimizing visual representations, incorporating additional modalities and refining object-level information can significantly improve the quality of distilled datasets. In this work, we introduce two key enhancements to dataset distillation: caption-guided supervision and object-centric masking. To integrate textual information, we propose two strategies for leveraging caption features: the feature concatenation, where caption embeddings are fused with visual features at the classification stage, and caption matching, which introduces a caption-based alignment loss during training to ensure semantic coherence between real and synthetic data. Additionally, we apply segmentation masks to isolate target objects and remove background distractions, introducing two loss functions designed for object-centric learning: masked feature alignment loss and masked gradient matching loss. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that integrating caption-based guidance and object-centric masking enhances dataset distillation, leading to synthetic datasets that achieve superior performance on downstream tasks.",

    "summary": "In recent times, we have seen a rapid development of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). They have shown impressive results on academic benchmarks, primarily in widely spoken languages but lack performance on low-resource languages and varied cultural contexts. To address these limitations, we introduce Maya, an open-source Multilingual VLM. Our contributions are: 1) a multilingual image-text pretraining dataset in eight languages, based on the LLaVA pretraining dataset; and 2) a multilingual image-text model supporting these languages, enhancing cultural and linguistic comprehension in vision-language tasks.

    "summary": "The growing complexity and scale of visual model pre-training have made developing and deploying multi-task computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems increasingly challenging and resource-intensive. Furthermore, the medical imaging community lacks an open-source CAD platform to enable the rapid creation of efficient and extendable diagnostic models. To address these issues, we propose UniCAD, a unified architecture that leverages the robust capabilities of pre-trained vision foundation models to seamlessly handle both 2D and 3D medical images while requiring only minimal task-specific parameters. UniCAD introduces two key innovations: (1) Efficiency: A low-rank adaptation strategy is employed to adapt a pre-trained visual model to the medical image domain, achieving performance on par with fully fine-tuned counterparts while introducing only 0.17% trainable parameters. (2) Plug-and-Play: A modular architecture that combines a frozen foundation model with multiple plug-and-play experts, enabling diverse tasks and seamless functionality expansion. Building on this unified CAD architecture, we establish an open-source platform where researchers can share and access lightweight CAD experts, fostering a more equitable and efficient research ecosystem. Comprehensive experiments across 12 diverse medical datasets demonstrate that UniCAD consistently outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and deployment efficiency.

Learning from visual observations further exacerbates this difficulty. In this work, we explore highly data-driven approaches to visual whole-body humanoid control based on reinforcement learning, without any simplifying assumptions, reward design, or skill primitives. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical world model in which a high-level agent generates commands based on visual observations for a low-level agent to execute, both of which are trained with rewards.

    "summary": "There is a demand for medical image synthesis or translation to generate synthetic images of missing modalities from available data. This need stems from challenges such as restricted access to high-cost imaging devices, government regulations, or failure to follow up with patients or study participants. In medical imaging, preserving high-level semantic features is often more critical than achieving pixel-level accuracy. Perceptual loss functions are widely employed to train medical image synthesis or translation models, as they quantify differences in high-level image features using a pre-trained feature extraction network. While 3D and 2.5D perceptual losses are used in 3D medical image synthesis, they face challenges, such as the lack of pre-trained 3D models or difficulties in balancing loss reduction across different planes. In this work, we focus on synthesizing 3D tau PET images from 3D T1-weighted MR images. We propose a cyclic 2.5D perceptual loss that sequentially computes the 2D average perceptual loss for each of the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes over epochs, with the cycle duration gradually decreasing. Additionally, we process tau PET images using by-manufacturer standardization to enhance the preservation of high-SUVR regions indicative of tau pathology and mitigate SUVR variability caused by inter-manufacturer differences. We combine the proposed loss with SSIM and MSE losses and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving both quantitative and qualitative performance across various generative models, including U-Net, UNETR, SwinUNETR, CycleGAN, and Pix2Pix.",

    "summary": "We introduce Latent Action Pretraining for general Action models (LAPA), an unsupervised method for pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models without ground-truth robot action labels. Existing Vision-Language-Action models require action labels typically collected by human teleoperators during pretraining, which significantly limits possible data sources and scale. In this work, we propose a method to learn from internet-scale videos that do not have robot action labels. We first train an action quantization model leveraging VQ-VAE-based objective to learn discrete latent actions between image frames, then pretrain a latent VLA model to predict these latent actions from observations and task descriptions, and finally finetune the VLA on small-scale robot manipulation data to map from latent to robot actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing techniques that train robot manipulation policies from large-scale videos. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model trained with robotic action labels on real-world manipulation tasks that require language conditioning, generalization to unseen objects, and semantic generalization to unseen instructions. Training only on human manipulation videos also shows positive transfer, opening up the potential for leveraging web-scale data for robotics foundation model.",

    "summary": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of global mortality, necessitating accessible and accurate diagnostic tools. While cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) provides gold-standard insights into cardiac structure and function, its clinical utility is limited by high cost and complexity. In contrast, electrocardiography (ECG) is inexpensive and widely available but lacks the granularity of CMR. We propose CardioNets, a deep learning framework that translates 12-lead ECG signals into CMR-level functional parameters and synthetic images, enabling scalable cardiac assessment. CardioNets integrates cross-modal contrastive learning and generative pretraining, aligning ECG with CMR-derived cardiac phenotypes and synthesizing high-resolution CMR images via a masked autoregressive model. Trained on 159,819 samples from five cohorts, including the UK Biobank (n=42,483) and MIMIC-IV-ECG (n=164,550), and externally validated on independent clinical datasets (n=3,767), CardioNets achieved strong performance across disease screening and phenotype estimation tasks. In the UK Biobank, it improved cardiac phenotype regression R2 by 24.8% and cardiomyopathy AUC by up to 39.3% over baseline models. In MIMIC, it increased AUC for pulmonary hypertension detection by 5.6%. Generated CMR images showed 36.6% higher SSIM and 8.7% higher PSNR than prior approaches. In a reader study, ECG-only CardioNets achieved 13.9% higher accuracy than human physicians using both ECG and real CMR. These results suggest that CardioNets offers a promising, low-cost alternative to CMR for large-scale CVD screening, particularly in resource-limited settings. Future efforts will focus on clinical deployment and regulatory validation of ECG-based synthetic imaging.",

    "summary": "Adversarial examples usually exhibit good cross-model transferability, enabling attacks on black-box models with limited information about their architectures and parameters, which are highly threatening in commercial black-box scenarios. Model ensembling is an effective strategy to improve the transferability of adversarial examples by attacking multiple surrogate models. However, since prior studies usually adopt few models in the ensemble, there remains an open question of whether scaling the number of models can further improve black-box attacks. Inspired by the scaling law of large foundation models, we investigate the scaling laws of black-box adversarial attacks in this work. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations, we conclude with clear scaling laws that using more surrogate models enhances adversarial transferability. Comprehensive experiments verify the claims on standard image classifiers, diverse defended models and multimodal large language models using various adversarial attack methods. Specifically, by scaling law, we achieve 90%+ transfer attack success rate on even proprietary models like GPT-4o. Further visualization indicates that there is also a scaling law on the interpretability and semantics of adversarial perturbations.",

Results: DISCUS outperformed competing methods, demonstrating superior reconstruction quality in terms of NMSE and SSIM (Studies I--III) and expert reader scoring (Study IV).

    "summary": "Reducing MRI scan times can improve patient care and lower healthcare costs. Many acceleration methods are designed to reconstruct diagnostic-quality images from sparse k-space data, via an ill-posed or ill-conditioned linear inverse problem (LIP). To address the resulting ambiguities, it is crucial to incorporate prior knowledge into the optimization problem, e.g., in the form of regularization. Another form of prior knowledge less commonly used in medical imaging is the readily available auxiliary data (a.k.a. side information) obtained from sources other than the current acquisition. In this paper, we present the Trust- Guided Variational Network (TGVN), an end-to-end deep learning framework that effectively and reliably integrates side information into LIPs. We demonstrate its effectiveness in multi-coil, multi-contrast MRI reconstruction, where incomplete or low-SNR measurements from one contrast are used as side information to reconstruct high-quality images of another contrast from heavily under-sampled data. TGVN is robust across different contrasts, anatomies, and field strengths. Compared to baselines utilizing side information, TGVN achieves superior image quality while preserving subtle pathological features even at challenging acceleration levels, drastically speeding up acquisition while minimizing hallucinations.

While recent advances have enhanced human body recovery, accurate reconstruction of garment geometry -- especially for loose-fitting clothing -- remains an open challenge. We present a novel method for high-fidelity 3D garment reconstruction from single images that bridges 2D and 3D representations. Our approach combines Implicit Sewing Patterns (ISP) with a generative diffusion model to learn rich garment shape priors in a 2D UV space. A key innovation is our mapping model that establishes correspondences between 2D image pixels, UV pattern coordinates, and 3D geometry, enabling joint optimization of both 3D garment meshes and the corresponding 2D patterns by aligning learned priors with image observations. Despite training exclusively on synthetically simulated cloth data, our method generalizes effectively to real-world images, outperforming existing approaches on both tight- and loose-fitting garments. The reconstructed garments maintain physical plausibility while capturing fine geometric details, enabling downstream applications including garment retargeting and texture manipulation.",

CoGenAV is trained by optimizing a dual objective derived from natural audio-visual synchrony, contrastive feature alignment and generative text prediction, using only 223 hours of labeled data from the LRS2 dataset. This contrastive-generative synchronization strategy effectively captures fundamental cross-modal correlations. We showcase the effectiveness and versatility of the learned CoGenAV representations on multiple benchmarks. When utilized for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) on LRS2, these representations contribute to achieving a state-of-the-art Word Error Rate (WER) of 1.27. They also enable strong performance in Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) with a WER of 20.5 on LRS2, and significantly improve performance in noisy environments by over 70%. Furthermore, CoGenAV representations benefit speech reconstruction tasks, boosting performance in Speech Enhancement and Separation, and achieve competitive results in audio-visual synchronization tasks like Active Speaker Detection (ASD).

Quantum CNNs (QCNNs) leverage quantum mechanical properties and hold potential to outperform classical approaches.

In our research, we address this challenge by introducing an encoding scheme that significantly reduces the input dimensionality. We demonstrate that a primitive QCNN architecture with 49 qubits is sufficient to directly process $28\\times 28$ pixel MNIST images, eliminating the need for classical dimensionality reduction pre-processing. Additionally, we propose an automated framework based on expressibility, entanglement, and complexity characteristics to identify the building blocks of QCNNs, parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Our approach demonstrates advantages in accuracy and convergence speed with a similar parameter count compared to both hybrid QCNNs and classical CNNs. We validated our experiments on IBM's Heron r2 quantum processor, achieving $96.08\\%$ classification accuracy, surpassing the $71.74\\%$ benchmark of traditional approaches under identical training conditions.

Furthermore, to determine the optimal interaction paradigm under near-far attention-switching for refining segmentation masks in an immersive, human-in-the-loop workflow, we compare VR controller pointing, head pointing, and eye tracking as input modes.

Our proposed approach first captures the image reflected on the eye's cornea when a smartphone screen-generated Placido disc sheds its light on an eye, then utilizes a two-stage diagnosis for identifying the KC cornea and pinpointing the location of the KC on the cornea. The first stage estimates the height and width of the Placido disc extracted from the captured image to identify whether it has KC. In this KC identification, k-means clustering is implemented to discern statistical characteristics, such as height and width values of extracted Placido discs, from non-KC (control) and KC-affected groups. The second stage involves the creation of a distance matrix, providing a precise localization of KC on the cornea, which is critical for efficient treatment planning. The analysis of these distance matrices, paired with a logistic regression model and robust statistical analysis, reveals a clear distinction between control and KC groups. The logistic regression model, which classifies small areas on the cornea as either control or KC-affected based on the corresponding inter-disc distances in the distance matrix, reported a classification accuracy of 96.94%, which indicates that we can effectively pinpoint the protrusion caused by KC. This comprehensive, smartphone-based method is expected to detect KC and streamline timely treatment.",

    "summary": "Mimicry is a fundamental learning mechanism in humans, enabling individuals to learn new tasks by observing and imitating experts. However, applying this ability to robots presents significant challenges due to the inherent differences between human and robot embodiments in both their visual appearance and physical capabilities. While previous methods bridge this gap using cross-embodiment datasets with shared scenes and tasks, collecting such aligned data between humans and robots at scale is not trivial. In this paper, we propose UniSkill, a novel framework that learns embodiment-agnostic skill representations from large-scale cross-embodiment video data without any labels, enabling skills extracted from human video prompts to effectively transfer to robot policies trained only on robot data. Our experiments in both simulation and real-world environments show that our cross-embodiment skills successfully guide robots in selecting appropriate actions, even with unseen video prompts.

    "summary": "Generative diffusion models have advanced image editing with high-quality results and intuitive interfaces such as prompts and semantic drawing. However, these interfaces lack precise control, and the associated methods typically specialize on a single editing task. We introduce a versatile, generative workflow that operates in an intrinsic-image latent space, enabling semantic, local manipulation with pixel precision for a range of editing operations. Building atop the RGB-X diffusion framework, we address key challenges of identity preservation and intrinsic-channel entanglement. By incorporating exact diffusion inversion and disentangled channel manipulation, we enable precise, efficient editing with automatic resolution of global illumination effects -- all without additional data collection or model fine-tuning. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks on complex images, including color and texture adjustments, object insertion and removal, global relighting, and their combinations.",

    "summary": "Recent forward prediction-based learned video compression (LVC) methods have achieved impressive results, even surpassing VVC reference software VTM under the Low Delay B (LDB) configuration. In contrast, learned bidirectional video compression (BVC) remains underexplored and still lags behind its forward-only counterparts. This performance gap is mainly due to the limited ability to extract diverse and accurate contexts: most existing BVCs primarily exploit temporal motion while neglecting non-local correlations across frames. Moreover, they lack the adaptability to dynamically suppress harmful contexts arising from fast motion or occlusion. To tackle these challenges, we propose BiECVC, a BVC framework that incorporates diversified local and non-local context modeling along with adaptive context gating. For local context enhancement, BiECVC reuses high-quality features from lower layers and aligns them using decoded motion vectors without introducing extra motion overhead. To model non-local dependencies efficiently, we adopt a linear attention mechanism that balances performance and complexity. To further mitigate the impact of inaccurate context prediction, we introduce Bidirectional Context Gating, inspired by data-dependent decay in recent autoregressive language models, to dynamically filter contextual information based on conditional coding results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiECVC achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing the bit-rate by 13.4% and 15.7% compared to VTM 13.2 under the Random Access (RA) configuration with intra periods of 32 and 64, respectively. To our knowledge, BiECVC is the first learned video codec to surpass VTM 13.2 RA across all standard test datasets. Code will be available at this https URL.",

    "summary": "Under the slogan of trustworthy AI, much of contemporary AI research is focused on designing AI systems and usage practices that inspire human trust and, thus, enhance adoption of AI systems. However, a person affected by an AI system may not be convinced by AI system design alone -- neither should they, if the AI system is embedded in a social context that gives good reason to believe that it is used in tension with a person's interest. In such cases, distrust in the system may be justified and necessary to build meaningful trust in the first place. We propose the term \"healthy distrust\" to describe such a justified, careful stance towards certain AI usage practices. We investigate prior notions of trust and distrust in computer science, sociology, history, psychology, and philosophy, outline a remaining gap that healthy distrust might fill and conceptualize healthy distrust as a crucial part for AI usage that respects human autonomy.",

The numerous applications of agricultural robots rely on the transmission of data via mobile network, with the amount of data depending on the services offered by the robots and the level of on-board technology. Nevertheless, infrastructure required to deploy these robots, as well as the related energy and environmental consequences, appear overlooked in the digital agriculture literature. In this study, we propose a method for assessing the additional energy consumption and carbon footprint induced by a large-scale deployment of agricultural robots. Our method also estimates the share of agricultural area that can be managed by the deployed robots with respect to network infrastructure constraints. We have applied this method to metropolitan France mobile network and agricultural parcels for five different robotic scenarios. Our results show that increasing the robot's bitrate needs leads to significant additional impacts, which increase at a pace that is poorly captured by classical linear extrapolation methods. When constraining the network to the existing sites, increased bitrate needs also comes with a rapidly decreasing manageable agricultural area.",

This paper explores a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach to evaluate and prioritize process models by incorporating both quantitative metrics (e.g., fitness, precision) and qualitative factors (e.g., cultural fit). An illustrative logistics example demonstrates how MCDM, specifically the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), facilitates trade-off analysis and promotes alignment with managerial objectives. Initial insights suggest that the MCDM approach enhances context-sensitive decision-making, as selected models address both operational metrics and broader managerial needs. While this study is an early-stage exploration, it provides an initial foundation for deeper exploration of MCDM-driven strategies to enhance the role of process mining in complex organizational settings.",

    "summary": "The legal compliance and safety of different Human-in-the-loop (HITL) setups for AI can vary greatly. This manuscript aims to identify new ways of choosing between such setups, and shows that there is an unavoidable trade-off between the attribution of legal responsibility and the technical explainability of AI. We begin by using the notion of oracle machines from computability theory to formalise different HITL setups, distinguishing between trivial human monitoring, single endpoint human action, and highly involved interaction between the human(s) and the AI. These correspond to total functions, many-one reductions, and Turing reductions respectively. A taxonomy categorising HITL failure modes is then presented, highlighting the limitations on what any HITL setup can actually achieve. Our approach then identifies oversights from UK and EU legal frameworks, which focus on certain HITL setups which may not always achieve the desired ethical, legal, and sociotechnical outcomes. We suggest areas where the law should recognise the effectiveness of different HITL setups and assign responsibility in these contexts, avoiding unnecessary and unproductive human \"scapegoating\". Overall, we show how HITL setups involve many technical design decisions, and can be prone to failures which are often out of the humans' control. This opens up a new analytic perspective on the challenges arising in the creation of HITL setups, helping inform AI developers and lawmakers on designing HITL to better achieve their desired outcomes.",

While XAI is traditionally framed around explaining individual predictions or overall system behavior, explanations also function as a form of argumentation, shaping how users evaluate system perceived usefulness, credibility, and foster appropriate trust. Rhetorical Design offers a useful framework to analyze the communicative role of explanations between AI systems and users, focusing on: (1) logical reasoning conveyed through different types of explanations, (2) credibility projected by the system and its developers, and (3) emotional resonance elicited in users. Together, these rhetorical appeals help us understand how explanations influence user perceptions and facilitate AI adoption. This paper synthesizes design strategies from prior XAI work that align with these three rhetorical appeals and highlights both opportunities and challenges of integrating rhetorical design into XAI design.",

Readiness determination is, at its core, a risk assessment process. It is aimed at evaluating the residual risk associated with the deployment of a new software release candidate. The paper proposes methodological criteria to ground the readiness review process for an ADS release. While informed by Waymo's experience in this domain, the criteria presented are agnostic of any specific ADS technological solution and/or architectural choice, to support broad implementation by others in the industry. The paper continues with a discussion on governance and decision-making toward approval of a new software release candidate for the ADS. The implementation of the presented criteria requires the existence of appropriate safety management practices in addition to many other cultural, procedural, and operational considerations.

    "summary": "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) lack direct interaction between learners and instructors, making it challenging for learners to understand new knowledge concepts. Recently, learners have increasingly used Large Language Models (LLMs) to support them in acquiring new knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to hallucinations which limits their reliability. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving relevant documents before generating a response. However, the application of RAG across different MOOCs is limited by unstructured learning material. Furthermore, current RAG systems do not actively guide learners toward their learning needs. To address these challenges, we propose a Graph RAG pipeline that leverages Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) and Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) to guide learners to understand knowledge concepts in the MOOC platform CourseMapper. Specifically, we implement (1) a PKG-based Question Generation method to recommend personalized questions for learners in context, and (2) an EduKG-based Question Answering method that leverages the relationships between knowledge concepts in the EduKG to answer learner selected questions. To evaluate both methods, we conducted a study with 3 expert instructors on 3 different MOOCs in the MOOC platform CourseMapper. The results of the evaluation show the potential of Graph RAG to empower learners to understand new knowledge concepts in a personalized learning experience.",

    "summary": "The research examines the challenges revolving around young people's social movements, activism regarding sustainability, as well as the accompanying social media aspect, and how social media impacts environmental action. This study focuses on the environmental craze on social media platforms and its impact on young activists aged 16-25. With the advancement of social media, new avenues have opened for participation in sustainability issues, especially for the marginalized, as information moved through transnational networks at lightning speed. Along with specific Formative Visual Storytelling methods, the young leaders of the movement deploy hashtags and other online tools to capture the attention of their peers and decision makers. Challenges persist with \"clicktivism\" fatigue from the internet, and site limitations. This article contributes to insights on emerging forms of civic activism by explaining how digital natives adapt technology to reframe green activism. The research suggests that effective digital environmental movements integrate online and offline action, make it simple for individuals to get involved, and promote tolerance to algorithmic modifications and climate care among participants.",

This is an encouraging development. The CI theory emphasizes sharing information in accordance with privacy norms and can bridge the social, legal, political, and technical aspects essential for evaluating privacy in LLMs. However, this is also a good point to reflect on use of CI for LLMs. This position paper argues that existing literature inadequately applies CI for LLMs without embracing the theory's fundamental tenets.\nInadequate applications of CI could lead to incorrect conclusions and flawed privacy-preserving designs. We clarify the four fundamental tenets of CI theory, systematize prior work on whether they deviate from these tenets, and highlight overlooked issues in experimental hygiene for LLMs (e.g., prompt sensitivity, positional bias).",

Through evaluation of 115 course deliverables, we assess LLM performance using ChatGPT under a \"minimal effort\" protocol that simulates realistic student usage patterns. The investigation employs a rigorous testing methodology across multiple assessment formats, from auto-graded multiple choice questions to complex Python programming tasks and long-form analytical writing. Our analysis provides quantitative insights into AI's strengths and limitations in handling mathematical formulations, coding challenges, and theoretical concepts in control systems engineering. The LLM achieved a B-grade performance (82.24\\%), approaching but not exceeding the class average (84.99\\%), with strongest results in structured assignments and greatest limitations in open-ended projects. The findings inform discussions about course design adaptation in response to AI advancement, moving beyond simple prohibition towards thoughtful integration of these tools in engineering education.

    "summary": "Implicit bias refers to automatic mental processes that shape perceptions, judgments, and behaviors. Previous research on \"implicit bias\" in LLMs focused primarily on outputs rather than the processes underlying the outputs. We present the Reasoning Model Implicit Association Test (RM-IAT) to study implicit bias-like processing in reasoning models, which are LLMs using step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks. Using RM-IAT, we find o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 require more tokens when processing association-incompatible information, mirroring human implicit bias patterns. Conversely, Claude 3.7 Sonnet displays reversed patterns for race and gender tests, requiring more tokens for association-compatible information. This reversal appears linked to differences in safety mechanism activation, increasing deliberation in sensitive contexts. These findings suggest AI systems can exhibit processing patterns analogous to both human implicit bias and bias correction mechanisms.",

    "summary": "Despite the precision and adaptiveness of generative AI (GAI)-powered feedback provided to students, existing practice and literature might ignore how usage patterns impact student learning. This study examines the heterogeneous effects of GAI-powered personalized feedback on high school students' physics achievement and autonomy through two randomized controlled trials, with a major focus on usage patterns. Each experiment lasted for five weeks, involving a total of 387 students. Experiment 1 (n = 121) assessed compulsory usage of the personalized recommendation system, revealing that low-achieving students significantly improved academic performance (d = 0.673, p < 0.05) when receiving AI-generated heuristic solution hints, whereas medium-achieving students' performance declined (d = -0.539, p < 0.05) with conventional answers provided by workbook. Notably, high-achieving students experienced a significant decline in self-regulated learning (d = -0.477, p < 0.05) without any significant gains in achievement. Experiment 2 (n = 266) investigated the usage pattern of autonomous on-demand help, demonstrating that fully learner-controlled AI feedback significantly enhanced academic performance for high-achieving students (d = 0.378, p < 0.05) without negatively impacting their autonomy. However, autonomy notably declined among lower achievers exposed to on-demand AI interventions (d = -0.383, p < 0.05), particularly in the technical-psychological dimension (d = -0.549, p < 0.05), which has a large overlap with self-regulation. These findings underscore the importance of usage patterns when applying GAI-powered personalized feedback to students.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit human-like intelligence, enabling them to simulate human behavior and support various applications that require both humanized communication and extensive knowledge reserves. Efforts are made to personify LLMs with special training data or hand-crafted prompts, while correspondingly faced with challenges such as insufficient data usage or rigid behavior patterns. Consequently, personified LLMs fail to capture personified knowledge or express persistent opinion. To fully unlock the potential of LLM personification, we propose PersLLM, a framework for better data construction and model tuning. For insufficient data usage, we incorporate strategies such as Chain-of-Thought prompting and anti-induction, improving the quality of data construction and capturing the personality experiences, knowledge, and thoughts more comprehensively. For rigid behavior patterns, we design the tuning process and introduce automated DPO to enhance the specificity and dynamism of the models' personalities, which leads to a more natural opinion communication. Both automated metrics and expert human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Case studies in human-machine interactions and multi-agent systems further suggest potential application scenarios and future directions for LLM personification.",

    "summary": "Location Intelligence (LI), the science of transforming location-centric geospatial data into actionable knowledge, has become a cornerstone of modern spatial decision-making. The rapid evolution of Geospatial Representation Learning is fundamentally reshaping LI development through two successive technological revolutions: the deep learning breakthrough and the emerging large language model (LLM) paradigm. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in automated feature extraction from structured geospatial data (e.g., satellite imagery, GPS trajectories), the recent integration of LLMs introduces transformative capabilities for cross-modal geospatial reasoning and unstructured geo-textual data processing. This survey presents a comprehensive review of geospatial representation learning across both technological eras, organizing them into a structured taxonomy based on the complete pipeline comprising: (1) data perspective, (2) methodological perspective and (3) application perspective. We also highlight current advancements, discuss existing limitations, and propose potential future research directions in the LLM era.

By integrating RDF and SPARQL-based querying, the system enhances the accessibility and interpretability of procurement records, enabling complex semantic queries and advanced analytics. Furthermore, by incorporating machine learning-driven predictive modeling, the system extends beyond conventional data analysis, offering insights into procurement trends and risk assessment.

    "summary": "Timeseries monitoring systems such as Prometheus play a crucial role in gaining observability of the underlying system components. These systems collect timeseries metrics from various system components and perform monitoring queries over periodic window-based aggregations (i.e., rule queries). However, despite wide adoption, the operational costs and query latency of rule queries remain high. In this paper, we identify major bottlenecks associated with repeated data scans and query computations concerning window overlaps in rule queries, and present PromSketch, an approximation-first query framework as intermediate caches for monitoring systems. It enables low operational costs and query latency, by combining approximate window-based query frameworks and sketch-based precomputation. PromSketch is implemented as a standalone module that can be integrated into Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics, covering 70% of Prometheus' aggregation over time queries. Our evaluation shows that PromSketch achieves up to a two orders of magnitude reduction in query latency over Prometheus and VictoriaMetrics, while lowering operational dollar costs of query processing by two orders of magnitude compared to Prometheus and by at least 4x compared to VictoriaMetrics with at most 5% average errors across statistics.

This paper explores a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach to evaluate and prioritize process models by incorporating both quantitative metrics (e.g., fitness, precision) and qualitative factors (e.g., cultural fit). An illustrative logistics example demonstrates how MCDM, specifically the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), facilitates trade-off analysis and promotes alignment with managerial objectives. Initial insights suggest that the MCDM approach enhances context-sensitive decision-making, as selected models address both operational metrics and broader managerial needs. While this study is an early-stage exploration, it provides an initial foundation for deeper exploration of MCDM-driven strategies to enhance the role of process mining in complex organizational settings.",

    "summary": "Scheduling All-to-All communications efficiently is fundamental to minimizing job completion times in distributed systems. Incast and straggler flows can slow down All-to-All transfers; and GPU clusters bring additional straggler challenges due to highly heterogeneous link capacities between technologies like NVLink and Ethernet. Existing schedulers all suffer high overheads relative to theoretically optimal transfers. Classical, simple scheduling algorithms such as SpreadOut fail to minimize transfer completion times; modern optimization-based schedulers such as TACCL achieve better completion times but with computation times that can be orders of magnitude longer than the transfer itself. This paper presents FLASH, which schedules near-optimal All-to-All transfers with a simple, polynomial time algorithm. FLASH keeps the bottleneck inter-server network maximally utilized and, in the background, shuffles data between GPUs over fast intra-server networks to mitigate stragglers. We prove that, so long as intra-server networks are significantly faster than inter-server networks, FLASH approaches near-optimal transfer completion times. We implement FLASH and demonstrate that its computational overheads are negligible, yet it achieves transfer completion times that are comparable to state-of-the-art solver-based schedulers.",

    "summary": "AI power demand is growing unprecedentedly thanks to the high power density of AI compute and the emerging inferencing workload. On the supply side, abundant wind power is waiting for grid access in interconnection queues. In this light, this paper argues bringing AI workload to modular compute clusters co-located in wind farms. Our deployment right-sizing strategy makes it economically viable to deploy more than 6 million high-end GPUs today that could consume cheap, green power at its source. We built Heron, a cross-site software router, that could efficiently leverage the complementarity of power generation across wind farms by routing AI inferencing workload around power drops. Using 1-week ofcoding and conversation production traces from Azure and (real) variable wind power traces, we show how Heron improves aggregate goodput of AI compute by up to 80% compared to the state-of-the-art.",

    "summary": "With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), serving LLM inference requests has become an increasingly important task, attracting active research advancements. Practical workloads play an essential role in this process: they are critical for motivating and benchmarking serving techniques and systems. However, the existing understanding of real-world LLM serving workloads is limited due to the lack of a comprehensive workload characterization. Prior analyses remain insufficient in scale and scope, thus failing to fully capture intricate workload characteristics.\nIn this paper, we fill the gap with an in-depth characterization of LLM serving workloads collected from our worldwide cloud inference serving service, covering not only language models but also emerging multimodal and reasoning models, and unveiling important new findings in each case. Moreover, based on our findings, we propose ServeGen, a principled framework for generating realistic LLM serving workloads by composing them on a per-client basis. A practical use case in production validates that ServeGen avoids 50% under-provisioning compared to naive workload generation, demonstrating ServeGen's advantage in performance benchmarking. We will open-source ServeGen to foster future research.",

    "summary": "Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, such as autonomous robots and intelligent vehicles, are increasingly reliant on diverse heterogeneous accelerators (e.g., GPGPUs, NPUs, FPGAs) to meet stringent real-time processing and energy-efficiency demands. However, the proliferation of vendor-specific proprietary communication libraries creates significant interoperability barriers, hindering seamless collaboration between different accelerator types and leading to suboptimal resource utilization and performance bottlenecks in distributed AI workloads. This paper introduces KAITIAN, a novel distributed communication framework designed to bridge this gap. KAITIAN provides a unified abstraction layer that intelligently integrates vendor-optimized communication libraries for intra-group efficiency with general-purpose communication protocols for inter-group interoperability. Crucially, it incorporates a load-adaptive scheduling mechanism that dynamically balances computational tasks across heterogeneous devices based on their real-time performance characteristics. Implemented as an extension to PyTorch and rigorously evaluated on a testbed featuring NVIDIA GPUs and Cambricon MLUs, KAITIAN demonstrates significant improvements in resource utilization and scalability for distributed training tasks. Experimental results show that KAITIAN can accelerate training time by up to 42% compared to baseline homogeneous systems, while incurring minimal communication overhead (2.8--4.3%) and maintaining model accuracy. KAITIAN paves the way for more flexible and powerful heterogeneous computing in complex embodied AI applications.",

    "summary": "In this article, we show that the now classical protocol complex approach to distributed task solvability of Herlihy et al. can be understood in standard categorical terms. First, protocol complexes are functors, from chromatic (semi-) simplicial sets to chromatic simplicial sets, that naturally give rise to algebras. These algebras describe the next state operator for the corresponding distributed systems. This is constructed for semi-synchronous distributed systems with general patterns of communication for which we show that these functors are always Yoneda extensions of simpler functors, implying a number of interesting properties. Furthermore, for these protocol complex functors, we prove the existence of a free algebra on any initial chromatic simplicial complex, modeling iterated protocol complexes. Under this categorical formalization, protocol complexes are seen as transition systems, where states are structured as chromatic simplicial sets. We exploit the epistemic interpretation of chromatic simplicial sets and the underlying transition system (or algebra) structure to introduce a temporal-epistemic logic and its semantics on all free algebras on chromatic simplicial sets. We end up by giving hints on how to extend this framework to more general dynamic network graphs and state-dependent protocols, and give example in fault-tolerant distributed systems and mobile robotics.",

    "summary": "Python demonstrates lower performance in comparison to traditional high performance computing (HPC) languages such as C, C++, and Fortran. This performance gap is largely due to Python's interpreted nature and the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which hampers multithreading efficiency. However, the latest version of Python includes the necessary changes to make the interpreter thread-safe, allowing Python code to run without the GIL. This important update will enable users to fully exploit multithreading parallelism in Python. In order to facilitate that task, this paper introduces OMP4Py, the first pure Python implementation of OpenMP. We demonstrate that it is possible to bring OpenMP's familiar directive-based parallelization paradigm to Python, allowing developers to write parallel code with the same level of control and flexibility as in C, C++, or Fortran. The experimental evaluation shows that OMP4Py significantly impacts the performance of various types of applications, although the current threading limitation of Python's interpreter (v3.13) reduce its effectiveness for numerical applications.",

    "summary": "Speculative inference is a promising paradigm employing small speculative models (SSMs) as drafters to generate draft tokens, which are subsequently verified in parallel by the target large language model (LLM). This approach enhances the efficiency of inference serving by reducing LLM inference latency and costs while preserving generation quality. However, existing speculative methods face critical challenges, including inefficient resource utilization and limited draft acceptance, which constrain their scalability and overall effectiveness. To overcome these obstacles, we present CoSine, a novel speculative inference system that decouples sequential speculative decoding from parallel verification, enabling efficient collaboration among multiple nodes. Specifically, CoSine routes inference requests to specialized drafters based on their expertise and incorporates a confidence-based token fusion mechanism to synthesize outputs from cooperating drafters, ensuring high-quality draft generation. Additionally, CoSine dynamically orchestrates the execution of speculative decoding and verification in a pipelined manner, employing batch scheduling to selectively group requests and adaptive speculation control to minimize idle periods. By optimizing parallel workflows through heterogeneous node collaboration, CoSine balances draft generation and verification throughput in real-time, thereby maximizing resource utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that CoSine achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art speculative approaches. Notably, with equivalent resource costs, CoSine achieves up to a 23.2% decrease in latency and a 32.5% increase in throughput compared to baseline methods.",

In this paper, we propose Legend, a lightweight heterogeneous system for graph embedding that systematically redefines data management across CPU, GPU, and NVMe SSD resources. Legend is built on a foundation of efficient data placement and retrieval strategies tailored to the unique strengths of each hardware. Key innovations include a prefetch-friendly embedding loading strategy, enabling GPUs to directly prefetch data from SSDs with minimal I/O overhead, and a high-throughput GPU-SSD direct access driver optimized for graph embedding tasks. Furthermore, we propose a customized parallel execution strategy to maximize GPU utilization, ensuring efficient handling of billion-scale datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Legend achieves up to 4.8x speedup compared to state-of-the-art systems. Moreover, Legend exhibits comparable performance on a single GPU to that of the state-of-the-art system using 4 GPUs on the billion-scale dataset.",

Our tool estimates LLM inference performance metrics for the given scenario. We have validated against real hardware platforms running various different LLM models, achieving a max geomean error of this http URL use GenZ to identify compute, memory capacity, memory bandwidth, network latency, and network bandwidth requirements across diverse LLM inference use cases. We also study diverse architectural choices in use today (inspired by LLM serving platforms from several vendors) to help inform computer architects designing next-generation AI hardware accelerators and platforms. The trends and insights derived from GenZ can guide AI engineers deploying LLMs as well as computer architects designing next-generation hardware accelerators and platforms.

    "summary": "Space-ground integrated networks hold great promise for providing global connectivity, particularly in remote areas where large amounts of valuable data are generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, but lacking terrestrial communication infrastructure. The massive data is conventionally transferred to the cloud server for centralized artificial intelligence (AI) models training, raising huge communication overhead and privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a hierarchical learning and computing framework, which leverages the lowlatency characteristic of low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites and the global coverage of geostationary-earth-orbit (GEO) satellites, to provide global aggregation services for locally trained models on ground IoT devices. Due to the time-varying nature of satellite network topology and the energy constraints of LEO satellites, efficiently aggregating the received local models from ground devices on LEO satellites is highly challenging. By leveraging the predictability of inter-satellite connectivity, modeling the space network as a directed graph, we formulate a network energy minimization problem for model aggregation, which turns out to be a Directed Steiner Tree (DST) problem. We propose a topologyaware energy-efficient routing (TAEER) algorithm to solve the DST problem by finding a minimum spanning arborescence on a substitute directed graph. Extensive simulations under realworld space-ground integrated network settings demonstrate that the proposed TAEER algorithm significantly reduces energy consumption and outperforms benchmarks.",

To tackle this challenge, most current CFL approaches rely on extensive rehearsal of previous data. Despite effectiveness, rehearsal comes at a cost to memory, and it may also violate data privacy. Considering these, we seek to apply regularization techniques to CFL by considering their cost-efficient properties that do not require sample caching or rehearsal. Specifically, we first apply traditional regularization techniques to CFL and observe that existing regularization techniques, especially synaptic intelligence, can achieve promising results under homogeneous data distribution but fail when the data is heterogeneous. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective regularization algorithm for CFL named FedSSI, which tailors the synaptic intelligence for the CFL with heterogeneous data settings. FedSSI can not only reduce computational overhead without rehearsal but also address the data heterogeneity issue. Extensive experiments show that FedSSI achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

In this work, we introduce the architecture of the Tianyu pipeline and use relative photometry as a case to demonstrate its high scalability and efficiency. This pipeline is tested on the data collected from Muguang observatory and Xinglong observatory. The pipeline demonstrates high scalability, with most processing stages increasing in throughput as the number of consumers grows. Compared to a single consumer, the median throughput of image calibration, alignment, and flux extraction increases by 41%, 257%, and 107% respectively when using 5 consumers, while image stacking exhibits limited scalability due to I/O constraints. In our tests, the pipeline was able to detect two transiting sources. Besides, the pipeline captures variability in the light curves of nine known and two previously unknown variable sources in the testing data. Meanwhile, the differential photometric precision of the light curves is near the theoretical limitation. These results indicate that this pipeline is suitable for detecting transiting exoplanets and variable stars. This work builds the fundation for further development of Tianyu software.

    "summary": "Graph Coloring consists in assigning colors to vertices ensuring that two adjacent vertices do not have the same color. In dynamic graphs, this notion is not well defined, as we need to decide if different colors for adjacent vertices must happen all the time or not, and how to go from a coloring in one time to the next one.\nIn this paper, we define a coloring notion for Temporal Graphs where at each step, the coloring must be proper. It uses a notion of compatibility between two consecutive snapshots that implies that the coloring stays proper while the transition happens. Given a graph, the minimum number of colors needed to ensure that such coloring exists is the \\emph{Temporal Chromatic Number} of this graph.\nWith those notions, we provide some lower and upper bounds for the temporal chromatic number in the general case. We then dive into some specific classes of graphs such as trees, graphs with bounded degree or bounded degeneracy. Finally, we consider temporal graphs where grow pace is one, that is, a single edge can be added and a single other one can be removed between two time steps. In that case, we consider bipartite and bounded degree graphs.\nEven though the problem is defined with full knowledge of the temporal graph, our results also work in the case where future snapshots are given online: we need to choose the coloring of the next snapshot after having computed the current one, not knowing what",

    "summary": "Resource allocation problems in which demand is splittable are usually solved using different solution methods from their unsplittable equivalents. Although splittable problem instances can be the easier of the two (for example, they might simply correspond to a linear relaxation of a discrete problem), there exist many problems, including routing problems, for which the converse is true. That is, the technology for solving unsplittable problems is mature, but the splittable counterpart is not. For such problems, one strategy that has recently shown potential is the use of an a priori splitting rule in which each customer's demand is split into smaller pieces in advance, which enables one to simply solve the splittable problem as an instance of the unsplittable version. An important factor to consider is the number of pieces that result after this splitting. A large numbers of pieces will allow more splitting patterns to be realizable, but will result in a larger problem instance. In this paper, we introduce a splitting rule that minimizes the number of pieces, subject to the constraint that all demand splitting patterns remain feasible. Computational experiments on benchmark instances for the vehicle routing problem and a time-windows extension show that the solution quality of our proposed splitting rule can match the performance of existing approaches.",

    "summary": "Aggregating multiple input rankings into a consensus ranking is essential in various fields such as social choice theory, hiring, college admissions, web search, and databases. A major challenge is that the optimal consensus ranking might be biased against individual candidates or groups, especially those from marginalized communities. This concern has led to recent studies focusing on fairness in rank aggregation. The goal is to ensure that candidates from different groups are fairly represented in the top-$k$ positions of the aggregated ranking.\nWe study this fair rank aggregation problem by considering the Kendall tau as the underlying metric. While we know of a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the classical rank aggregation problem, the corresponding fair variant only possesses a quite straightforward 3-approximation algorithm due to Wei et al., SIGMOD'22, and Chakraborty et al., NeurIPS'22, which finds closest fair ranking for each input ranking and then simply outputs the best one.\nIn this paper, we first provide a novel algorithm that achieves $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation (for any $\\epsilon > 0$), significantly improving over the 3-approximation bound. Next, we provide a $2.881$-approximation fair rank aggregation algorithm that works irrespective of the fairness notion, given one can find a closest fair ranking, beating the 3-approximation bound. We complement our theoretical guarantee by performing extensive experiments on various real-world datasets to establish the effectiveness of our algorithm further by comparing it with the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms.",

    "summary": "We provide a dual fitting technique on a semidefinite program yielding simple proofs of tight bounds for the robust price of anarchy of several congestion and scheduling games under the sum of weighted completion times objective. The same approach also allows to bound the approximation ratio of local search algorithms for the scheduling problem $R || \\sum w_j C_j$. All of our results are obtained through a simple unified dual fitting argument on the same semidefinite programming relaxation, which can essentially be obtained through the first round of the Lasserre/Sum of Squares hierarchy.\nAs our main application, we show that the known coordination ratio bounds of respectively $4, (3 + \\sqrt{5})/2 \\approx 2.618,$ and $32/15 \\approx 2.133$ for the scheduling game $R || \\sum w_j C_j$ under the coordination mechanisms Smith's Rule, Proportional Sharing and Rand (STOC 2011) can be extended to congestion games and obtained through this approach. For the natural restriction where the weight of each player is proportional to its processing time on every resource, we show that the last bound can be improved from 2.133 to 2. This improvement can also be made for general instances when considering the price of anarchy of the game, rather than the coordination ratio. As a further application of the technique, we show that it recovers the tight bound of $(3 + \\sqrt{5})/2$ for the price of anarchy of weighted affine congestion games and the Kawaguchi-Kyan bound of $(1+ \\sqrt{2})/2$ for the pure price of anarchy of $P || \\sum w_j C_j$. In addition, this approach recovers the known tight approximation ratio of $(3 + \\sqrt{5})/2 \\approx 2.618$ for a natural local search algorithm for $R || \\sum w_j C_j$, as well as the best currently known combinatorial approximation algorithm for this problem achieving an approximation ratio of $(5 + \\sqrt{5})/4 + \\varepsilon \\approx 1.809 + \\varepsilon$.",

    "summary": "We study learning-augmented binary search trees (BSTs) via Treaps with carefully designed priorities. The result is a simple search tree in which the depth of each item $x$ is determined by its predicted weight $w_x$. Specifically, each item $x$ is assigned a composite priority of $-\\lfloor\\log\\log(1/w_x)\\rfloor + U(0, 1)$ where $U(0, 1)$ is the uniform random variable. By choosing $w_x$ as the relative frequency of $x$, the resulting search trees achieve static optimality. This approach generalizes the recent learning-augmented BSTs [Lin-Luo-Woodruff ICML '22], which only work for Zipfian distributions, by extending them to arbitrary input distributions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can be generalized to a B-Tree data structure using the B-Treap approach [Golovin ICALP '09]. Our search trees are also capable of leveraging localities in the access sequence through online self-reorganization, thereby achieving the working-set property. Additionally, they are robust to prediction errors and support dynamic operations, such as insertions, deletions, and prediction updates. We complement our analysis with an empirical study, demonstrating that our method outperforms prior work and classic data structures.",

    "summary": "We study the internal dictionary matching (IDM) problem where a dictionary $\\mathcal{D}$ containing $d$ substrings of a text $T$ is given, and each query concerns the occurrences of patterns in $\\mathcal{D}$ in another substring of $T$. We propose a novel $O(n)$-sized data structure named Basic Substring Structure (BASS) where $n$ is the length of the text $T.$ With BASS, we are able to handle all types of queries in the IDM problem in nearly optimal query and preprocessing time. Specifically, our results include:\n$\\bullet$ The first algorithm that answers the CountDistinct query in $\\tilde{O}(1)$ time with $\\tilde{O}(n+d)$ preprocessing, where we need to compute the number of distinct patterns that exist in $T[l,r]$. Previously, the best result was $\\tilde{O}(m)$ time per query after $\\tilde{O}(n^2/m+d)$ or $\\tilde{O}(nd/m+d)$ preprocessing, where $m$ is a chosen parameter.\n$\\bullet$ Faster algorithms for two other types of internal queries. We improve the runtime for (1) Occurrence counting (Count) queries to $O(\\log n/\\log\\log n)$ time per query with $O(n+d\\sqrt{\\log n})$ preprocessing from $O(\\log^2 n/\\log\\log n)$ time per query with $O(n\\log n/\\log \\log n+d\\log^{3/2} n)$ preprocessing. (2) Distinct pattern reporting (ReportDistinct) queries to $O(1+|\\text{output}|)$ time per query from $O(\\log n+|\\text{output}|)$ per query.\nIn addition, we match the optimal runtime in the remaining two types of queries, pattern existence (Exists), and occurrence reporting (Report). We also show that BASS is more generally applicable to other internal query problems.",

    "summary": "We study the online metric matching problem. There are $m$ servers and $n$ requests located in a metric space, where all servers are available upfront and requests arrive one at a time. Upon the arrival of a new request, it needs to be immediately and irrevocably matched to a free server, resulting in a cost of their distance. The objective is to minimize the total matching cost.\nWhen servers are adversarial and requests are independently drawn from a known distribution, we reduce the problem to a more accessible setting where all servers and requests are independently drawn from the same distribution. Applying our reduction, for the Euclidean space $[0, 1]^d$ with various choices of distributions, we achieve improved competitive ratios and nearly optimal regrets in both balanced and unbalanced markets. In particular, we give $O(1)$-competitive algorithms for $d \\geq 3$ in both balanced and unbalanced markets with smooth distributions. Our algorithms improve on the $O((\\log \\log \\log n)^2)$ competitive ratio of Gupta et al. (ICALP'19) for balanced markets in various regimes, and provide the first positive results for unbalanced markets.\nMoreover, when the servers and requests are adversarial and a prediction of request locations is provided, for balanced markets, we present a general framework for transforming an arbitrary algorithm that does not use predictions into an algorithm that leverages predictions. The competitive ratio of the resulting algorithm is a constant with a perfect prediction and degrades smoothly as the prediction accuracy deteriorates, while preserving the worst-case guarantee.",

Previous work has presented differentially private algorithms for many graph problems that can handle insertions only or deletions only (called partially dynamic algorithms) and obtained some hardness results for the fully dynamic setting. The only algorithms in the latter setting were for the edge count, given by Fichtenberger, Henzinger, and Ost (ESA 21), and for releasing the values of all graph cuts, given by Fichtenberger, Henzinger, and Upadhyay (ICML 23). We provide the first differentially private and fully dynamic graph algorithms for several other fundamental graph statistics (including the triangle count, the number of connected components, the size of the maximum matching, and the degree histogram), analyze their error and show strong lower bounds on the error for all algorithms in this setting. We study two variants of edge differential privacy for fully dynamic graph algorithms: event-level and item-level. We give upper and lower bounds on the error of both event-level and item-level fully dynamic algorithms for several fundamental graph problems. No fully dynamic algorithms that are private at the item-level (the more stringent of the two notions) were known before. In the case of item-level privacy, for several problems, our algorithms match our lower bounds.",

    "summary": "Maximizing a single submodular set function subject to a cardinality constraint is a well-studied and central topic in combinatorial optimization. However, finding a set that maximizes multiple functions at the same time is much less understood, even though it is a formulation which naturally occurs in robust maximization or problems with fairness considerations such as fair influence maximization or fair allocation.\nIn this work, we consider the problem of maximizing the minimum over many submodular functions, which is known as multiobjective submodular maximization. All known polynomial-time approximation algorithms either obtain a weak approximation guarantee or rely on the evaluation of the multilinear extension. The latter is expensive to evaluate and renders such algorithms impractical. We bridge this gap and introduce the first scalable and practical algorithm that obtains the best-known approximation guarantee. We furthermore introduce a novel application fair centrality maximization and show how it can be addressed via multiobjective submodular maximization. In our experimental evaluation, we show that our algorithm outperforms known algorithms in terms of objective value and running time.",

    "summary": "The Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving combinatorial optimisation problems. QAOA encodes solutions into the ground state of a Hamiltonian, approximated by a $p$-level parameterised quantum circuit composed of problem and mixer Hamiltonians, with parameters optimised classically. While deeper QAOA circuits can offer greater accuracy, practical applications are constrained by complex parameter optimisation and physical limitations such as gate noise, restricted qubit connectivity, and state-preparation-and-measurement errors, limiting implementations to shallow depths. This work focuses on QAOA$_1$ (QAOA at $p=1$) for QUBO problems, represented as Ising models. Despite QAOA$_1$ having only two parameters, $(\\gamma, \\beta)$, we show that their optimisation is challenging due to a highly oscillatory landscape, with oscillation rates increasing with the problem size, density, and weight. This behaviour necessitates high-resolution grid searches to avoid distortion of cost landscapes that may result in inaccurate minima. We propose an efficient optimisation strategy that reduces the two-dimensional $(\\gamma, \\beta)$ search to a one-dimensional search over $\\gamma$, with $\\beta^*$ computed analytically. We establish the maximum permissible sampling period required to accurately map the $\\gamma$ landscape and provide an algorithm to estimate the optimal parameters in polynomial time. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that for regular graphs on average, the globally optimal $\\gamma^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$ values are concentrated very close to zero and coincide with the first local optimum, enabling gradient descent to replace exhaustive line searches. This approach is validated using Recursive QAOA (RQAOA), where it consistently outperforms both coarsely optimised RQAOA and semidefinite programs across all tested QUBO instances.",

However, this result is notoriously evasive in terms of efficient constructions, and it is still unknown whether such a partition can be computed in polynomial time, even for $k = 5$.\nWe make progress towards an efficient constructive version of the Gy≈ëri--Lov√°sz theorem by considering a natural strengthening of the $k$-connectivity requirement. Specifically, we show that the desired connected partition can be found in polynomial time, if $G$ contains $k$ disjoint connected dominating sets. As a consequence of this result, we give several efficient approximate and exact constructive versions of the original Gy≈ëri--Lov√°sz theorem:\n1. On general graphs, a Gy≈ëri--Lov√°sz partition with $k$ parts can be computed in polynomial time when the input graph has connectivity $\\Omega(k \\cdot \\log^2 n)$;\n2. On convex bipartite graphs, connectivity of $4k$ is sufficient;\n3. On biconvex graphs and interval graphs, connectivity of $k$ is sufficient, meaning that our algorithm gives a ``true'' constructive version of the theorem on these graph classes.",

Despite recent learning-based efforts to approximate GED via vector space representations, existing methods struggle with adapting to varying operation costs. Furthermore, they suffer from inefficient, reactive mapping refinements due to reliance on isolated node-level distance as guidance. To address these issues, we propose GEN, a novel learning-based approach for flexible GED approximation. GEN addresses the varying costs adaptation by integrating operation costs prior to match establishment, enabling mappings to dynamically adapt to cost variations. Furthermore, GEN introduces a proactive guidance optimization strategy that captures graph-level dependencies between matches, allowing informed matching decisions in a single step without costly iterative refinements. Extensive evaluations on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GEN achieves up to 37.8% reduction in GED approximation error and 72.7% reduction in inference time compared with state-of-the-art methods, while consistently maintaining robustness under diverse cost settings and graph sizes.",

On the other hand, such networks are also used as an analogy of transport networks such as electrical power grids to answer the question of how exactly such critical dynamic states can be avoided. However, simulating large network of coupled oscillators is computationally intensive, with specifc regards to electronic ones. We have developed an integrated circuit using integrated Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) with modifications, that allows to flexibly vary the topology as well as a complexity parameter of the network during operation. The proposed architecture, inspired by the brain, employs a clustered architecture, with each cluster containing 7 PLLs featuring programmable coupling mechanisms.

However, the stochastic nature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different model configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work, we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI surrogate of a CPM used to investigate \\textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. We describe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that define unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this classifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model surrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference configuration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational time as compared to native code execution.

Among QML approaches, variational quantum circuits (VQCs), also known as quantum neural networks (QNNs), have shown promise both empirically and theoretically. However, their broader adoption is hindered by reliance on quantum hardware during inference. Hardware imperfections and limited access to quantum devices pose practical challenges. To address this, the Quantum-Train (QT) framework leverages the exponential scaling of quantum amplitudes to generate classical neural network parameters, enabling inference without quantum hardware and achieving significant parameter compression. Yet, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for such quantum-enhanced neural programmers remains non-trivial and often requires expertise in quantum information science. In this paper, we propose an automated solution using differentiable optimization. Our method jointly optimizes both conventional circuit parameters and architectural parameters in an end-to-end manner via automatic differentiation. We evaluate the proposed framework on classification, time-series prediction, and reinforcement learning tasks. Simulation results show that our method matches or outperforms manually designed QNN architectures.

    "summary": "As demand for intelligent services rises and edge devices become more capable, distributed learning at the network edge has emerged as a key enabling technology. While existing paradigms like federated learning (FL) and decentralized FL (DFL) enable privacy-preserving distributed learning in many scenarios, they face potential challenges in connectivity and synchronization imposed by resource-constrained and infrastructure-less environments. While more robust, gossip learning (GL) algorithms have generally been designed for homogeneous data distributions and may not suit all contexts. This paper introduces Chisme, a novel suite of protocols designed to address the challenges of implementing robust intelligence in the network edge, characterized by heterogeneous data distributions, episodic connectivity, and lack of infrastructure. Chisme includes both synchronous DFL (Chisme-DFL) and asynchronous GL (Chisme-GL) variants that enable collaborative yet decentralized model training that considers underlying data heterogeneity. We introduce a data similarity heuristic that allows agents to opportunistically infer affinity with each other using the existing communication of model updates in decentralized FL and GL. We leverage the heuristic to extend DFL's model aggregation and GL's model merge mechanisms for better personalized training while maintaining collaboration. While Chisme-DFL is a synchronous decentralized approach whose resource utilization scales linearly with network size, Chisme-GL is fully asynchronous and has a lower, constant resource requirement independent of network size. We demonstrate that Chisme methods outperform their standard counterparts in model training over distributed and heterogeneous data in network scenarios ranging from less connected and reliable networks to fully connected and lossless networks.",

However, such hybrid models appear to be very sensitive to the data encoding used at the interface of a neural network and a quantum circuit, with suboptimal choices leading to stability issues. To address this problem, we propose a novel strategy that uses a normalization function based on a moderated gradient version of the $\\tanh$. This method transforms the outputs of the neural networks without concentrating them at the extreme value ranges. Our idea was evaluated on a dataset of gene expression and drug response measurements for various cancer cell lines, where we compared the prediction performance of a classical deep learning model and several QHML models. These results confirmed that QHML performed better than the classical models when data was optimally normalized. This study opens up new possibilities for biomedical data analysis using quantum computers.",

    "summary": "High energy consumption of artificial intelligence has gained momentum worldwide, which necessitates major investments on expanding efficient and carbon-neutral generation and data center infrastructure in electric power grids. Going beyond the conventional ideation, this article unleashes innate computational abilities in the power grid network circuits itself. By programming power electronic converters (PECs) to mimic biological neurons, we sustainably transform power grids into a neural network and enable it to optimize, compute and make data-driven decisions using distributed PECs. Instead of seen merely as an energy delivery platform, this article conceptualizes a novel application for electric grid to be used as a computing asset without affecting its operation. To illustrate its computational abilities, we solve a affine transformation task in a microgrid with five PECs. By encoding the digital data into the control of PECs, our preliminary results conclude that computing using electric grids does not disturb its operation. From a scientific perspective, this work fundamentally merges energy and computing optimization theories by harnessing inherent high-dimensional computational relationships in electric grids.",

    "summary": "The Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving combinatorial optimisation problems. QAOA encodes solutions into the ground state of a Hamiltonian, approximated by a $p$-level parameterised quantum circuit composed of problem and mixer Hamiltonians, with parameters optimised classically. While deeper QAOA circuits can offer greater accuracy, practical applications are constrained by complex parameter optimisation and physical limitations such as gate noise, restricted qubit connectivity, and state-preparation-and-measurement errors, limiting implementations to shallow depths. This work focuses on QAOA$_1$ (QAOA at $p=1$) for QUBO problems, represented as Ising models. Despite QAOA$_1$ having only two parameters, $(\\gamma, \\beta)$, we show that their optimisation is challenging due to a highly oscillatory landscape, with oscillation rates increasing with the problem size, density, and weight. This behaviour necessitates high-resolution grid searches to avoid distortion of cost landscapes that may result in inaccurate minima. We propose an efficient optimisation strategy that reduces the two-dimensional $(\\gamma, \\beta)$ search to a one-dimensional search over $\\gamma$, with $\\beta^*$ computed analytically. We establish the maximum permissible sampling period required to accurately map the $\\gamma$ landscape and provide an algorithm to estimate the optimal parameters in polynomial time. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that for regular graphs on average, the globally optimal $\\gamma^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$ values are concentrated very close to zero and coincide with the first local optimum, enabling gradient descent to replace exhaustive line searches. This approach is validated using Recursive QAOA (RQAOA), where it consistently outperforms both coarsely optimised RQAOA and semidefinite programs across all tested QUBO instances.",

These systems come with the system-software challenge that the intermittently powered IoT devices have to checkpoint their state in non-volatile memory to later resume with this state when sufficient energy is available. The scarce energy resources demand that only modified data is persisted before a power failure, which requires precise modification tracking.\nWe present vNV-Heap, the first ownership-based virtually Non-Volatile Heap for intermittently powered systems with guaranteed power-failure resilience. The heap exploits ownership systems, a zero-cost (i.e., compile-time) abstraction for example implemented by Rust, to track modifications and virtualize object persistence. To achieve power-failure resilience, our heap is designed and implemented to guarantee bounded operations by static program code analysis: For example, the heap allows for determining a worst-case energy consumption for the operation of persisting modified and currently volatile objects. The evaluation of our open-source implementation on an embedded hardware platform (i.e., ESP32-C3) shows that using our heap abstraction is more energy efficient than existing approaches while also providing runtime guarantees by static worst-case bounds.",

However, for 3D physical tasks such as this, generating sufficient repeated practice opportunities for learners can be challenging, in part because it is difficult for novices to reconfigure the physical object to specific states. We propose Rubikon, an intelligent tutoring system for learning to solve the Rubik's Cube. Rubikon reduces the necessity for repeated manual configurations of the Rubik's Cube without compromising the tactile experience of handling a physical cube. The foundational design of Rubikon is an AR setup, where learners manipulate a physical cube while seeing an AR-rendered cube on a display. Rubikon automatically generates configurations of the Rubik's Cube to target learners' weaknesses and help them exercise diverse knowledge components. In a between-subjects experiment, we showed that Rubikon learners scored 25% higher on a post-test compared to baselines.",

We show that essential properties like anonymity and uniformity can be encoded and verified within this framework in a manner aligning with the principles of deductive software verification, where systems, properties, and proofs are expressed in a unified decidable logic. By integrating language inference techniques, we achieve full automation in synthesizing candidate bisimulation proofs for anonymity and uniformity.

In this paper, we extend that line of work, in particular to the setting of infinite words. We present a dualised syntax, yielding a notation for APAs based on right-linear lattice expressions, and provide a natural axiomatisation of their equational theory with respect to the standard language model of {\\omega}-regular languages.

    "summary": "We develop fibrational perspectives on context-free grammars and on nondeterministic finite-state automata over categories and operads. A generalized CFG is a functor from a free colored operad (aka multicategory) generated by a pointed finite species into an arbitrary base operad: this encompasses classical CFGs by taking the base to be a certain operad constructed from a free monoid, as an instance of a more general construction of an \\emph{operad of spliced arrows} $\\mathcal{W}\\,\\mathcal{C}$ for any category $\\mathcal{C}$. A generalized NFA is a functor from an arbitrary bipointed category or pointed operad satisfying the unique lifting of factorizations and finite fiber properties: this encompasses classical word automata and tree automata without $\\epsilon$-transitions, but also automata over non-free categories and operads. We show that generalized context-free and regular languages satisfy suitable generalizations of many of the usual closure properties, and in particular we give a simple conceptual proof that context-free languages are closed under intersection with regular languages. Finally, we observe that the splicing functor $\\mathcal{W} : Cat \\to Oper$ admits a left adjoint $\\mathcal{C}: Oper \\to Cat$, which we call the \\emph{contour category} construction since the arrows of $\\mathcal{C}\\,\\mathcal{O}$ have a geometric interpretation as oriented contours of operations of $\\mathcal{O}$.

    "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly become a leading technique for novel-view synthesis, providing exceptional performance through efficient software-based GPU rasterization. Its versatility enables real-time applications, including on mobile and lower-powered devices. However, 3DGS faces key challenges in virtual reality (VR): (1) temporal artifacts, such as popping during head movements, (2) projection-based distortions that result in disturbing and view-inconsistent floaters, and (3) reduced framerates when rendering large numbers of Gaussians, falling below the critical threshold for VR. Compared to desktop environments, these issues are drastically amplified by large field-of-view, constant head movements, and high resolution of head-mounted displays (HMDs). In this work, we introduce VRSplat: we combine and extend several recent advancements in 3DGS to address challenges of VR holistically. We show how the ideas of Mini-Splatting, StopThePop, and Optimal Projection can complement each other, by modifying the individual techniques and core 3DGS rasterizer. Additionally, we propose an efficient foveated rasterizer that handles focus and peripheral areas in a single GPU launch, avoiding redundant computations and improving GPU utilization. Our method also incorporates a fine-tuning step that optimizes Gaussian parameters based on StopThePop depth evaluations and Optimal Projection. We validate our method through a controlled user study with 25 participants, showing a strong preference for VRSplat over other configurations of Mini-Splatting. VRSplat is the first, systematically evaluated 3DGS approach capable of supporting modern VR applications, achieving 72+ FPS while eliminating popping and stereo-disrupting floaters.",

On the other hand, feed-forward T2V models can ensure structural regularity, yet they encounter difficulties in disentangling content and style due to limited SVG training data.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage style customization pipeline for SVG generation, making use of the advantages of both feed-forward T2V models and T2I image priors. In the first stage, we train a T2V diffusion model with a path-level representation to ensure the structural regularity of SVGs while preserving diverse expressive capabilities. In the second stage, we customize the T2V diffusion model to different styles by distilling customized T2I models. By integrating these techniques, our pipeline can generate high-quality and diverse SVGs in custom styles based on text prompts in an efficient feed-forward manner. The effectiveness of our method has been validated through extensive experiments. The project page is this https URL.",

    "summary": "The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents new opportunities to advance the cartographic process. Previous studies have either overlooked the artistic aspects of maps or faced challenges in creating both accurate and informative maps. In this study, we propose CartoAgent, a novel multi-agent cartographic framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). This framework simulates three key stages in cartographic practice: preparation, map design, and evaluation. At each stage, different MLLMs act as agents with distinct roles to collaborate, discuss, and utilize tools for specific purposes. In particular, CartoAgent leverages MLLMs' visual aesthetic capability and world knowledge to generate maps that are both visually appealing and informative. By separating style from geographic data, it can focus on designing stylesheets without modifying the vector-based data, thereby ensuring geographic accuracy. We applied CartoAgent to a specific task centered on map restyling-namely, map style transfer and evaluation. The effectiveness of this framework was validated through extensive experiments and a human evaluation study. CartoAgent can be extended to support a variety of cartographic design decisions and inform future integrations of GenAI in cartography.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces LAV (Latent Audio-Visual), a system that integrates EnCodec's neural audio compression with StyleGAN2's generative capabilities to produce visually dynamic outputs driven by pre-recorded audio. Unlike previous works that rely on explicit feature mappings, LAV uses EnCodec embeddings as latent representations, directly transformed into StyleGAN2's style latent space via randomly initialized linear mapping. This approach preserves semantic richness in the transformation, enabling nuanced and semantically coherent audio-visual translations. The framework demonstrates the potential of using pretrained audio compression models for artistic and computational applications.",

    "summary": "Reconstructing 3D clothed humans from images is fundamental to applications like virtual try-on, avatar creation, and mixed reality. While recent advances have enhanced human body recovery, accurate reconstruction of garment geometry -- especially for loose-fitting clothing -- remains an open challenge. We present a novel method for high-fidelity 3D garment reconstruction from single images that bridges 2D and 3D representations. Our approach combines Implicit Sewing Patterns (ISP) with a generative diffusion model to learn rich garment shape priors in a 2D UV space. A key innovation is our mapping model that establishes correspondences between 2D image pixels, UV pattern coordinates, and 3D geometry, enabling joint optimization of both 3D garment meshes and the corresponding 2D patterns by aligning learned priors with image observations. Despite training exclusively on synthetically simulated cloth data, our method generalizes effectively to real-world images, outperforming existing approaches on both tight- and loose-fitting garments. The reconstructed garments maintain physical plausibility while capturing fine geometric details, enabling downstream applications including garment retargeting and texture manipulation.",

    "summary": "Generative diffusion models have advanced image editing with high-quality results and intuitive interfaces such as prompts and semantic drawing. However, these interfaces lack precise control, and the associated methods typically specialize on a single editing task. We introduce a versatile, generative workflow that operates in an intrinsic-image latent space, enabling semantic, local manipulation with pixel precision for a range of editing operations. Building atop the RGB-X diffusion framework, we address key challenges of identity preservation and intrinsic-channel entanglement. By incorporating exact diffusion inversion and disentangled channel manipulation, we enable precise, efficient editing with automatic resolution of global illumination effects -- all without additional data collection or model fine-tuning. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks on complex images, including color and texture adjustments, object insertion and removal, global relighting, and their combinations.",

    "summary": "Random walks by single-node agents have been systematically conducted on various types of complex networks in order to investigate how their topologies can affect the dynamics of the agents. However, by fitting any network node, these agents do not engage in topological interactions with the network. In the present work, we describe random walks on complex networks performed by agents that are actually small graphs. These agents can only occupy admissible portions of the network onto which they fit topologically, hence their name being taken as topologically-specific agents. These agents are also allowed to move to adjacent subgraphs in the network, which have each node adjacent to a distinct original respective node of the agent. Given a network and a specific agent, it is possible to obtain a respective associated network, in which each node corresponds to a possible instance of the agent and the edges indicate adjacent positions. Associated networks are obtained and studied respectively to three types of topologically-specific agents (triangle, square, and slashed square) considering three types of complex networks (geometrical, Erd≈ës-R√©nyi, and Barab√°si-Albert). Uniform random walks are also performed on these structures, as well as networks respectively obtained by removing the five nodes with the highest degree, and studied in terms of the number of covered nodes along the walks. Several results are reported and discussed, including the fact that substantially distinct associated networks can be obtained for each of the three considered agents and for varying average node degrees. Respectively to the coverage of the networks by uniform random walks, the square agent led to the most effective coverage of the nodes, followed by the triangle and slashed square agents. In addition, the geometric network turned out to be less effectively covered.",

Our model is grounded in an underlying directed signed graph, where each link is associated with a weight that describes the strenght and nature of the interaction. The utility for each agent is an aggregation of pairwise terms determined by the weights of the signed graph in addition to an individual bias term. We consider a scenario that assumes the presence of a prominent 'cohesive' subset of players, who are either connected exclusively by positive weights, or forms a structurally balanced subset that can be bipartitioned into two adversarial subcommunities with positive intra-community and negative inter-community edges. Given the properties of the game restricted to the remaining players, our results guarantee the existence of Nash equilibria characterized by a consensus or, respectively, a polarization within the first group, as well as their stability under best response transitions. Our results can be interpreted as robustness results, building on the supermodular properties of coordination games and on a novel use of the concept of graph cohesiveness.",

In particular, each agent derives a utility equal to the number of types different from its own in its neighborhood. We show that the jump game induced by the strategic behavior of the agents (who aim to maximize their utility) may in general have improving response cycles, but is a potential game under any of the following four conditions: there are only two types of agents; or exactly one empty node; or the graph is of degree at most 2; or the graph is 3-regular and there are two empty nodes. Additionally, we show that on trees, cylinder graphs, and tori, there is always an equilibrium. Finally, we show tight bounds on the price of anarchy with respect to two different measures of diversity: the social welfare (the total utility of the agents) and the number of colorful edges (that connect agents of different types).",

    "summary": "We provide a dual fitting technique on a semidefinite program yielding simple proofs of tight bounds for the robust price of anarchy of several congestion and scheduling games under the sum of weighted completion times objective. The same approach also allows to bound the approximation ratio of local search algorithms for the scheduling problem $R || \\sum w_j C_j$. All of our results are obtained through a simple unified dual fitting argument on the same semidefinite programming relaxation, which can essentially be obtained through the first round of the Lasserre/Sum of Squares hierarchy.\nAs our main application, we show that the known coordination ratio bounds of respectively $4, (3 + \\sqrt{5})/2 \\approx 2.618,$ and $32/15 \\approx 2.133$ for the scheduling game $R || \\sum w_j C_j$ under the coordination mechanisms Smith's Rule, Proportional Sharing and Rand (STOC 2011) can be extended to congestion games and obtained through this approach. For the natural restriction where the weight of each player is proportional to its processing time on every resource, we show that the last bound can be improved from 2.133 to 2. This improvement can also be made for general instances when considering the price of anarchy of the game, rather than the coordination ratio. As a further application of the technique, we show that it recovers the tight bound of $(3 + \\sqrt{5})/2$ for the price of anarchy of weighted affine congestion games and the Kawaguchi-Kyan bound of $(1+ \\sqrt{2})/2$ for the pure price of anarchy of $P || \\sum w_j C_j$. In addition, this approach recovers the known tight approximation ratio of $(3 + \\sqrt{5})/2 \\approx 2.618$ for a natural local search algorithm for $R || \\sum w_j C_j$, as well as the best currently known combinatorial approximation algorithm for this problem achieving an approximation ratio of $(5 + \\sqrt{5})/4 + \\varepsilon \\approx 1.809 + \\varepsilon$.",

    "summary": "We study the voting problem with two alternatives where voters' preferences depend on a not-directly-observable state variable. While equilibria in the one-round voting mechanisms lead to a good decision, they are usually hard to compute and follow. We consider the two-round voting mechanism where the first round serves as a polling stage and the winning alternative only depends on the outcome of the second round. We show that the two-round voting mechanism is a powerful tool for making collective decisions. Firstly, every (approximated) equilibrium in the two-round voting mechanisms (asymptotically) leads to the decision preferred by the majority as if the state of the world were revealed to the voters. Moreover, there exist natural equilibria in the two-round game following intuitive behaviors such as informative voting, sincere voting [Austen-Smith and Banks, 1996], and the surprisingly popular strategy [Prelec et al., 2017]. This sharply contrasts with the one-round voting mechanisms in the previous literature, where no simple equilibrium is known. Finally, we show that every equilibrium in the standard one-round majority vote mechanism gives an equilibrium in the two-round mechanisms that is not more complicated than the one-round equilibrium. Therefore, the two-round voting mechanism provides a natural equilibrium in every instance, including those where one-round voting fails to have a natural solution, and it can reach an informed majority decision whenever one-round voting can. Our experiments on generative AI voters also imply that two-round voting leads to the correct outcome more often than one-round voting under some circumstances.",

We provide a theoretical result showing that, for two-player games with sufficiently many actions, the dynamics converge quickly to a cycle of length two. This cycle lies within the intersection of the neighbourhoods of two distinct Nash equilibria. For three players or more, simulations show that the dynamics converge quickly to a Nash equilibrium with high probability. Furthermore, we show that all these results are robust, in the sense that they hold in non-potential games, provided the players' payoffs are sufficiently correlated. We also compare these dynamics to gradient-based learning methods in near-potential games with three players or more, and observe that simultaneous best-response dynamics converge to a Nash equilibrium of comparable payoff substantially faster.",

The majority's preferences align with the ground truth, while the minorities disagree. Focusing on strategic behavior, we analyze situations where agents can form coalitions up to a certain capacity and adopt the concept of ex-ante Bayesian $k$-strong equilibrium, in which no group of at most $k$ agents has an incentive to deviate. Our analysis provides a complete characterization of the region where equilibria exist and yield the majority-preferred outcome when the ground truth is common knowledge. This region is defined by two key parameters: the size of the majority group and the maximum coalition capacity. When agents cannot coordinate beyond a certain threshold determined by these parameters, a stable outcome supporting the informed majority emerges. The boundary of this region exhibits several distinct segments, notably including a surprising non-linear relationship between majority size and deviation capacity. Our results reveal the complexity of the strategic behaviors in this type of voting game, which in turn demonstrate the capability of the ex-ante Bayesian $k$-strong equilibrium to provide a more detailed analysis.",

    "summary": "The allocation of resources among multiple agents is a fundamental problem in both economics and computer science. In these settings, fairness plays a crucial role in ensuring social acceptability and practical implementation of resource allocation algorithms. Traditional fair division solutions have given rise to a variety of approximate fairness notions, often as a response to the challenges posed by non-existence or computational intractability of exact solutions. However, the inherent incompatibility among these notions raises a critical question: which concept of fairness is most suitable for practical applications? In this paper, we examine two broad frameworks -- threshold-based and comparison-based fairness notions -- and evaluate their perceived fairness through a comprehensive human subject study. Our findings uncover novel insights into the interplay between perception of fairness, theoretical guarantees, the role of externalities and subjective valuations, and underlying cognitive processes, shedding light on the theory and practice of fair division.",

This study focuses on the fairness notion of envy-freeness (EF), which ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent according to their own preferences. While the existence of exact EF allocations may not always be feasible, various approximate relaxations, such as counterfactual and epistemic EF, have been proposed. Through a series of experiments with human participants, we compare perceptions of fairness between three widely studied counterfactual and epistemic relaxations of EF. Our findings indicate that allocations based on epistemic EF are perceived as fairer than those based on counterfactual relaxations. Additionally, we examine a variety of factors, including scale, balance of outcomes, and cognitive effort involved in evaluating fairness and their role in the complexity of reasoning across treatments.",

    "summary": "A well-regarded fairness notion when dividing indivisible chores is envy-freeness up to one item (EF1), which requires that pairwise envy can be eliminated by the removal of a single item. While an EF1 and Pareto optimal (PO) allocation of goods can always be found via well-known algorithms, even the existence of such solutions for chores remains open, to date. We take an epistemic approach utilizing information asymmetry by introducing dubious chores--items that inflict no cost on receiving agents but are perceived costly by others. On a technical level, dubious chores provide a more fine-grained approximation of envy-freeness than EF1. We show that finding allocations with minimal number of dubious chores is computationally hard. Nonetheless, we prove the existence of envy-free and fractional PO allocations for $n$ agents with only $2n-2$ dubious chores and strengthen it to $n-1$ dubious chores in four special classes of valuations. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that often only a few dubious chores are needed to achieve envy-freeness.",

Given that the usual notion of stability for a one-to-one market does not fit well for this associated one-to-one market, we introduce a new notion of stability. This notion allows us to establish an isomorphism between the set of stable matchings in the many-to-one market and the matchings in an associated one-to-one market that meet this new stability criterion. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of the well-known deferred acceptance algorithm to compute a matching that satisfies this new notion of stability for the associated one-to-one market.

These tamper-resistant trustless substrates allow agents to achieve self-sovereignty through ownership of cryptowallet private keys and control of digital assets and social media accounts. DeAgent eliminates centralized control and reduces human intervention, addressing key trust concerns inherent in centralized AI systems. However, given ongoing challenges in LLM reliability such as hallucinations, this creates paradoxical tension between trustlessness and unreliable autonomy.

However, VAAs' complex language and rigid presentation constrain their utility to less-sophisticated voters. While previous work enhanced VAAs' click-based interaction with scripted explanations, a conversational chatbot's potential for tailored discussion and deliberate political decision-making remains untapped. Our exploratory mixed-method study investigates how LLM-based chatbots can support voting preparation. We deployed a VAA chatbot to 331 users before Germany's 2024 European Parliament election, gathering insights from surveys, conversation logs, and 10 follow-up interviews. Participants found the VAA chatbot intuitive and informative, citing its simple language and flexible interaction. We further uncovered VAA chatbots' role as a catalyst for reflection and rationalization. Expanding on participants' desire for transparency, we provide design recommendations for building interactive and trustworthy VAA chatbots.",

    "summary": "State-of-the-art upper limb myoelectric prostheses often use pattern recognition (PR) control systems that translate electromyography (EMG) signals into desired movements. As prosthesis movement complexity increases, users often struggle to produce sufficiently distinct EMG patterns for reliable classification. Existing training typically involves heuristic, trial-and-error user adjustments to static decoder boundaries. Goal: We introduce the Reviewer, a 3D visual interface projecting EMG signals directly into the decoder's classification space, providing intuitive, real-time insight into PR algorithm behavior. This structured feedback reduces cognitive load and fosters mutual, data-driven adaptation between user-generated EMG patterns and decoder boundaries. Methods: A 10-session study with 12 able-bodied participants compared PR performance after motor-based training and updating using the Reviewer versus conventional virtual arm visualization. Performance was assessed using a Fitts law task that involved the aperture of the cursor and the control of orientation. Results: Participants trained with the Reviewer achieved higher completion rates, reduced overshoot, and improved path efficiency and throughput compared to the standard visualization group. Significance: The Reviewer introduces decoder-informed motor training, facilitating immediate and consistent PR-based myoelectric control improvements. By iteratively refining control through real-time feedback, this approach reduces reliance on trial-and-error recalibration, enabling a more adaptive, self-correcting training framework. Conclusion: The 3D visual feedback significantly improves PR control in novice operators through structured training, enabling feedback-driven adaptation and reducing reliance on extensive heuristic adjustments.",

For instance, OpenAI showcased the potential of live, multi-modal AI as an accessibility resource in 2024, yet none of the presented applications have reached BVI users, despite the technology being available since then. To promote the democratization of visual access technology development, we introduce WhatsAI, a prototype extensible framework that empowers BVI enthusiasts to leverage Meta Ray-Bans to create personalized wearable visual accessibility technologies. Our system is the first to offer a fully hackable template that integrates with WhatsApp, facilitating robust Accessible Artificial Intelligence Implementations (AAII) that enable blind users to conduct essential visual assistance tasks, such as real-time scene description, object detection, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), utilizing standard machine learning techniques and cutting-edge visual language models.

While XAI is traditionally framed around explaining individual predictions or overall system behavior, explanations also function as a form of argumentation, shaping how users evaluate system perceived usefulness, credibility, and foster appropriate trust. Rhetorical Design offers a useful framework to analyze the communicative role of explanations between AI systems and users, focusing on: (1) logical reasoning conveyed through different types of explanations, (2) credibility projected by the system and its developers, and (3) emotional resonance elicited in users. Together, these rhetorical appeals help us understand how explanations influence user perceptions and facilitate AI adoption. This paper synthesizes design strategies from prior XAI work that align with these three rhetorical appeals and highlights both opportunities and challenges of integrating rhetorical design into XAI design.",

A high-fidelity Virtual Reality environment was used to replicate real-world scenarios, allowing safe exploration of high-risk situations while focusing on the physiological impacts of work conditions. Wearable sensors were used to continuously and non-invasively collect physiological data, including electrodermal activity to monitor stress responses. Analysis of data from 18 participants revealed notable differences in EDR between light- and medium-intensity activities, reflecting variations in autonomic nervous system activity under stress. Also, a feature importance analysis revealed that peak and central tendency metrics of EDR were robust indicators of physiological responses, between light- and medium-intensity activities. The findings emphasize the relationship between AR-enabled warnings, work intensity, and worker stress, offering an approach to active stress monitoring and improved safety practices. By leveraging real-time physiological insights, this methodology has the potential to support better stress management and the development of more effective safety warning systems for roadway work zones. This research also provides valuable guidance for designing interventions to enhance worker safety, productivity, and well-being in high-risk settings.",

A 2x2 within-subject experiment (N=26) was conducted with two independent variables: AI (AI, NoAI) and Environment (Busy Hub, Quiet Library).

Following the closure of major social media APIs that previously provided free access to large-scale data (the \"post-API age\"), emerging data access programs required by the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) have sparked optimism about increased platform transparency and renewed opportunities for comprehensive research on digital platforms, leading to the \"post-post-API age.\" However, it remains unclear whether platforms provide adequate data access in practice. To assess how platforms make data available under the DSA, we conducted a comprehensive survey followed by in-depth interviews with 19 researchers to understand their experiences with data access in this new era. Our findings reveal significant challenges in accessing social media data, with researchers facing multiple barriers including complex API application processes, difficulties obtaining credentials, and limited API usability. These challenges have exacerbated existing institutional, regional, and financial inequities in data access. Based on these insights, we provide actionable recommendations for platforms, researchers, and policymakers to foster more equitable and effective data access, while encouraging broader dialogue within the CSCW community around interdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder solutions.",

In response to this challenge, we introduce SnapNCode, a novel IDE for spatial programming. SnapNCode enables programmers to capture various states of physical objects through live video streams from cameras and directly insert these visual representations into their code. Moreover, users can augment physical objects by attaching code snippets onto objects, which are opportunistically triggered when observed by cameras. We conducted a user study (N=12) to assess the usability of SnapNCode.

    "summary": "The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) presents new opportunities to advance the cartographic process. Previous studies have either overlooked the artistic aspects of maps or faced challenges in creating both accurate and informative maps. In this study, we propose CartoAgent, a novel multi-agent cartographic framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). This framework simulates three key stages in cartographic practice: preparation, map design, and evaluation. At each stage, different MLLMs act as agents with distinct roles to collaborate, discuss, and utilize tools for specific purposes. In particular, CartoAgent leverages MLLMs' visual aesthetic capability and world knowledge to generate maps that are both visually appealing and informative. By separating style from geographic data, it can focus on designing stylesheets without modifying the vector-based data, thereby ensuring geographic accuracy. We applied CartoAgent to a specific task centered on map restyling-namely, map style transfer and evaluation. The effectiveness of this framework was validated through extensive experiments and a human evaluation study. CartoAgent can be extended to support a variety of cartographic design decisions and inform future integrations of GenAI in cartography.",

Simulated environments offer a partial solution but are typically constrained by rule-based scenarios and still depend heavily on human input to guide interactions and interpret results. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced the possibility of generative agents that can simulate realistic human behavior, reasoning, and social dynamics. However, their effectiveness in modeling human-assistant interactions remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present a generative agent-based simulation platform designed to simulate human-assistant interactions. We identify ten prior studies on assistant agents that span different aspects of interaction design and replicate these studies using our simulation platform. Our results show that fully simulated experiments using generative agents can approximate key aspects of human-assistant interactions. Based on these simulations, we are able to replicate the core conclusions of the original studies. Our work provides a scalable and cost-effective approach for studying assistant agent design without requiring live human subjects. We will open source both the platform and collected results from the experiments on our website: this https URL.",

    "summary": "Modern production rates and the increasing complexity of mechanical systems require efficient and effective manufacturing and assembly processes. The transition to Industry 4.0, supported by the deployment of innovative tools such as Augmented Reality (AR), equips the industry to tackle future challenges. Among critical processes, the assembly and tightening of bolted joints stand out due to their significant safety and economic implications across various industrial sectors. This study proposes an innovative tightening method designed to enhance the reliability of bolted assembly tightening through the use of Augmented Reality and connected tools. A 6-Degrees-of-Freedom (6-DoF) tracked connected torque wrench assists the operator during tightening, ensuring each screw is tightened to the correct torque. The effectiveness of this method is compared with the conventional tightening method using paper instructions. Participants in the study carried out tightening sequences on two simple parts with multiple screws. The study evaluates the impact of the proposed method on task performance and its acceptability to operators. The tracked connected torque wrench provides considerable assistance to the operators, including wrench control and automatic generation of tightening reports. The results suggest that the AR-based method has the potential to ensure reliable torque tightening of bolted joints.",

    "summary": "The analysis of secondary quantitative data extracted from high-resolution synchrotron X-ray computed tomography scans represents a significant challenge for users. While a number of methods have been introduced for processing large three-dimensional images in order to generate secondary data, there are only a few techniques available for simple and intuitive visualization of such data in their entirety. This work employs the AccuStripes visualization technique for that purpose, which enables the visual analysis of secondary data represented by an ensemble of univariate distributions. It supports different schemes for adaptive histogram binnings in combination with several ways of rendering aggregated data and it allows the interactive selection of optimal visual representations depending on the data and the use case. We demonstrate the usability of AccuStripes on a high-resolution synchrotron scan of a particle-reinforced metal matrix composite sample, containing more than 20 million particles. Through AccuStripes, detailed insights are facilitated into distributions of derived particle characteristics of the entire sample. Furthermore, research questions such as how the overall shape of the particles is or how homogeneously they are distributed across the sample can be answered.",

    "summary": "Responsible AI (RAI) efforts increasingly emphasize the importance of addressing potential harms early in the AI development lifecycle through social-technical lenses. However, in cross-functional industry teams, this work is often stalled by a persistent knowledge handoff challenge: the difficulty of transferring high-level, early-stage technical design rationales from technical experts to non-technical or user-facing roles for ethical evaluation and harm identification. Through literature review and a co-design study with 8 practitioners, we unpack how this challenge manifests -- technical design choices are rarely handed off in ways that support meaningful engagement by non-technical roles; collaborative workflows lack shared, visual structures to support mutual understanding; and non-technical practitioners are left without scaffolds for systematic harm evaluation. Existing tools like JIRA or Google Docs, while useful for product tracking, are ill-suited for supporting joint harm identification across roles, often requiring significant extra effort to align understanding. To address this, we developed AI LEGO, a web-based prototype that supports cross-functional AI practitioners in effectively facilitating knowledge handoff and identifying harmful design choices in the early design stages. Technical roles use interactive blocks to draft development plans, while non-technical roles engage with those blocks through stage-specific checklists and LLM-driven persona simulations to surface potential harms. In a study with 18 cross-functional practitioners, AI LEGO increased the volume and likelihood of harms identified compared to baseline worksheets. Participants found that its modular structure and persona prompts made harm identification more accessible, fostering clearer and more collaborative RAI practices in early design.",

This study introduces a generation dataset by deep learning approaches (Attention Autoencoder and conditional Generative Adversarial Networks). Another problem that data heterogeneity is a critical challenge, one of the solutions is to shuffle the data to homogenize the distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the random sequence strategy significantly improves classification performance, achieving an accuracy of up to 0.70 $\\pm$ 0.03 and a macro F1 score of 0.64 $\\pm$ 0.01. For that, disrupting temporal dependencies through random sequence reordering compels the model to focus on instantaneous recognition, thereby improving robustness against activity transitions. This approach not only broadens the effective training dataset but also offers promising avenues for enhancing HAR systems in complex, real-world scenarios.",

    "summary": "Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to identify the direction of the attended speaker in multi-speaker environments from brain signals, such as Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, existing EEG-based AAD methods overlook the spatio-temporal dependencies of EEG signals, limiting their decoding and generalization abilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network (ListenNet) for AAD. The ListenNet has three key components: Spatio-temporal Dependency Encoder (STDE), Multi-scale Temporal Enhancement (MSTE), and Cross-Nested Attention (CNA). The STDE reconstructs dependencies between consecutive time windows across channels, improving the robustness of dynamic pattern extraction. The MSTE captures temporal features at multiple scales to represent both fine-grained and long-range temporal patterns. In addition, the CNA integrates hierarchical features more effectively through novel dynamic attention mechanisms to capture deep spatio-temporal correlations. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of ListenNet over state-of-the-art methods in both subject-dependent and challenging subject-independent settings, while reducing the trainable parameter count by approximately 7 times.

    "summary": "Material heritage typically has a whole set of associated immaterial heritage, which is essential to pass on to the visitor as a cultural mission of the destinations and those who manage them. In this sense, the interpretation of material heritage is a complex process that is not a fully efficient process with the mere observation of physical artifacts. In this context, it emerges as fundamental to provide visitors with a set of tools that allow them to correctly interpret the artifacts that come to fully understand the cultural dimension of the destinations and their heritage. Accordingly, the role of virtual reality can leverage the creation of innovative and immersive solutions that allow the visitor to understand and feel part of their own heritage and its ancestral component that defines the sociocultural roots of destinations and their civilizational traditions. This article, after dissecting and substantiating the role of virtual reality in the interpretation of heritage, presents a conceptual model, based on the use of virtual reality, which was, in part, prototyped in the scenario of the Portuguese Museum in the city of Miranda do Douro. This proposal is an ongoing contribution to the creation of innovative and immersive tools for the interpretation of heritage.",

However, there is a surprising lack of knowledge about how social factors such as emotions affect the process of explanation by a decision support system (DSS). While previous research has shown effects of emotions on DSS supported decision-making, it remains unknown in how far emotions affect cognitive processing during an explanation. In this study, we, therefore, investigated the influence of prior emotions and task-related arousal on the retention and understanding of explained feature relevance. To investigate the influence of prior emotions, we induced happiness and fear prior to the decision support interaction. Before emotion induction, user characteristics to assess their risk type were collected via a questionnaire. To identify emotional reactions to the explanations of the relevance of different features, we observed heart rate variability (HRV), facial expressions, and self-reported emotions of the explainee while observing and listening to the explanation and assessed their retention of the features as well as their influence on the outcome of the decision task. Results indicate that (1) task-unrelated prior emotions do not affected the ratantion but may affect the understanding of the relevance of certain features in the sense of an emotion-induced confirmation bias, (2) certain features related to personal attitudes yielded arousal in individual participants, (3) this arousal affected the understanding of these variables.",

In response, researchers and practitioners have developed tools to detect and reduce undesired bias, commonly referred to as fairness tools.

While the growing availability of such tools is promising, little is known about the broader landscape beyond well-known examples like AI Fairness 360 and Fairlearn. Because fairness is an ongoing concern, these tools must be built for long-term sustainability. Using an existing set of fairness tools as a reference, we systematically searched GitHub and identified 50 related projects. We then analyzed various aspects of their repositories to assess community engagement and the extent of ongoing maintenance. Our findings show diverse forms of engagement with these tools, suggesting strong support for open-source development. However, we also found significant variation in how well these tools are maintained. Notably, 53 percent of fairness projects become inactive within the first three years. By examining sustainability in fairness tooling, we aim to promote more stability and growth in this critical area.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate or automate human behavior in complex sequential decision-making tasks. A natural question is then whether LLMs exhibit similar decision-making behavior to humans, and can achieve comparable (or superior) performance. In this work, we focus on the exploration-exploitation (E&E) tradeoff, a fundamental aspect of dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. We employ canonical multi-armed bandit (MAB) tasks introduced in the cognitive science and psychiatry literature to conduct a comparative study of the E&E strategies of LLMs, humans, and MAB algorithms. We use interpretable choice models to capture the E&E strategies of the agents and investigate how explicit reasoning, through both prompting strategies and reasoning-enhanced models, shapes LLM decision-making. We find that reasoning shifts LLMs toward more human-like behavior, characterized by a mix of random and directed exploration. In simple stationary tasks, reasoning-enabled LLMs exhibit similar levels of random and directed exploration compared to humans. However, in more complex, non-stationary environments, LLMs struggle to match human adaptability, particularly in effective directed exploration, despite achieving similar regret in certain scenarios. Our findings highlight both the promise and limits of LLMs as simulators of human behavior and tools for automated decision-making and point to potential areas of improvements.",

    "summary": "Commonsense intelligence in machines is often assessed by static benchmarks that compare a model's output against human-prescribed correct labels. An important, albeit implicit, assumption of these labels is that they accurately capture what any human would think, effectively treating human common sense as homogeneous. However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary enormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident to one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a novel method for evaluating common sense in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically observed heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a model's judgment and that of a human population. We first find that, when treated as independent survey respondents, most LLMs remain below the human median in their individual commonsense competence. Second, when used as simulators of a hypothetical population, LLMs correlate with real humans only modestly in the extent to which they agree on the same set of statements. In both cases, smaller, open-weight models are surprisingly more competitive than larger, proprietary frontier models. Our evaluation framework, which ties commonsense intelligence to its cultural basis, contributes to the growing call for adapting AI models to human collectivities that possess different, often incompatible, social stocks of knowledge.",

    "summary": "Incorporating an autonomous auxiliary camera into robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) enhances spatial awareness and eliminates manual viewpoint control. Existing path planning methods for auxiliary cameras track two-dimensional surgical features but do not simultaneously account for camera orientation, workspace constraints, and robot joint limits. This study presents AutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve visualization in RAMIS. Implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, the system uses a priority-based, workspace-constrained control algorithm that combines heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained 99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\\pm$ 2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study (N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new multi-camera visualization methods in RAMIS.",

Using a Fictional Inquiry (FI) method set in the Harry Potter universe, this research reveals that young people desire social media that functions more like immersive, navigable shared social spaces. Across these interviews, participants identified six key priorities for meaningful social connection over social media: intuitive social navigation, shared collaborative experiences, communal environments fostering close relationships, flexible self-presentation, intentional engagement, and playful social mechanics. We introduce the \\textit{spatial integrity} framework, a set of four interrelated design principles: spatial presence, spatial composition, spatial configuration, and spatial depth. Together, these principles outline how online spaces can be designed to feel more like meaningful environments, spaces where relationships can grow through shared presence, movement, and intentional interaction. Participants also described the FI process itself as meaningful, not only for generating new ideas but for empowering them to imagine and shape the future of social media.",

    "summary": "Learning to solve a Rubik's Cube requires the learners to repeatedly practice a skill component, e.g., identifying a misplaced square and putting it back. However, for 3D physical tasks such as this, generating sufficient repeated practice opportunities for learners can be challenging, in part because it is difficult for novices to reconfigure the physical object to specific states. We propose Rubikon, an intelligent tutoring system for learning to solve the Rubik's Cube. Rubikon reduces the necessity for repeated manual configurations of the Rubik's Cube without compromising the tactile experience of handling a physical cube. The foundational design of Rubikon is an AR setup, where learners manipulate a physical cube while seeing an AR-rendered cube on a display. Rubikon automatically generates configurations of the Rubik's Cube to target learners' weaknesses and help them exercise diverse knowledge components. In a between-subjects experiment, we showed that Rubikon learners scored 25% higher on a post-test compared to baselines.",

It is reshaping traditional creative practices such as actor improvisation, which often struggles with predictable patterns, limited interaction, and a lack of engaging stimuli. In this paper, we introduce a new concept, Theatrical Language Processing (TLP), and an AI-driven creativity support tool, this http URL, designed to augment actors' creative expression and spontaneity through interactive practice. We conducted a user study involving tests and interviews with fourteen participants. Our findings indicate that: (1) Actors expanded their creativity when faced with AI-produced irregular scenarios; (2) The AI's unpredictability heightened their problem-solving skills, specifically in interpreting unfamiliar situations; (3) However, AI often generated excessively detailed scripts, which limited interpretive freedom and hindered subtext exploration.

Therefore, with the complementary power of the latest radiological AI foundation models and virtual reality (VR)'s intuitive data interaction, we propose SAMIRA, a novel conversational AI agent that assists users with localizing, segmenting, and visualizing 3D medical concepts in VR. Through speech-based interaction, the agent helps users understand radiological features, locate clinical targets, and generate segmentation masks that can be refined with just a few point prompts. The system also supports true-to-scale 3D visualization of segmented pathology to enhance patient-specific anatomical understanding. Furthermore, to determine the optimal interaction paradigm under near-far attention-switching for refining segmentation masks in an immersive, human-in-the-loop workflow, we compare VR controller pointing, head pointing, and eye tracking as input modes. With a user study, evaluations demonstrated a high usability score (SUS=90.0 $\\pm$ 9.0), low overall task load, as well as strong support for the proposed VR system's guidance, training potential, and integration of AI in radiological segmentation tasks.",

Building on a design workshop series and 15 interviews with small businesses, we introduce BizChat, a large language model (LLM)-powered web application that helps business owners across digital skills levels write their business plan -- an essential but often neglected document. To do so, BizChat's interface embodies three design considerations inspired by learning sciences: ensuring accessibility to users with less digital skills while maintaining extensibility to power users (\"low-floor-high-ceiling\"), providing in situ micro-learning to support entrepreneurial education (\"just-in-time learning\"), and framing interaction around business activities (\"contextualized technology introduction\").

    "summary": "Many online platforms incorporate engagement signals--such as likes and upvotes--into their content ranking systems and interface design. These signals are designed to boost user engagement. However, they can unintentionally elevate content that is less inclusive and may not support normatively desirable behavior. This issue becomes especially concerning when toxic content correlates strongly with popularity indicators such as likes and upvotes. In this study, we propose structured prosocial feedback as a complementary signal to likes and upvotes--one that highlights content quality based on normative criteria to help address the limitations of conventional engagement signals. We begin by designing and implementing a machine learning feedback system powered by a large language model (LLM), which evaluates user comments based on principles of positive psychology, such as individual well-being, constructive social media use, and character strengths. We then conduct a pre-registered user study to examine how existing peer-based and the new expert-based feedback interact to shape users' selection of comments in a social media setting. Results show that peer feedback increases conformity to popularity cues, while expert feedback shifts preferences toward normatively higher-quality content. Moreover, incorporating expert feedback alongside peer evaluations improves alignment with expert assessments and contributes to a less toxic community environment. This illustrates the added value of normative cues--such as expert scores generated by LLMs using psychological rubrics--and underscores the potential benefits of incorporating such signals into platform feedback systems to foster healthier online environments.",

    "summary": "This research focuses on how Large Language Models (LLMs) can help with (path) planning for mobile embodied agents such as robots, in a human-in-the-loop and interactive manner. A novel framework named LLM A*, aims to leverage the commonsense of LLMs, and the utility-optimal A* is proposed to facilitate few-shot near-optimal path planning. Prompts are used for two main purposes: 1) to provide LLMs with essential information like environments, costs, heuristics, etc.; 2) to communicate human feedback on intermediate planning results to LLMs. This approach takes human feedback on board and renders the entire planning process transparent (akin to a `white box') to humans. Moreover, it facilitates code-free path planning, thereby fostering the accessibility and inclusiveness of artificial intelligence techniques to communities less proficient in coding. Comparative analysis against A* and RL demonstrates that LLM A* exhibits greater efficiency in terms of search space and achieves paths comparable to A* while outperforming RL. The interactive nature of LLM A* also makes it a promising tool for deployment in collaborative human-robot tasks. Codes and Supplemental Materials can be found at GitHub: this https URL.",

This study categorizes such misalignments into three types: \\textbf{(1) Lack of functions to express intent}, \\textbf{(2) Inefficient action sequences}, and \\textbf{(3) Incorrect intentions that cannot solve the task}. To address these issues, we first formalize and define these three types of misalignments. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to detect these misalignments in O2ARC trajectories and conduct a hierarchical and quantitative analysis of their impact. Furthermore, we introduce an intention estimation algorithm that predicts missing alignment information between user actions and inferred intentions, leveraging our formalized framework. Through trajectory alignment, we experimentally demonstrate that AI models trained on human task-solving trajectories improve performance in mimicking human reasoning. Based on hierarchical analysis and experiments, we highlight the importance of trajectory-intention alignment and demonstrate the potential of intention learning.",

    "summary": "Low-dimensional visualizations, or \"projection maps,\" are widely used in scientific and creative domains to interpret large-scale and complex datasets. These visualizations not only aid in understanding existing knowledge spaces but also implicitly guide exploration into unknown areas. Although techniques such as t-SNE and UMAP can generate these maps, there exists no systematic method for leveraging them to generate new content. To address this, we introduce MapExplorer, a novel knowledge discovery task that translates coordinates within any projection map into coherent, contextually aligned textual content. This allows users to interactively explore and uncover insights embedded in the maps. To evaluate the performance of MapExplorer methods, we propose Atometric, a fine-grained metric inspired by ROUGE that quantifies logical coherence and alignment between generated and reference text. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate the versatility of MapExplorer in generating scientific hypotheses, crafting synthetic personas, and devising strategies for attacking large language models-even with simple baseline methods. By bridging visualization and generation, our work highlights the potential of MapExplorer to enable intuitive human-AI collaboration in large-scale data exploration.",

    "summary": "Natural language interaction with sensing systems is crucial for addressing users' personal concerns and providing health-related insights into their daily lives. When a user asks a question, the system automatically analyzes the full history of sensor data, extracts relevant information, and generates an appropriate response. However, existing systems are limited to short-duration (e.g., one minute) or low-frequency (e.g., daily step count) sensor data. In addition, they struggle with quantitative questions that require precise numerical answers. In this work, we introduce SensorChat, the first end-to-end QA system designed for daily life monitoring using long-duration, high-frequency time series data. Given raw sensor signals spanning multiple days and a user-defined natural language question, SensorChat generates semantically meaningful responses that directly address user concerns. SensorChat effectively handles both quantitative questions that require numerical precision and qualitative questions that require high-level reasoning to infer subjective insights. To achieve this, SensorChat uses an innovative three-stage pipeline including question decomposition, sensor data query, and answer assembly. The first and third stages leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret human queries and generate responses. The intermediate querying stage extracts relevant information from the complete sensor data history. Real-world implementation demonstrate SensorChat's capability for real-time interactions on a cloud server while also being able to run entirely on edge platforms after quantization. Comprehensive QA evaluations show that SensorChat achieves up to 93% higher answer accuracy than state-of-the-art systems on quantitative questions. Additionally, a user study with eight volunteers highlights SensorChat's effectiveness in answering qualitative and open-ended questions.",

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) introduces new opportunities for MRS by enabling semantic reasoning, in-context learning, and dynamic input handling.

This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent work at the intersection of LLMs and MRS, focusing on prompting strategies, fine-tuning methods, and data adaptation techniques. We propose a novel taxonomy to characterise integration patterns, identify transferable techniques from related recommendation domains, provide an overview of evaluation metrics and datasets, and point to possible future directions. We aim to clarify the emerging role of LLMs in multimodal recommendation and support future research in this rapidly evolving field.",

    "summary": "There are three fundamental asks from a ranking algorithm: it should scale to handle a large number of items, sort items accurately by their utility, and impose a total order on the items for logical consistency. But here's the catch-no algorithm can achieve all three at the same time. We call this limitation the SAT theorem for ranking algorithms. Given the dilemma, how can we design a practical system that meets user needs? Our current work at Airbnb provides an answer, with a working solution deployed at scale. We start with pairwise learning-to-rank (LTR) models-the bedrock of search ranking tech stacks today. They scale linearly with the number of items ranked and perform strongly on metrics like NDCG by learning from pairwise comparisons. They are at a sweet spot of performance vs. cost, making them an ideal choice for several industrial applications. However, they have a drawback-by ignoring interactions between items, they compromise on accuracy. To improve accuracy, we create a \"true\" pairwise LTR model-one that captures interactions between items during pairwise comparisons. But accuracy comes at the expense of scalability and total order, and we discuss strategies to counter these challenges. For greater accuracy, we take each item in the search result, and compare it against the rest of the items along two dimensions: (1) Superiority: How strongly do searchers prefer the given item over the remaining ones? (2) Similarity: How similar is the given item to all the other items? This forms the basis of our \"all-pairwise\" LTR framework, which factors in interactions across all items at once. Looking at items on the search result page all together-superiority and similarity combined-gives us a deeper understanding of what searchers truly want. We quantify the resulting improvements in searcher experience through offline and online experiments at Airbnb.",

    "summary": "Charts are crucial for data analysis and this http URL-to-chart retrieval systems have become increasingly important for Business Intelligence (BI), where users need to find relevant charts that match their analytical needs. These needs can be categorized into precise queries that are well-specified and fuzzy queries that are more exploratory -- both require understanding the semantics and context of the charts. However, existing text-to-chart retrieval solutions often fail to capture the semantic content and contextual information of charts, primarily due to the lack of comprehensive metadata (or semantic insights). To address this limitation, we propose a training data development pipeline that automatically synthesizes hierarchical semantic insights for charts, covering visual patterns (visual-oriented), statistical properties (statistics-oriented), and practical applications (task-oriented), which produces 207,498 semantic insights for 69,166 charts. Based on these, we train a CLIP-based model named ChartFinder to learn better representations of charts for text-to-chart retrieval. Our method leverages rich semantic insights during the training phase to develop a model that understands both visual and semantic aspects of this http URL evaluate text-to-chart retrieval performance, we curate the first benchmark, CRBench, for this task with 21,862 charts and 326 text queries from real-world BI applications, with ground-truth labels verified by the crowd this http URL show that ChartFinder significantly outperforms existing methods in text-to-chart retrieval tasks across various settings. For precise queries, ChartFinder achieves up to 66.9% NDCG@10, which is 11.58% higher than state-of-the-art models. In fuzzy query tasks, our method also demonstrates consistent improvements, with an average increase of 5% across nearly all metrics.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly central to recommendation scenarios due to their remarkable natural language understanding and generation capabilities. Although significant research has explored the use of LLMs for various recommendation tasks, little effort has been dedicated to verifying whether they have memorized public recommendation dataset as part of their training data. This is undesirable because memorization reduces the generalizability of research findings, as benchmarking on memorized datasets does not guarantee generalization to unseen datasets. Furthermore, memorization can amplify biases, for example, some popular items may be recommended more frequently than others.\nIn this work, we investigate whether LLMs have memorized public recommendation datasets. Specifically, we examine two model families (GPT and Llama) across multiple sizes, focusing on one of the most widely used dataset in recommender systems: MovieLens-1M. First, we define dataset memorization as the extent to which item attributes, user profiles, and user-item interactions can be retrieved by prompting the LLMs. Second, we analyze the impact of memorization on recommendation performance. Lastly, we examine whether memorization varies across model families and model sizes. Our results reveal that all models exhibit some degree of memorization of MovieLens-1M, and that recommendation performance is related to the extent of memorization. We have made all the code publicly available at: this https URL",

    "summary": "Due to the increasing trend of performing spamming activities (e.g., Web spam, deceptive reviews, fake followers, etc.) on various online platforms to gain undeserved benefits, spam detection has emerged as a hot research issue. Previous attempts to combat spam mainly employ features related to metadata, user behaviors, or relational ties. These studies have made considerable progress in understanding and filtering spamming campaigns. However, this problem remains far from fully solved. Almost all the proposed features focus on a limited number of observed attributes or explainable phenomena, making it difficult for existing methods to achieve further improvement. To broaden the vision about solving the spam problem and address long-standing challenges (class imbalance and graph incompleteness) in the spam detection area, we propose a new attempt of utilizing signed latent factors to filter fraudulent activities. The spam-contaminated relational datasets of multiple online applications in this scenario are interpreted by the unified signed network. Two competitive and highly dissimilar algorithms of latent factors mining (LFM) models are designed based on multi-relational likelihoods estimation (LFM-MRLE) and signed pairwise ranking (LFM-SPR), respectively. We then explore how to apply the mined latent factors to spam detection tasks. Experiments on real-world datasets of different kinds of Web applications (social media and Web forum) indicate that LFM models outperform state-of-the-art baselines in detecting spamming activities. By specifically manipulating experimental data, the effectiveness of our methods in dealing with incomplete and imbalanced challenges is validated.",

To reduce the memory required for building the database and maintain accuracy simultaneously, we proposed a new approach integrating a streaming algorithm with k-means clustering into RAG. Our approach applied a streaming algorithm to update the index dynamically and reduce memory consumption. Additionally, the k-means algorithm clusters highly similar documents, and the query time would be shortened.

    "summary": "Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to improve recommendation accuracy in sparse domains by transferring knowledge from data-rich domains. However, existing CDR approaches often assume that user-item interaction data across domains is publicly available, neglecting user privacy concerns. Additionally, they experience performance degradation with sparse overlapping users due to their reliance on a large number of fully shared users for knowledge transfer. To address these challenges, we propose a Federated Prototype-based Contrastive Learning (CL) framework for Privacy Preserving CDR, called FedPCL-CDR. This approach utilizes non-overlapping user information and differential prototypes to improve model performance within a federated learning framework. FedPCL-CDR comprises two key modules: local domain (client) learning and global server aggregation. In the local domain, FedPCL-CDR first clusters all user data and utilizes local differential privacy (LDP) to learn differential prototypes, effectively utilizing non-overlapping user information and protecting user privacy. It then conducts knowledge transfer by employing both local and global prototypes returned from the server in a CL manner. Meanwhile, the global server aggregates differential prototypes sent from local domains to learn both local and global prototypes. Extensive experiments on four CDR tasks across Amazon and Douban datasets demonstrate that FedPCL-CDR surpasses SOTA baselines. We release our code at this https URL CDR",

Our straightforward, autoencoder-based method produces a closed-form solution that leverages rich content signals for cold items while refining user representations in data-sparse environments. Importantly, our method strikes a balance by effectively recommending cold start items and handling cold start users without incurring extra bias, and it maintains strong performance in warm settings. Experimental results demonstrate improved recommendation accuracy and robustness compared to previous collaborative filtering approaches. Moreover, our model serves as a strong baseline for future comparative studies.",

    "summary": "Multi-objective learning endeavors to concurrently optimize multiple objectives using a single model, aiming to achieve high and balanced performance across diverse objectives. However, this often entails a more complex optimization problem, particularly when navigating potential conflicts between objectives, leading to solutions with higher memory requirements and computational complexity. This paper introduces a Multi-Objective Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning (MOGCSL) framework for automatically learning to achieve multiple objectives from offline sequential data. MOGCSL extends the conventional GCSL method to multi-objective scenarios by redefining goals from one-dimensional scalars to multi-dimensional vectors. It benefits from naturally eliminating the need for complex architectures and optimization constraints. Moreover, MOGCSL effectively filters out uninformative or noisy instances that fail to achieve desirable long-term rewards across multiple objectives. We also introduces a novel goal-selection algorithm for MOGCSL to model and identify \"high\" achievable goals for inference.\nWhile MOGCSL is quite general, we focus on its application to the next action prediction problem in commercial-grade recommender systems. In this context, any viable solution needs to be reasonably scalable and also be robust to large amounts of noisy data that is characteristic of this application space. We show that MOGCSL performs admirably on both counts by extensive experiments on real-world recommendation datasets. Also, analysis and experiments are included to explain its strength in discounting the noisier portions of training data in recommender systems with multiple objectives.",

Existing studies have explored various fusion paradigms and consistency constraints to improve the alignment of equivalent entities, while overlooking that the visual modality may not always contribute positively. Empirically, entities with low-similarity images usually generate unsatisfactory performance, highlighting the limitation of overly relying on visual features. We believe the model can be biased toward the visual modality, leading to a shortcut image-matching task. To address this, we propose a counterfactual debiasing framework for MMEA, termed CDMEA, which investigates visual modality bias from a causal perspective. Our approach aims to leverage both visual and graph modalities to enhance MMEA while suppressing the direct causal effect of the visual modality on model predictions. By estimating the Total Effect (TE) of both modalities and excluding the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of the visual modality, we ensure that the model predicts based on the Total Indirect Effect (TIE), effectively utilizing both modalities and reducing visual modality bias. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets show that CDMEA outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods, especially in low-similarity, high-noise, and low-resource data scenarios.",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework which is referred to as joint source-channel noise adding with adaptive denoising (JSCNA-AD) for SemCom based on a diffusion model (DM). Unlike conventional encoder-decoder designs, our approach intentionally incorporates the channel noise during transmission, effectively transforming the harmful channel noise into a constructive component of the diffusion-based semantic reconstruction process. Besides, we introduce an attention-based adaptive denoising mechanism, in which transmitted images are divided into multiple regions, and the number of denoising steps is dynamically allocated based on the semantic importance of each region. This design effectively balances the reception quality and the inference latency by prioritizing the critical semantic information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing SemCom schemes under various noise conditions, underscoring the potential of diffusion-based models in next-generation communication systems.",

    "summary": "To circumvent the high path loss of mmWave propagation and reduce the hardware cost of massive multiple-input multiple-output antenna systems, full-dimensional hybrid beamforming is critical in 5G and beyond wireless communications. Concerning an uplink multi-cell system with a large-scale uniform planar antenna array, this paper designs an efficient hybrid beamformer using primitive Kronecker decomposition and dynamic factor allocation, where the analog beamformer applies to null the inter-cell interference and simultaneously enhances the desired signals. In contrast, the digital beamformer mitigates the intra-cell interference using the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. Then, due to the low accuracy of phase shifters inherent in the analog beamformer, a low-complexity hybrid beamformer is developed to slow its adjustment speed. Next, an optimality analysis from a subspace perspective is performed, and a sufficient condition for optimal antenna configuration is established. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the achievable sum rate of the proposed beamformer approaches that of the optimal pure digital MMSE scheme, yet with much lower computational complexity and hardware cost.",

Either OSD or the $A^*$ decoding utilizes the magnitudes of the received symbols to establish the most reliable and independent positions (MRIP) frame. A restricted searched space can be employed to achieve near-optimum decoding with reduced decoding complexity. For a low-rate code with large minimum distance, the restricted search space is still very huge.\nWe propose to use concatenated coding to further restrict the search space by proposing an improved MRIP frame. The improved MRIP frame is founded according to magnitudes of log likelihood ratios (LLRs) obtained by the soft-in soft-out (SISO) decoder for the inner code.\nWe focus on the construction and decoding of several $(n,k)$ = (128,36) binary linear block codes based on concatenated coding. We use the (128,36) extended BCH (eBCH) code as a benchmark for comparison. Simulation shows that there exist constructed concatenated codes which are much more efficient than the (128,36) eBCH code. Some other codes of length 128 or close to 128 are also constructed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.",

    "summary": "We propose a new method for retrieving the algebraic structure of a generic alternant code given an arbitrary generator matrix, provided certain conditions are met. We then discuss how this challenges the security of the McEliece cryptosystem instantiated with this family of codes. The central object of our work is the quadratic hull related to a linear code, defined as the intersection of all quadrics passing through the columns of a given generator or parity-check matrix, where the columns are considered as points in the affine or projective space. The geometric properties of this object reveal important information about the internal algebraic structure of the code. This is particularly evident in the case of generalized Reed-Solomon codes, whose quadratic hull is deeply linked to a well-known algebraic variety called the rational normal curve. By utilizing the concept of Weil restriction of affine varieties, we demonstrate that the quadratic hull of a generic dual alternant code inherits many interesting features from the rational normal curve, on account of the fact that alternant codes are subfield-subcodes of generalized Reed-Solomon codes. If the rate of the generic alternant code is sufficiently high, this allows us to construct a polynomial-time algorithm for retrieving the underlying generalized Reed-Solomon code from which the alternant code is defined, which leads to an efficient key-recovery attack against the McEliece cryptosystem when instantiated with this class of codes. Finally, we discuss the generalization of this approach to Algebraic-Geometry codes and Goppa codes.",

    "summary": "Traditional entropy-based methods - such as cross-entropy loss in classification problems - have long been essential tools for quantifying uncertainty and disorder in data and developing artificial intelligence algorithms. However, the rapid growth of data across various domains has introduced new challenges, particularly the integration of heterogeneous datasets with intrinsic disparities. In this paper, we extend zentropy theory into the data science domain by introducing intrinsic entropy, enabling more effective learning from heterogeneous data sources. We propose a zentropy-enhanced neural network (ZENN) that simultaneously learns both energy and intrinsic entropy components, capturing the underlying structure of multi-source data. To support this, we redesign the neural network architecture to better reflect the intrinsic properties and variability inherent in diverse datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ZENN on classification tasks and energy landscape reconstructions, showing its superior generalization capabilities and robustness-particularly in predicting high-order derivatives. As a practical application, we employ ZENN to reconstruct the Helmholtz energy landscape of Fe3Pt using data generated from DFT and capture key material behaviors, including negative thermal expansion and the critical point in the temperature-pressure space. Overall, our study introduces a novel approach for data-driven machine learning grounded in zentropy theory, highlighting ZENN as a versatile and robust deep learning framework for scientific problems involving complex, heterogeneous datasets.",

    "summary": "The selection of hyperparameters, such as prompt templates in large language models (LLMs), must often strike a balance between reliability and cost. In many cases, structural relationships between the expected reliability levels of the hyperparameters can be inferred from prior information and held-out data -- e.g., longer prompt templates may be more detailed and thus more reliable. However, existing hyperparameter selection methods either do not provide formal reliability guarantees or are unable to incorporate structured knowledge in the hyperparameter space. This paper introduces reliability graph-based Pareto testing (RG-PT), a novel multi-objective hyperparameter selection framework that maintains formal reliability guarantees in terms of false discovery rate (FDR), while accounting for known relationships among hyperparameters via a directed acyclic graph. Edges in the graph reflect expected reliability and cost trade-offs among hyperparameters, which are inferred via the Bradley-Terry (BT) ranking model from prior information and held-out data. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that RG-PT significantly outperforms existing methods such as learn-then-test (LTT) and Pareto testing (PT) through a more efficient exploration of the hyperparameter space.",

    "summary": "This work presents a joint design of encoding and encryption procedures for public key encryptions (PKEs) and key encapsulation mechanism (KEMs) such as Kyber, without relying on the assumption of independent decoding noise components, achieving reductions in both communication overhead (CER) and decryption failure rate (DFR). Our design features two techniques: ciphertext packing and lattice packing. First, we extend the Peikert-Vaikuntanathan-Waters (PVW) method to Kyber: $\\ell$ plaintexts are packed into a single ciphertext. This scheme is referred to as P$_\\ell$-Kyber. We prove that the P$_\\ell$-Kyber is IND-CCA secure under the M-LWE hardness assumption. We show that the decryption decoding noise entries across the $\\ell$ plaintexts (also known as layers) are mutually independent. Second, we propose a cross-layer lattice encoding scheme for the P$_\\ell$-Kyber, where every $\\ell$ cross-layer information symbols are encoded to a lattice point. This way we obtain a \\emph{coded} P$_\\ell$-Kyber, where the decoding noise entries for each lattice point are mutually independent. Therefore, the DFR analysis does not require the assumption of independence among the decryption decoding noise entries. Both DFR and CER are greatly decreased thanks to ciphertext packing and lattice packing. We demonstrate that with $\\ell=24$ and Leech lattice encoder, the proposed coded P$_\\ell$-KYBER1024 achieves DFR $<2^{-281}$ and CER $ = 4.6$, i.e., a decrease of CER by $90\\%$ compared to KYBER1024.",

    "summary": "Spiking Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as an energy-efficient alternative to conventional LLMs through their event-driven computation. To effectively obtain spiking LLMs, researchers develop different ANN-to-SNN conversion methods by leveraging pre-trained ANN parameters while inheriting the energy efficiency of SNN. However, existing conversion methods struggle with extreme activation outliers and incompatible nonlinear operations of ANN-based LLMs. To address this, we propose a loss-less ANN-SNN conversion for fully spike-driven LLMs, termed LAS. Specifically, LAS introduces two novel neurons to convert the activation outlier and nonlinear operation of ANN-based LLMs. Moreover, LAS tailors the spike-equivalent Transformer components for spiking LLMs, which can ensure full spiking conversion without any loss of performance. Experimental results on six language models and two vision-language models demonstrate that LAS achieves loss-less conversion. Notably, on OPT-66B, LAS even improves the accuracy of 2\\% on the WSC task. In addition, the parameter and ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of LAS.

    "summary": "Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) is a promising compute paradigm to improve speed and power efficiency of neural network inference beyond the limits of conventional von Neumann-based architectures. However, AIMC introduces fundamental challenges such as noisy computations and strict constraints on input and output quantization. Because of these constraints and imprecisions, off-the-shelf LLMs are not able to achieve 4-bit-level performance when deployed on AIMC-based hardware. While researchers previously investigated recovering this accuracy gap on small, mostly vision-based models, a generic method applicable to LLMs pre-trained on trillions of tokens does not yet exist. In this work, we introduce a general and scalable method to robustly adapt LLMs for execution on noisy, low-precision analog hardware. Our approach enables state-of-the-art models $\\unicode{x2013}$ including Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct $\\unicode{x2013}$ to retain performance comparable to 4-bit weight, 8-bit activation baselines, despite the presence of analog noise and quantization constraints. Additionally, we show that as a byproduct of our training methodology, analog foundation models can be quantized for inference on low-precision digital hardware. Finally, we show that our models also benefit from test-time compute scaling, showing better scaling behavior than models trained with 4-bit weight and 8-bit static input quantization. Our work bridges the gap between high-capacity LLMs and efficient analog hardware, offering a path toward energy-efficient foundation models. Code is available at this https URL .",

    "summary": "Graph unlearning is a crucial approach for protecting user privacy by erasing the influence of user data on trained graph models. Recent developments in graph unlearning methods have primarily focused on maintaining model prediction performance while removing user information. However, we have observed that when user information is deleted from the model, the prediction distribution across different sensitive groups often changes. Furthermore, graph models are shown to be prone to amplifying biases, making the study of fairness in graph unlearning particularly important. This raises the question: Does graph unlearning actually introduce bias? Our findings indicate that the predictions of post-unlearning models become highly correlated with sensitive attributes, confirming the introduction of bias in the graph unlearning process. To address this issue, we propose a fair graph unlearning method, FGU. To guarantee privacy, FGU trains shard models on partitioned subgraphs, unlearns the requested data from the corresponding subgraphs, and retrains the shard models on the modified subgraphs. To ensure fairness, FGU employs a bi-level debiasing process: it first enables shard-level fairness by incorporating a fairness regularizer in the shard model retraining, and then achieves global-level fairness by aligning all shard models to minimize global disparity. Our experiments demonstrate that FGU achieves superior fairness while maintaining privacy and accuracy. Additionally, FGU is robust to diverse unlearning requests, ensuring fairness and utility performance across various data distributions.",

This study examines the energy consumed during the FL process, focusing on three main energy-intensive processes: pre-processing, communication, and local learning, all contributing to the overall energy footprint. We rely on the observation that device/client selection is crucial for speeding up the convergence of model training in a distributed AIoT setting and propose two clustering-informed methods. These clustering solutions are designed to group AIoT devices with similar label distributions, resulting in clusters composed of nearly heterogeneous devices. Hence, our methods alleviate the heterogeneity often encountered in real-world distributed learning applications. Throughout extensive numerical experimentation, we demonstrate that our clustering strategies typically achieve high convergence rates while maintaining low energy consumption when compared to other recent approaches available in the literature.",

    "summary": "We investigate deep morphological neural networks (DMNNs). We demonstrate that despite their inherent non-linearity, activations between layers are essential for DMNNs. We then propose several new architectures for DMNNs, each with a different constraint on their parameters. For the first (resp. second) architecture, we work under the constraint that the majority of parameters (resp. learnable parameters) should be part of morphological operations. We empirically show that our proposed networks can be successfully trained, and are more prunable than linear networks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully train DMNNs under such constraints, although the generalization capabilities of our networks remain limited. Finally, we propose a hybrid network architecture combining linear and morphological layers, showing empirically that the inclusion of morphological layers significantly accelerates the convergence of gradient descent with large batches.",

    "summary": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation is considered a hallmark of human and animal intelligence. To achieve OOD through composition, a system must discover the environment-invariant properties of experienced input-output mappings and transfer them to novel inputs. This can be realised if an intelligent system can identify appropriate, task-invariant, and composable input features, as well as the composition methods, thus allowing it to act based not on the interpolation between learnt data points but on the task-invariant composition of those features. We propose that in order to confirm that an algorithm does indeed learn compositional structures from data, it is not enough to just test on an OOD setup, but one also needs to confirm that the features identified are indeed compositional. We showcase this by exploring two tasks with clearly defined OOD metrics that are not OOD solvable by three commonly used neural networks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Transformer. In addition, we develop two novel network architectures imbued with biases that allow them to be successful in OOD scenarios. We show that even with correct biases and almost perfect OOD performance, an algorithm can still fail to learn the correct features for compositional generalisation.",

    "summary": "Federated learning (FL) presents an effective solution for collaborative model training while maintaining data privacy across decentralized client datasets. However, data quality issues such as noisy labels, missing classes, and imbalanced distributions significantly challenge its effectiveness. This study proposes a federated learning methodology that systematically addresses data quality issues, including noise, class imbalance, and missing labels. The proposed approach systematically enhances data integrity through adaptive noise cleaning, collaborative conditional GAN-based synthetic data generation, and robust federated model training. Experimental evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets (MNIST and Fashion-MNIST) demonstrate significant improvements in federated model performance, particularly macro-F1 Score, under varying noise and class imbalance conditions. Additionally, the proposed framework carefully balances computational feasibility and substantial performance gains, ensuring practicality for resource constrained edge devices while rigorously maintaining data privacy. Our results indicate that this method effectively mitigates common data quality challenges, providing a robust, scalable, and privacy compliant solution suitable for diverse real-world federated learning scenarios.",

Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard, the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively \"opening\" the black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.",

    "summary": "We propose a new framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the agents cooperate in a time-evolving network with latent community structures and mixed memberships. Unlike traditional neighbor-based or fixed interaction graphs, our community-based framework captures flexible and abstract coordination patterns by allowing each agent to belong to multiple overlapping communities. Each community maintains shared policy and value functions, which are aggregated by individual agents according to personalized membership weights. We also design actor-critic algorithms that exploit this structure: agents inherit community-level estimates for policy updates and value learning, enabling structured information sharing without requiring access to other agents' policies. Importantly, our approach supports both transfer learning by adapting to new agents or tasks via membership estimation, and active learning by prioritizing uncertain communities during exploration. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees under linear function approximation for both actor and critic updates. To our knowledge, this is the first MARL framework that integrates community structure, transferability, and active learning with provable guarantees.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in generative models have made it increasingly difficult to distinguish real data from model-generated synthetic data. Using synthetic data for successive training of future model generations creates \"self-consuming loops\", which may lead to model collapse or training instability. Furthermore, synthetic data is often subject to human feedback and curated by users based on their preferences. Ferbach et al. (2024) recently showed that when data is curated according to user preferences, the self-consuming retraining loop drives the model to converge toward a distribution that optimizes those preferences. However, in practice, data curation is often noisy or adversarially manipulated. For example, competing platforms may recruit malicious users to adversarially curate data and disrupt rival models. In this paper, we study how generative models evolve under self-consuming retraining loops with noisy and adversarially curated data. We theoretically analyze the impact of such noisy data curation on generative models and identify conditions for the robustness of the retraining process. Building on this analysis, we design attack algorithms for competitive adversarial scenarios, where a platform with a limited budget employs malicious users to misalign a rival's model from actual user preferences. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

We employ short, Bayesian optimization sessions that leverage multi-fidelity, hyperparameter space pruning, progressive halving, and a degree of human guidance. We utilize the Optuna TPE sampler and Hyperband pruner, as well as the Scikit-Learn Gaussian process minimization. Initially, we use efficient low-fidelity sprints to prune the hyperparameter space. Subsequent sprints progressively increase their model fidelity and employ hyperband pruning for efficiency. A second aspect of our approach is using a meta-learner to tune threshold values to resolve classification probabilities during inference. We demonstrate our method on a collection of variants of the 2021 Joint Entity and Relation Extraction model proposed by Eberts and Ulges.",

    "summary": "During the training of Large Language Models (LLMs), tensor data is periodically \"checkpointed\" to persistent storage to allow recovery of work done in the event of failure. The volume of data that must be copied during each checkpoint, even when using reduced-precision representations such as bfloat16, often reaches hundreds of gigabytes. Furthermore, the data must be moved across a network and written to a storage system before the next epoch occurs. With a view to ultimately building an optimized checkpointing solution, this paper presents experimental analysis of checkpoint data used to derive a design that maximizes the use of lossless compression to reduce the volume of data. We examine how tensor data and its compressibility evolve during model training and evaluate the efficacy of existing common off-the-shelf general purpose compression engines combined with known data optimization techniques such as byte-grouping and incremental delta compression.\nLeveraging our analysis we have built an effective compression solution, known as Language Model Compressor (LMC), which is based on byte-grouping and Huffman encoding. LMC offers more compression performance than the best alternative (BZ2) but with an order-of-magnitude reduction in the time needed to perform the compression. We show that a 16-core parallel implementation of LMC can attain compression and decompression throughput of 2.78 GiB/s and 3.76 GiB/s respectively. This increase in performance ultimately reduces the CPU resources needed and provides more time to copy the data to the storage system before the next epoch thus allowing for higher-frequency checkpoints.",

Our results demonstrate that while these models achieve high accuracy, sensitivity remains a limiting factor for real-world clinical applications. In addition, we identify the most influential predictive features and propose strategies to improve machine learning-based stroke prediction.

    "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used, understanding them systematically is key to improving their safety and realizing their full potential. Although many models are aligned using techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), they are still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. Some of the existing adversarial attack methods search for discrete tokens that may jailbreak a target model while others try to optimize the continuous space represented by the tokens of the model's vocabulary. While techniques based on the discrete space may prove to be inefficient, optimization of continuous token embeddings requires projections to produce discrete tokens, which might render them ineffective. To fully utilize the constraints and the structures of the space, we develop an intrinsic optimization technique using exponentiated gradient descent with the Bregman projection method to ensure that the optimized one-hot encoding always stays within the probability simplex. We prove the convergence of the technique and implement an efficient algorithm that is effective in jailbreaking several widely used LLMs. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique using five open-source LLMs on four openly available datasets. The results show that the technique achieves a higher success rate with great efficiency compared to three other state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques.

    "summary": "Graph learning, or network inference, is a prominent problem in graph signal processing (GSP). GSP generalizes the Fourier transform to non-Euclidean domains, and graph learning is pivotal to applying GSP when these domains are unknown. With the recent prevalence of multi-way data, there has been growing interest in product graphs that naturally factorize dependencies across different ways. However, the types of graph products that can be learned are still limited for modeling diverse dependency structures. In this paper, we study the problem of learning a Kronecker-structured product graph from smooth signals. Unlike the more commonly used Cartesian product, the Kronecker product models dependencies in a more intricate, non-separable way, but posits harder constraints on the graph learning problem. To tackle this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating scheme to optimize each factor graph and provide theoretical guarantees for its asymptotic convergence. The proposed algorithm is also modified to learn factor graphs of the strong product. We conduct experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs and demonstrate our approach's efficacy and superior performance compared to existing methods.",

    "summary": "Traditional entropy-based methods - such as cross-entropy loss in classification problems - have long been essential tools for quantifying uncertainty and disorder in data and developing artificial intelligence algorithms. However, the rapid growth of data across various domains has introduced new challenges, particularly the integration of heterogeneous datasets with intrinsic disparities. In this paper, we extend zentropy theory into the data science domain by introducing intrinsic entropy, enabling more effective learning from heterogeneous data sources. We propose a zentropy-enhanced neural network (ZENN) that simultaneously learns both energy and intrinsic entropy components, capturing the underlying structure of multi-source data. To support this, we redesign the neural network architecture to better reflect the intrinsic properties and variability inherent in diverse datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ZENN on classification tasks and energy landscape reconstructions, showing its superior generalization capabilities and robustness-particularly in predicting high-order derivatives. As a practical application, we employ ZENN to reconstruct the Helmholtz energy landscape of Fe3Pt using data generated from DFT and capture key material behaviors, including negative thermal expansion and the critical point in the temperature-pressure space. Overall, our study introduces a novel approach for data-driven machine learning grounded in zentropy theory, highlighting ZENN as a versatile and robust deep learning framework for scientific problems involving complex, heterogeneous datasets.",

    "summary": "As demand for intelligent services rises and edge devices become more capable, distributed learning at the network edge has emerged as a key enabling technology. While existing paradigms like federated learning (FL) and decentralized FL (DFL) enable privacy-preserving distributed learning in many scenarios, they face potential challenges in connectivity and synchronization imposed by resource-constrained and infrastructure-less environments. While more robust, gossip learning (GL) algorithms have generally been designed for homogeneous data distributions and may not suit all contexts. This paper introduces Chisme, a novel suite of protocols designed to address the challenges of implementing robust intelligence in the network edge, characterized by heterogeneous data distributions, episodic connectivity, and lack of infrastructure. Chisme includes both synchronous DFL (Chisme-DFL) and asynchronous GL (Chisme-GL) variants that enable collaborative yet decentralized model training that considers underlying data heterogeneity. We introduce a data similarity heuristic that allows agents to opportunistically infer affinity with each other using the existing communication of model updates in decentralized FL and GL. We leverage the heuristic to extend DFL's model aggregation and GL's model merge mechanisms for better personalized training while maintaining collaboration. While Chisme-DFL is a synchronous decentralized approach whose resource utilization scales linearly with network size, Chisme-GL is fully asynchronous and has a lower, constant resource requirement independent of network size. We demonstrate that Chisme methods outperform their standard counterparts in model training over distributed and heterogeneous data in network scenarios ranging from less connected and reliable networks to fully connected and lossless networks.",

    "summary": "Transformer models learn in two distinct modes: in-weights learning (IWL), encoding knowledge into model weights, and in-context learning (ICL), adapting flexibly to context without weight modification. To better understand the interplay between these learning modes, we draw inspiration from evolutionary biology's analogous adaptive strategies: genetic encoding (akin to IWL, adapting over generations and fixed within an individual's lifetime) and phenotypic plasticity (akin to ICL, enabling flexible behavioral responses to environmental cues). In evolutionary biology, environmental predictability dictates the balance between these strategies: stability favors genetic encoding, while reliable predictive cues promote phenotypic plasticity. We experimentally operationalize these dimensions of predictability and systematically investigate their influence on the ICL/IWL balance in Transformers. Using regression and classification tasks, we show that high environmental stability decisively favors IWL, as predicted, with a sharp transition at maximal stability. Conversely, high cue reliability enhances ICL efficacy, particularly when stability is low. Furthermore, learning dynamics reveal task-contingent temporal evolution: while a canonical ICL-to-IWL shift occurs in some settings (e.g., classification with many classes), we demonstrate that scenarios with easier IWL (e.g., fewer classes) or slower ICL acquisition (e.g., regression) can exhibit an initial IWL phase later yielding to ICL dominance. These findings support a relative-cost hypothesis for explaining these learning mode transitions, establishing predictability as a critical factor governing adaptive strategies in Transformers, and offering novel insights for understanding ICL and guiding training methodologies.",

    "summary": "Over the past decade, the use of machine learning has increased exponentially. Models are far more complex than ever before, growing to gargantuan sizes and housing millions of weights. Unfortunately, the fact that large models have become the state of the art means that it often costs millions of dollars to train and operate them. These expenses not only hurt companies but also bar non-wealthy individuals from contributing to new developments and force consumers to pay greater prices for AI. Current methods used to prune models, such as iterative magnitude pruning, have shown great accuracy but require an iterative training sequence that is incredibly computationally and environmentally taxing. To solve this problem, BINGO is introduced. BINGO, during the training pass, studies specific subsets of a neural network one at a time to gauge how significant of a role each weight plays in contributing to a network's accuracy. By the time training is done, BINGO generates a significance score for each weight, allowing for insignificant weights to be pruned in one shot. BINGO provides an accuracy-preserving pruning technique that is less computationally intensive than current methods, allowing for a world where AI growth does not have to mean model growth, as well.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate or automate human behavior in complex sequential decision-making tasks. A natural question is then whether LLMs exhibit similar decision-making behavior to humans, and can achieve comparable (or superior) performance. In this work, we focus on the exploration-exploitation (E&E) tradeoff, a fundamental aspect of dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. We employ canonical multi-armed bandit (MAB) tasks introduced in the cognitive science and psychiatry literature to conduct a comparative study of the E&E strategies of LLMs, humans, and MAB algorithms. We use interpretable choice models to capture the E&E strategies of the agents and investigate how explicit reasoning, through both prompting strategies and reasoning-enhanced models, shapes LLM decision-making. We find that reasoning shifts LLMs toward more human-like behavior, characterized by a mix of random and directed exploration. In simple stationary tasks, reasoning-enabled LLMs exhibit similar levels of random and directed exploration compared to humans. However, in more complex, non-stationary environments, LLMs struggle to match human adaptability, particularly in effective directed exploration, despite achieving similar regret in certain scenarios. Our findings highlight both the promise and limits of LLMs as simulators of human behavior and tools for automated decision-making and point to potential areas of improvements.",

    "summary": "With the growing demand for healthy foods, agricultural product price forecasting has become increasingly important. Hass avocados, as a high-value crop, exhibit complex price fluctuations influenced by factors such as seasonality, region, and weather. Traditional prediction models often struggle with highly nonlinear and dynamic data. To address this, we propose a hybrid deep learning model, TCN-MLP-Attention Architecture, combining Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) for sequential feature extraction, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for nonlinear interactions, and an Attention mechanism for dynamic feature weighting. The dataset used covers over 50,000 records of Hass avocado sales across the U.S. from 2015 to 2018, including variables such as sales volume, average price, time, region, weather, and variety type, collected from point-of-sale systems and the Hass Avocado Board. After systematic preprocessing, including missing value imputation and feature normalization, the proposed model was trained and evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate that the TCN-MLP-Attention model achieves excellent predictive performance, with an RMSE of 1.23 and an MSE of 1.51, outperforming traditional methods. This research provides a scalable and effective approach for time series forecasting in agricultural markets and offers valuable insights for intelligent supply chain management and price strategy optimization.",

Instead of explicitly utilizing the structure of special manifolds as studied in previous works, we investigate direct sampling of the Euclidean diffusion models for general manifold-constrained data in this paper. We reveal the multiscale singularity of the score function in the embedded space of manifold, which hinders the accuracy of diffusion-generated samples. We then present an elaborate theoretical analysis of the singularity structure of the score function by separating it along the tangential and normal directions of the manifold. To mitigate the singularity and improve the sampling accuracy, we propose two novel methods: (1) Niso-DM, which introduces non-isotropic noise along the normal direction to reduce scale discrepancies, and (2) Tango-DM, which trains only the tangential component of the score function using a tangential-only loss function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve superior performance on distributions over various manifolds with complex geometries.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces an interactive continual learning paradigm where AI models dynamically learn new skills from real-time human feedback while retaining prior knowledge. This paradigm distinctively addresses two major limitations of traditional continual learning: (1) dynamic model updates using streaming, real-time human-annotated data, rather than static datasets with fixed labels, and (2) the assumption of clean labels, by explicitly handling the noisy feedback common in real-world interactions. To tackle these problems, we propose RiCL, a Reinforced interactive Continual Learning framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn new skills effectively from dynamic feedback. RiCL incorporates three key components: a temporal consistency-aware purifier to automatically discern clean from noisy samples in data streams; an interaction-aware direct preference optimization strategy to align model behavior with human intent by reconciling AI-generated and human-provided feedback; and a noise-resistant contrastive learning module that captures robust representations by exploiting inherent data relationships, thus avoiding reliance on potentially unreliable labels. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (FewRel and TACRED), contaminated with realistic noise patterns, demonstrate that our RiCL approach substantially outperforms existing combinations of state-of-the-art online continual learning and noisy-label learning methods.",

    "summary": "Understanding the factors contributing to traffic crashes and developing strategies to mitigate their severity is essential. Traditional statistical methods and machine learning models often struggle to capture the complex interactions between various factors and the unique characteristics of each crash. This research leverages large language model (LLM) to analyze freeway crash data and provide crash causation analysis accordingly. By compiling 226 traffic safety studies related to freeway crashes, a training dataset encompassing environmental, driver, traffic, and geometric design factors was created. The Llama3 8B model was fine-tuned using QLoRA to enhance its understanding of freeway crashes and their contributing factors, as covered in these studies. The fine-tuned Llama3 8B model was then used to identify crash causation without pre-labeled data through zero-shot classification, providing comprehensive explanations to ensure that the identified causes were reasonable and aligned with existing research. Results demonstrate that LLMs effectively identify primary crash causes such as alcohol-impaired driving, speeding, aggressive driving, and driver inattention. Incorporating event data, such as road maintenance, offers more profound insights. The model's practical applicability and potential to improve traffic safety measures were validated by a high level of agreement among researchers in the field of traffic safety, as reflected in questionnaire results with 88.89%. This research highlights the complex nature of traffic crashes and how LLMs can be used for comprehensive analysis of crash causation and other contributing factors. Moreover, it provides valuable insights and potential countermeasures to aid planners and policymakers in developing more effective and efficient traffic safety practices.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we focus on a long-term continual learning (CL) task, where a model learns sequentially from a stream of vast tasks over time, acquiring new knowledge while retaining previously learned information in a manner akin to human learning. Unlike traditional CL settings, long-term CL involves handling a significantly larger number of tasks, which exacerbates the issue of catastrophic forgetting. Our work seeks to address two critical questions: 1) How do existing CL methods perform in the context of long-term CL? and 2) How can we mitigate the catastrophic forgetting that arises from prolonged sequential updates? To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework inspired by human memory mechanisms for long-term continual learning (Long-CL). Specifically, we introduce a task-core memory management strategy to efficiently index crucial memories and adaptively update them as learning progresses. Additionally, we develop a long-term memory consolidation mechanism that selectively retains hard and discriminative samples, ensuring robust knowledge retention. To facilitate research in this area, we construct and release two multi-modal and textual benchmarks, MMLongCL-Bench and TextLongCL-Bench, providing a valuable resource for evaluating long-term CL approaches. Experimental results show that Long-CL outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 7.4\\% and 6.5\\% AP on the two benchmarks, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",

As such, we introduce TransPL, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by modeling the joint distribution $P(\\mathbf{X}, y)$ of the source domain through code transition matrices, where the codes are derived from vector quantization (VQ) of time series patches. Our method constructs class- and channel-wise code transition matrices from the source domain and employs Bayes' rule for target domain adaptation, generating pseudo-labels based on channel-wise weighted class-conditional likelihoods. TransPL offers three key advantages: explicit modeling of temporal transitions and channel-wise shifts between different domains, versatility towards different UDA scenarios (e.g., weakly-supervised UDA), and explainable pseudo-label generation. We validate TransPL's effectiveness through extensive analysis on four time series UDA benchmarks and confirm that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pseudo-labeling methods by a strong margin (6.1% accuracy improvement, 4.9% F1 improvement), while providing interpretable insights into the domain adaptation process through its learned code transition matrices.",

    "summary": "Designing a 6G-oriented universal model capable of processing multi-modal data and executing diverse air interface tasks has emerged as a common goal in future wireless systems. Building on our prior work in communication multi-modal alignment and telecom large language model (LLM), we propose a scalable, task-aware artificial intelligence-air interface multi-modal universal model (AI2MMUM), which flexibility and effectively perform various physical layer tasks according to subtle task instructions. The LLM backbone provides robust contextual comprehension and generalization capabilities, while a fine-tuning approach is adopted to incorporate domain-specific knowledge. To enhance task adaptability, task instructions consist of fixed task keywords and learnable, implicit prefix prompts. Frozen radio modality encoders extract universal representations and adapter layers subsequently bridge radio and language modalities. Moreover, lightweight task-specific heads are designed to directly output task objectives. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that AI2MMUM achieves SOTA performance across five representative physical environment/wireless channel-based downstream tasks using the WAIR-D and DeepMIMO datasets.",

    "summary": "Motivated by practical applications where stable long-term performance is critical-such as robotics, operations research, and healthcare-we study the problem of distributionally robust (DR) average-reward reinforcement learning. We propose two algorithms that achieve near-optimal sample complexity. The first reduces the problem to a DR discounted Markov decision process (MDP), while the second, Anchored DR Average-Reward MDP, introduces an anchoring state to stabilize the controlled transition kernels within the uncertainty set. Assuming the nominal MDP is uniformly ergodic, we prove that both algorithms attain a sample complexity of $\\widetilde{O}\\left(|\\mathbf{S}||\\mathbf{A}| t_{\\mathrm{mix}}^2\\varepsilon^{-2}\\right)$ for estimating the optimal policy as well as the robust average reward under KL and $f_k$-divergence-based uncertainty sets, provided the uncertainty radius is sufficiently small. Here, $\\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\\mathbf{S}|$ and $|\\mathbf{A}|$ denote the sizes of the state and action spaces, and $t_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ is the mixing time of the nominal MDP. This represents the first finite-sample convergence guarantee for DR average-reward reinforcement learning. We further validate the convergence rates of our algorithms through numerical experiments.",

    "summary": "A central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is its dependence on extensive real-world interaction data to learn task-specific policies. While recent work demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can mitigate this limitation by generating synthetic experience (noted as imaginary rollouts) for mastering novel tasks, progress in this emerging field is hindered due to the lack of a standard benchmark. To bridge this gap, we introduce ImagineBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating offline RL algorithms that leverage both real rollouts and LLM-imaginary rollouts. The key features of ImagineBench include: (1) datasets comprising environment-collected and LLM-imaginary rollouts; (2) diverse domains of environments covering locomotion, robotic manipulation, and navigation tasks; and (3) natural language task instructions with varying complexity levels to facilitate language-conditioned policy learning. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms, we observe that simply applying existing offline RL algorithms leads to suboptimal performance on unseen tasks, achieving 35.44% success rate in hard tasks in contrast to 64.37% of method training on real rollouts for hard tasks. This result highlights the need for algorithm advancements to better leverage LLM-imaginary rollouts. Additionally, we identify key opportunities for future research: including better utilization of imaginary rollouts, fast online adaptation and continual learning, and extension to multi-modal tasks.

    "summary": "Quantum-classical Hybrid Machine Learning (QHML) models are recognized for their robust performance and high generalization ability even for relatively small datasets. These qualities offer unique advantages for anti-cancer drug response prediction, where the number of available samples is typically small. However, such hybrid models appear to be very sensitive to the data encoding used at the interface of a neural network and a quantum circuit, with suboptimal choices leading to stability issues. To address this problem, we propose a novel strategy that uses a normalization function based on a moderated gradient version of the $\\tanh$. This method transforms the outputs of the neural networks without concentrating them at the extreme value ranges. Our idea was evaluated on a dataset of gene expression and drug response measurements for various cancer cell lines, where we compared the prediction performance of a classical deep learning model and several QHML models. These results confirmed that QHML performed better than the classical models when data was optimally normalized. This study opens up new possibilities for biomedical data analysis using quantum computers.",

    "summary": "Circuit discovery has gradually become one of the prominent methods for mechanistic interpretability, and research on circuit completeness has also garnered increasing attention. Methods of circuit discovery that do not guarantee completeness not only result in circuits that are not fixed across different runs but also cause key mechanisms to be omitted. The nature of incompleteness arises from the presence of OR gates within the circuit, which are often only partially detected in standard circuit discovery methods. To this end, we systematically introduce three types of logic gates: AND, OR, and ADDER gates, and decompose the circuit into combinations of these logical gates. Through the concept of these gates, we derive the minimum requirements necessary to achieve faithfulness and completeness. Furthermore, we propose a framework that combines noising-based and denoising-based interventions, which can be easily integrated into existing circuit discovery methods without significantly increasing computational complexity. This framework is capable of fully identifying the logic gates and distinguishing them within the circuit. In addition to the extensive experimental validation of the framework's ability to restore the faithfulness, completeness, and sparsity of circuits, using this framework, we uncover fundamental properties of the three logic gates, such as their proportions and contributions to the output, and explore how they behave among the functionalities of language models.",

    "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNN) endure catastrophic forgetting, undermining their capacity to preserve previously acquired knowledge amid the assimilation of novel information. Rehearsal-based techniques revisit historical examples, adopted as a principal strategy to alleviate this phenomenon. However, memory explosion and privacy infringements impose significant constraints on their utility. Non-Exemplar methods circumvent the prior issues through Prototype Replay (PR), yet feature drift presents new challenges. In this paper, our empirical findings reveal that Prototype Contrastive Learning (PCL) exhibits less pronounced drift than conventional PR. Drawing upon PCL, we propose Instance-Prototype Affinity Learning (IPAL), a novel paradigm for Non-Exemplar Continual Graph Learning (NECGL). Exploiting graph structural information, we formulate Topology-Integrated Gaussian Prototypes (TIGP), guiding feature distributions towards high-impact nodes to augment the model's capacity for assimilating new knowledge. Instance-Prototype Affinity Distillation (IPAD) safeguards task memory by regularizing discontinuities in class relationships. Moreover, we embed a Decision Boundary Perception (DBP) mechanism within PCL, fostering greater inter-class discriminability. Evaluations on four node classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a better trade-off between plasticity and stability.",

    "summary": "Traditional machine learning models often prioritize predictive accuracy, often at the expense of model transparency and interpretability. The lack of transparency makes it difficult for organizations to comply with regulatory requirements and gain stakeholders trust. In this research, we propose a fraud detection framework that combines a stacking ensemble of well-known gradient boosting models: XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. In addition, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques are used to enhance the transparency and interpretability of the model's decisions. We used SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) for feature selection to identify the most important features. Further efforts were made to explain the model's predictions using Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME), Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI). The IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset, which includes more than 590,000 real transaction records, was used to evaluate the proposed model. The model achieved a high performance with an accuracy of 99% and an AUC-ROC score of 0.99, outperforming several recent related approaches. These results indicate that combining high prediction accuracy with transparent interpretability is possible and could lead to a more ethical and trustworthy solution in financial fraud detection.",

    "summary": "Depth estimation and scene segmentation are two important tasks in intelligent transportation systems. A joint modeling of these two tasks will reduce the requirement for both the storage and training efforts. This work explores how the multi-task distillation could be used to improve such unified modeling. While existing solutions transfer multiple teachers' knowledge in a static way, we propose a self-adaptive distillation method that can dynamically adjust the knowledge amount from each teacher according to the student's current learning ability. Furthermore, as multiple teachers exist, the student's gradient update direction in the distillation is more prone to be erroneous where knowledge forgetting may occur. To avoid this, we propose a knowledge trajectory to record the most essential information that a model has learnt in the past, based on which a trajectory-based distillation loss is designed to guide the student to follow the learning curve similarly in a cost-effective way. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmarking datasets including Cityscapes and NYU-v2. Compared to the state-of-the-art solutions, our method achieves a clearly improvement.

    "summary": "Conventional forecasting methods rely on unimodal time series data, limiting their ability to exploit rich textual information. Recently, large language models (LLMs) and time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated powerful capability in textual reasoning and temporal modeling, respectively. Integrating the strengths of both to construct a multimodal model that concurrently leverages both temporal and textual information for future inference has emerged as a critical research challenge. To address the scarcity of event-series paired data, we propose a decoupled framework: an LLM is employed to transform textual events into revision instructions, which are then used to steer the output of TSFM. To implement this framework, we introduce ChronoSteer, a multimodal TSFM that can be steered through textual revision instructions, effectively bridging LLM and TSFM. Moreover, to mitigate the shortage of cross-modal instruction-series paired data, we devise a two-stage training strategy based on synthetic data. In addition, we also construct a high-quality multimodal time series forecasting benchmark to address the information leakage concerns during evaluation. After integrating with an LLM, ChronoSteer, which is trained exclusively on synthetic data, achieves a 25.7% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to the unimodal backbone and a 22.5% gain over the previous state-of-the-art multimodal method.",

Traditional optimization methods struggle to adapt to real-time changes, domain-expert-designed heuristic approaches suffer from rigid strategies, and existing learning-based methods often lack generalizability and interpretability. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hierarchical language agent framework named MiCo, which provides a large language model (LLM)-driven heuristic design paradigm for solving ODMBP. Specifically, ODMBP is formulated as a Semi-Markov Decision Process with Options (SMDP-Option), enabling dynamic scheduling through a two-stage architecture, i.e., Option Miner and Option Composer. Option Miner utilizes LLMs to discover diverse and useful non-context-aware strategies by interacting with constructed environments. Option Composer employs LLMs to discover a composing strategy that integrates the non-context-aware strategies with the contextual ones. Extensive experiments on real-world enterprise datasets demonstrate that MiCo achieves a 96.9\\% competitive ratio in large-scale scenarios involving more than 10,000 virtual machines. It maintains high performance even under nonstationary request flows and diverse configurations, thus validating its effectiveness in complex and large-scale cloud environments.",

These synthetic tasks serve as independent auxiliary tasks. Our results show consistent and significant performance improvement across all 19 molecular property prediction tasks. For 16 out of 19 targets, the multitask Graph Transformer outperforms the XGBoost single-task learner.

Since each client does not know the data distributions over other clients, the adaptability of the local model cannot be directly optimized. First, we provide the property of an appropriate local model which has good adaptability on the data distributions over clients. Then, we formalize the property into the local training objective with a constraint and propose a feasible solution to train the local model.

We consider $N$ agents grouped into $M$ clusters, where each cluster solves a stochastic bandit problem. The mapping between agents and bandits is a priori unknown. Each bandit is associated with $K$ arms, and the goal is to identify the best arm for each agent under a $\\delta$-probably correct ($\\delta$-PC) framework, while minimizing sample complexity and communication overhead.\nWe propose two novel algorithms: Clustering then Best Arm Identification (Cl-BAI) and Best Arm Identification then Clustering (BAI-Cl). Cl-BAI uses a two-phase approach that first clusters agents based on the bandit problems they are learning, followed by identifying the best arm for each cluster. BAI-Cl reverses the sequence by identifying the best arms first and then clustering agents accordingly. Both algorithms leverage the successive elimination framework to ensure computational efficiency and high accuracy.\nWe establish $\\delta$-PC guarantees for both methods, derive bounds on their sample complexity, and provide a lower bound for this problem class. Moreover, when $M$ is small (a constant), we show that the sample complexity of a variant of BAI-Cl is minimax optimal in an order-wise sense. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets (MovieLens, Yelp) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of sample and communication efficiency, particularly in settings where $M \\ll N$.",

    "summary": "The emergence of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (HQML) models opens new horizons of computational intelligence but their fundamental complexity frequently leads to black box behavior that undermines transparency and reliability in their application. Although XAI for quantum systems still in its infancy, a major research gap is evident in robust global and local explainability approaches that are designed for HQML architectures that employ quantized feature encoding followed by classical learning. The gap is the focus of this work, which introduces QuXAI, an framework based upon Q-MEDLEY, an explainer for explaining feature importance in these hybrid systems. Our model entails the creation of HQML models incorporating quantum feature maps, the use of Q-MEDLEY, which combines feature based inferences, preserving the quantum transformation stage and visualizing the resulting attributions. Our result shows that Q-MEDLEY delineates influential classical aspects in HQML models, as well as separates their noise, and competes well against established XAI techniques in classical validation settings. Ablation studies more significantly expose the virtues of the composite structure used in Q-MEDLEY. The implications of this work are critically important, as it provides a route to improve the interpretability and reliability of HQML models, thus promoting greater confidence and being able to engage in safer and more responsible use of quantum-enhanced AI technology.",

    "summary": "Rapid expansion of model size has emerged as a key challenge in time series forecasting. From early Transformer with tens of megabytes to recent architectures like TimesNet with thousands of megabytes, performance gains have often come at the cost of exponentially increasing parameter counts. But is this scaling truly necessary? To question the applicability of the scaling law in time series forecasting, we propose Alinear, an ultra-lightweight forecasting model that achieves competitive performance using only k-level parameters. We introduce a horizon-aware adaptive decomposition mechanism that dynamically rebalances component emphasis across different forecast lengths, alongside a progressive frequency attenuation strategy that achieves stable prediction in various forecasting horizons without incurring the computational overhead of attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that Alinear consistently outperforms large-scale models while using less than 1% of their parameters, maintaining strong accuracy across both short and ultra-long forecasting horizons. Moreover, to more fairly evaluate model efficiency, we propose a new parameter-aware evaluation metric that highlights the superiority of ALinear under constrained model budgets. Our analysis reveals that the relative importance of trend and seasonal components varies depending on data characteristics rather than following a fixed pattern, validating the necessity of our adaptive design. This work challenges the prevailing belief that larger models are inherently better and suggests a paradigm shift toward more efficient time series modeling.",

    "summary": "In the photolithographic process vital to semiconductor manufacturing, various types of defects appear during EUV pattering. Due to ever-shrinking pattern size, these defects are extremely small and cause false or missed detection during inspection. Specifically, the lack of defect-annotated quality data with good representation of smaller defects has prohibited deployment of deep learning based defect detection models in fabrication lines. To resolve the problem of data unavailability, we artificially generate scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of line patterns with known distribution of defects and autonomously annotate them. We then employ state-of-the-art object detection models to investigate defect detection performance as a function of defect size, much smaller than the pitch width. We find that the real-time object detector YOLOv8 has the best mean average precision of 96% as compared to EfficientNet, 83%, and SSD, 77%, with the ability to detect smaller defects. We report the smallest defect size that can be detected reliably. When tested on real SEM data, the YOLOv8 model correctly detected 84.6% of Bridge defects and 78.3% of Break defects across all relevant instances. These promising results suggest that synthetic data can be used as an alternative to real-world data in order to develop robust machine-learning models.",

    "summary": "Monitoring feeding behaviour is a relevant task for efficient herd management and the effective use of available resources in grazing cattle. The ability to automatically recognise animals' feeding activities through the identification of specific jaw movements allows for the improvement of diet formulation, as well as early detection of metabolic problems and symptoms of animal discomfort, among other benefits. The use of sensors to obtain signals for such monitoring has become popular in the last two decades. The most frequently employed sensors include accelerometers, microphones, and cameras, each with its own set of advantages and drawbacks. An unexplored aspect is the simultaneous use of multiple sensors with the aim of combining signals in order to enhance the precision of the estimations. In this direction, this work introduces a deep neural network based on the fusion of acoustic and inertial signals, composed of convolutional, recurrent, and dense layers. The main advantage of this model is the combination of signals through the automatic extraction of features independently from each of them. The model has emerged from an exploration and comparison of different neural network architectures proposed in this work, which carry out information fusion at different levels. Feature-level fusion has outperformed data and decision-level fusion by at least a 0.14 based on the F1-score metric. Moreover, a comparison with state-of-the-art machine learning methods is presented, including traditional and deep learning approaches. The proposed model yielded an F1-score value of 0.802, representing a 14% increase compared to previous methods. Finally, results from an ablation study and post-training quantization evaluation are also reported.",

The approach systematically infuses LLMs with structured temporal information to improve their forecasting accuracy. This study evaluates the proposed method on a real-world time series dataset and compares it to a naive baseline where the LLM receives no auxiliary information.

Prior methods often model semantic and positional differences disparately or apply uniform positional adjustments across heads, potentially limiting representational capacity. This paper introduces ComplexFormer, featuring Complex Multi-Head Attention-CMHA. CMHA empowers each head to independently model semantic and positional differences unified within the complex plane, representing interactions as rotations and scaling. ComplexFormer incorporates two key improvements: (1) a per-head Euler transformation, converting real-valued query/key projections into polar-form complex vectors for head-specific complex subspace operation; and (2) a per-head adaptive differential rotation mechanism, exp[i(Adapt(ASmn,i) + Delta(Pmn),i)], allowing each head to learn distinct strategies for integrating semantic angle differences (ASmn,i) with relative positional encodings (Delta(Pmn),i). Extensive experiments on language modeling, text generation, code generation, and mathematical reasoning show ComplexFormer achieves superior performance, significantly lower generation perplexity , and improved long-context coherence compared to strong baselines like RoPE-Transformers. ComplexFormer demonstrates strong parameter efficiency, offering a more expressive, adaptable attention mechanism.",

    "summary": "Efficient LLM inference on resource-constrained devices presents significant challenges in compute and memory utilization. Due to limited GPU memory, existing systems offload model weights to CPU memory, incurring substantial I/O overhead between the CPU and GPU. This leads to two major inefficiencies: (1) GPU cores are underutilized, often remaining idle while waiting for data to be loaded; and (2) GPU memory has low impact on performance, as reducing its capacity has minimal effect on overall this http URL this paper, we propose SpecOffload, a high-throughput inference engine that embeds speculative decoding into offloading. Our key idea is to unlock latent GPU resources for storing and executing a draft model used for speculative decoding, thus accelerating inference at near-zero additional cost. To support this, we carefully orchestrate the interleaved execution of target and draft models in speculative decoding within the offloading pipeline, and propose a planner to manage tensor placement and select optimal parameters. Compared to the best baseline, SpecOffload improves GPU core utilization by 4.49x and boosts inference throughput by 2.54x. Our code is available at this https URL .",

    "summary": "The charging scheduling problem of Electric Buses (EBs) is investigated based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is conceived, where the time horizon includes multiple charging and operating periods in a day, while each period is further divided into multiple time steps. To overcome the challenge of long-range multi-phase planning with sparse reward, we conceive Hierarchical DRL (HDRL) for decoupling the original MDP into a high-level Semi-MDP (SMDP) and multiple low-level MDPs. The Hierarchical Double Deep Q-Network (HDDQN)-Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) algorithm is proposed for simultaneously solving the decision problems arising at different temporal resolutions. As a result, the high-level agent learns an effective policy for prescribing the charging targets for every charging period, while the low-level agent learns an optimal policy for setting the charging power of every time step within a single charging period, with the aim of minimizing the charging costs while meeting the charging target. It is proved that the flat policy constructed by superimposing the optimal high-level policy and the optimal low-level policy performs as well as the optimal policy of the original MDP. Since jointly learning both levels of policies is challenging due to the non-stationarity of the high-level agent and the sampling inefficiency of the low-level agent, we divide the joint learning process into two phases and exploit our new HER algorithm to manipulate the experience replay buffers for both levels of agents. Numerical experiments are performed with the aid of real-world data to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.",

Our method leverages a new geometric perspective on fully connected layers to craft malicious model parameters, enabling the perfect recovery of arbitrarily large data batches in classification tasks without any prior knowledge of clients' data.

    "summary": "The growing adoption of Electric Buses (EBs) represents a significant step toward sustainable development. By utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) systems, charging stations can autonomously determine charging schedules based on real-time data. However, optimizing EB charging schedules remains a critical challenge due to uncertainties in travel time, energy consumption, and fluctuating electricity prices. Moreover, to address real-world complexities, charging policies must make decisions efficiently across multiple time scales and remain scalable for large EB fleets. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (HDRL) approach that reformulates the original Markov Decision Process (MDP) into two augmented MDPs. To solve these MDPs and enable multi-timescale decision-making, we introduce a novel HDRL algorithm, namely Double Actor-Critic Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization Enhancement (DAC-MAPPO-E). Scalability challenges of the Double Actor-Critic (DAC) algorithm for large-scale EB fleets are addressed through enhancements at both decision levels. At the high level, we redesign the decentralized actor network and integrate an attention mechanism to extract relevant global state information for each EB, decreasing the size of neural networks. At the low level, the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm is incorporated into the DAC framework, enabling decentralized and coordinated charging power decisions, reducing computational complexity and enhancing convergence speed. Extensive experiments with real-world data demonstrate the superior performance and scalability of DAC-MAPPO-E in optimizing EB fleet charging schedules.",

However, the heterogeneous nature of such devices produces diverse, non-independent, and identically distributed (non-IID) data, making the detection of backdoor attacks more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel federated representative-attention-based defense mechanism, named FeRA, that leverages cross-client attention over internal feature representations to distinguish benign from malicious clients. FeRA computes an anomaly score based on representation reconstruction errors, effectively identifying clients whose internal activations significantly deviate from the group consensus. Our evaluation demonstrates FeRA's robustness across various FL scenarios, including challenging non-IID data distributions typical of edge devices. Experimental results show that it effectively reduces backdoor attack success rates while maintaining high accuracy on the main task. The method is model-agnostic, attack-agnostic, and does not require labeled reference data, making it well suited to heterogeneous and resource-limited edge deployments.",

    "summary": "Decentralized optimization has become vital for leveraging distributed data without central control, enhancing scalability and privacy. However, practical deployments face fundamental challenges due to heterogeneous computation speeds and unpredictable communication delays. This paper introduces a refined model of Asynchronous Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (ADSGD) under practical assumptions of bounded computation and communication times. To understand the convergence of ADSGD, we first analyze Asynchronous Stochastic Block Coordinate Descent (ASBCD) as a tool, and then show that ADSGD converges under computation-delay-independent step sizes. The convergence result is established without assuming bounded data heterogeneity. Empirical experiments reveal that ADSGD outperforms existing methods in wall-clock convergence time across various scenarios. With its simplicity, efficiency in memory and communication, and resilience to communication and computation delays, ADSGD is well-suited for real-world decentralized learning tasks.",

    "summary": "AI is foreseen to be a centerpiece in next generation wireless networks enabling enabling ubiquitous communication as well as new services. However, in real deployment, feature distribution changes may degrade the performance of AI models and lead to undesired behaviors. To counter for undetected model degradation, we propose ALERT; a method that can detect feature distribution changes and trigger model re-training that works well on two wireless network use cases: wireless fingerprinting and link anomaly detection. ALERT includes three components: representation learning, statistical testing and utility assessment. We rely on MLP for designing the representation learning component, on Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Population Stability Index tests for designing the statistical testing and a new function for utility assessment. We show the superiority of the proposed method against ten standard drift detection methods available in the literature on two wireless network use cases.",

    "summary": "Real-world autonomous decision-making systems, from robots to recommendation engines, must operate in environments that change over time. While deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown an impressive ability to learn optimal policies in stationary environments, most methods are data intensive and assume a world that does not change between training and test time. As a result, conventional RL methods struggle to adapt when conditions change. This poses a fundamental challenge: how can RL agents efficiently adapt their behavior when encountering novel environmental changes during deployment without catastrophically forgetting useful prior knowledge? This dissertation demonstrates that efficient online adaptation requires two key capabilities: (1) prioritized exploration and sampling strategies that help identify and learn from relevant experiences, and (2) selective preservation of prior knowledge through structured representations that can be updated without disruption to reusable components.",

    "summary": "Randomness is ubiquitous in many applications across data science and machine learning. Remarkably, systems composed of random components often display emergent global behaviors that appear deterministic, manifesting a transition from microscopic disorder to macroscopic organization. In this work, we introduce a theoretical model for studying the emergence of collective behaviors in ensembles of random classifiers. We argue that, if the ensemble is weighted through the Gibbs measure defined by adopting the classification loss as an energy, then there exists a finite temperature parameter for the distribution such that the classification is optimal, with respect to the loss (or the energy). Interestingly, for the case in which samples are generated by a Gaussian distribution and labels are constructed by employing a teacher perceptron, we analytically prove and numerically confirm that such optimal temperature does not depend neither on the teacher classifier (which is, by construction of the learning problem, unknown), nor on the number of random classifiers, highlighting the universal nature of the observed behavior. Experiments on the MNIST dataset underline the relevance of this phenomenon in high-quality, noiseless, datasets. Finally, a physical analogy allows us to shed light on the self-organizing nature of the studied phenomenon.",

Typically, an encoder network defines the parameters of a Gaussian distributed latent space from which we can sample and pass realizations to a decoder network. This model is trained to reconstruct its inputs and is optimized through the evidence lower bound. In recent years, discrete latent spaces have grown in popularity, suggesting that they may be a natural choice for many data modalities (e.g. text). In this tutorial, we provide a rigorous, yet practical, introduction to discrete variational autoencoders -- specifically, VAEs in which the latent space is made up of latent variables that follow a categorical distribution. We assume only a basic mathematical background with which we carefully derive each step from first principles. From there, we develop a concrete training recipe and provide an example implementation, hosted at this https URL.",

However, recent critiques suggest that equally weighted tasks can achieve competitive results compared to SMTOs, arguing that previous SMTO results were influenced by poor hyperparameter optimization and lack of regularization. In this work, we evaluate these claims through an extensive empirical evaluation of SMTOs, including some of the latest methods, on more complex multi-task problems to clarify this behavior. Our findings indicate that SMTOs perform well compared to uniform loss and that fixed weights can achieve competitive performance compared to SMTOs. Furthermore, we demonstrate why uniform loss perform similarly to SMTOs in some instances. The code will be made publicly available.",

However, these AI scribes still rely on one-shot, or few-shot prompts for generating notes after the consultation has ended, employing little to no reasoning. This risks long notes with an increase in hallucinations, misrepresentation of the intent of the clinician, and reliance on the proofreading of the clinician to catch errors. A dangerous combination for patient safety if vigilance is compromised by workload and fatigue. In this paper, we introduce a method for extracting salient clinical information in real-time alongside the healthcare consultation, denoted Facts, and use that information recursively to generate the final note.

    "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a principled framework for learning over graph-structured data, yet their expressive capacity is often hindered by over-squashing, wherein information from distant nodes is compressed into fixed-size vectors. Existing solutions, including graph rewiring and bottleneck-resistant architectures such as Cayley and expander graphs, avoid this problem but introduce scalability bottlenecks. In particular, the Cayley graphs constructed over $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z}_n)$ exhibit strong theoretical properties, yet suffer from cubic node growth $O(n^3)$, leading to high memory usage. To address this, this work introduces Schrier-Coset Graph Propagation (SCGP), a group-theoretic augmentation method that enriches node features through Schreier-coset embeddings without altering the input graph topology. SCGP embeds bottleneck-free connectivity patterns into a compact feature space, improving long-range message passing while maintaining computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations across standard node and graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that SCGP achieves performance comparable to, or exceeding, expander graph and rewired GNN baselines. Furthermore, SCGP exhibits particular advantages in processing hierarchical and modular graph structures, offering reduced inference latency, improved scalability, and a low memory footprint, making it suitable for real-time and resource-constrained applications.",

    "summary": "A generative model for the mesh geometry of intracranial aneurysms (IA) is crucial for training networks to predict blood flow forces in real time, which is a key factor affecting disease progression. This need is necessitated by the absence of a large IA image datasets. Existing shape generation methods struggle to capture realistic IA features and ignore the relationship between IA pouches and parent vessels, limiting physiological realism and their generation cannot be controlled to have specific morphological measurements. We propose AneuG, a two-stage Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based IA mesh generator. In the first stage, AneuG generates low-dimensional Graph Harmonic Deformation (GHD) tokens to encode and reconstruct aneurysm pouch shapes, constrained to morphing energy statistics truths. GHD enables more accurate shape encoding than alternatives. In the second stage, AneuG generates parent vessels conditioned on GHD tokens, by generating vascular centreline and propagating the cross-section. AneuG's IA shape generation can further be conditioned to have specific clinically relevant morphological measurements. This is useful for studies to understand shape variations represented by clinical measurements, and for flow simulation studies to understand effects of specific clinical shape parameters on fluid dynamics.

    "summary": "Human learning relies on specialization -- distinct cognitive mechanisms working together to enable rapid learning. In contrast, most modern neural networks rely on a single mechanism: gradient descent over an objective function. This raises the question: might human learners' relatively rapid learning from just tens of examples instead of tens of thousands in data-driven deep learning arise from our ability to use multiple specialized mechanisms of learning in combination? We investigate this question through an ablation analysis of inductive human learning simulations in online tutoring environments. Comparing reinforcement learning to a more data-efficient 3-mechanism symbolic rule induction approach, we find that decomposing learning into multiple distinct mechanisms significantly improves data efficiency, bringing it in line with human learning. Furthermore, we show that this decomposition has a greater impact on efficiency than the distinction between symbolic and subsymbolic learning alone. Efforts to align data-driven machine learning with human learning often overlook the stark difference in learning efficiency. Our findings suggest that integrating multiple specialized learning mechanisms may be key to bridging this gap.",

Our main result shows that if a parametric model can be learned using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (bSGD) without making assumptions about the data distribution, then with high probability, the target function can also be approximated using a polynomial-sized combination of random features. The size of this combination depends on the number of gradient steps and numerical precision used in the bSGD process. This finding reveals fundamental limitations of distribution-free learning in neural networks trained by gradient descent, highlighting why making assumptions about data distributions is often crucial in practice. Along the way, we also introduce a new theoretical framework called average probabilistic dimension complexity (adc), which extends the probabilistic dimension complexity developed by Kamath et al. (2020). We prove that adc has a polynomial relationship with statistical query dimension, and use this relationship to demonstrate an infinite separation between adc and standard dimension complexity.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks thanks to advances in reasoning abilities. However, existing methods overlook the trade-off between reasoning effectiveness and computational efficiency, often encouraging unnecessarily long reasoning chains and wasting tokens. To address this, we propose Learning to Think (L2T), an information-theoretic reinforcement fine-tuning framework for LLMs to make the models achieve optimal reasoning with fewer tokens. Specifically, L2T treats each query-response interaction as a hierarchical session of multiple episodes and proposes a universal dense process reward, i.e., quantifies the episode-wise information gain in parameters, requiring no extra annotations or task-specific evaluators. We propose a method to quickly estimate this reward based on PAC-Bayes bounds and the Fisher information matrix. Theoretical analyses show that it significantly reduces computational complexity with high estimation accuracy. By immediately rewarding each episode's contribution and penalizing excessive updates, L2T optimizes the model via reinforcement learning to maximize the use of each episode and achieve effective updates. Empirical results on various reasoning benchmarks and base models demonstrate the advantage of L2T across different tasks, boosting both reasoning effectiveness and efficiency.",

    "summary": "Clouds and precipitation are important for understanding weather and climate. Simulating clouds and precipitation with traditional numerical weather prediction is challenging because of the sub-grid parameterizations required. Machine learning has been explored for forecasting clouds and precipitation, but early machine learning methods often created blurry forecasts. In this paper we explore a newer method, named score-based diffusion, to nowcast (zero to three hour forecast) clouds and precipitation. We discuss the background and intuition of score-based diffusion models - thus providing a starting point for the community - while exploring the methodology's use for nowcasting geostationary infrared imagery. We experiment with three main types of diffusion models: a standard score-based diffusion model (Diff); a residual correction diffusion model (CorrDiff); and a latent diffusion model (LDM). Our results show that the diffusion models are able to not only advect existing clouds, but also generate and decay clouds, including convective initiation. These results are surprising because the forecasts are initiated with only the past 20 mins of infrared satellite imagery. A case study qualitatively shows the preservation of high resolution features longer into the forecast than a conventional mean-squared error trained U-Net. The best of the three diffusion models tested was the CorrDiff approach, outperforming all other diffusion models, the traditional U-Net, and a persistence forecast by one to two kelvin on root mean squared error. The diffusion models also enable out-of-the-box ensemble generation, which shows skillful calibration, with the spread of the ensemble correlating well to the error.",

    "summary": "Gas turbine engines represent complex highly nonlinear dynamical systems. Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging as it requires performance characteristics, that are not always available, and one often has to make many simplifying assumptions. In this paper, the limitations of conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally linear parameter-varying models are discussed and addressed by employing identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics were estimated using the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous part of the dynamics was mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman eigenfunction space. The process included eigenvalue optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model was validated against an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear feedback controller and a Kalman estimator were then designed in the eigenfunction space and compared to the classical and gain-scheduled proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control approach. The eigenmode structure allowed targeting individual modes during the optimization process, resulting in a better performance tuning. The results showed that the Koopman-based controller outperformed the other benchmark controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection, under sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.",

To this end, we conceive a novel anomaly detection method called PIF, that combines the advantages of adaptive isolation methods with the flexibility of preference embedding. Specifically, we propose to embed the data in a high dimensional space where an efficient tree-based method, PI-Forest, is employed to compute an anomaly score. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that PIF favorably compares with state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques, and confirm that PI-Forest is better at measuring arbitrary distances and isolate points in the preference space.",

    "summary": "Incremental learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model learns from a sequential stream of tasks. This setting poses a key challenge: balancing plasticity (learning new tasks) and stability (preserving past knowledge). Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a branch of AutoML, automates the design of the architecture of Deep Neural Networks and has shown success in static settings. However, existing NAS-based approaches to incremental learning often rely on expanding the model at every task, making them impractical in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we introduce SEAL, a NAS-based framework tailored for data-incremental learning, a scenario where disjoint data samples arrive sequentially and are not stored for future access. SEAL adapts the model structure dynamically by expanding it only when necessary, based on a capacity estimation metric. Stability is preserved through cross-distillation training after each expansion step. The NAS component jointly searches for both the architecture and the optimal expansion policy. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SEAL effectively reduces forgetting and enhances accuracy while maintaining a lower model size compared to prior methods. These results highlight the promise of combining NAS and selective expansion for efficient, adaptive learning in incremental scenarios.",

    "summary": "The success of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on the observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this neural scaling law -- the finding that loss decreases as a power law with model size -- remains unclear. Starting from two empirical principles -- that LLMs represent more things than the model dimensions (widths) they have (i.e., representations are superposed), and that words or concepts in language occur with varying frequencies -- we constructed a toy model to study the loss scaling with model size. We found that when superposition is weak, meaning only the most frequent features are represented without interference, the scaling of loss with model size depends on the underlying feature frequency; if feature frequencies follow a power law, so does the loss. In contrast, under strong superposition, where all features are represented but overlap with each other, the loss becomes inversely proportional to the model dimension across a wide range of feature frequency distributions. This robust scaling behavior is explained geometrically: when many more vectors are packed into a lower dimensional space, the interference (squared overlaps) between vectors scales inversely with that dimension. We then analyzed four families of open-sourced LLMs and found that they exhibit strong superposition and quantitatively match the predictions of our toy model. The Chinchilla scaling law turned out to also agree with our results. We conclude that representation superposition is an important mechanism underlying the observed neural scaling laws. We anticipate that these insights will inspire new training strategies and model architectures to achieve better performance with less computation and fewer parameters.",

    "summary": "Effective communication about breast and cervical cancers remains a persistent health challenge, with significant gaps in public understanding of cancer prevention, screening, and treatment, potentially leading to delayed diagnoses and inadequate treatments. This study evaluates the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate, safe, and accessible cancer-related information to support patient understanding. We evaluated five general-purpose and three medical LLMs using a mixed-methods evaluation framework across linguistic quality, safety and trustworthiness, and communication accessibility and affectiveness. Our approach utilized quantitative metrics, qualitative expert ratings, and statistical analysis using Welch's ANOVA, Games-Howell, and Hedges' g. Our results show that general-purpose LLMs produced outputs of higher linguistic quality and affectiveness, while medical LLMs demonstrate greater communication accessibility. However, medical LLMs tend to exhibit higher levels of potential harm, toxicity, and bias, reducing their performance in safety and trustworthiness. Our findings indicate a duality between domain-specific knowledge and safety in health communications. The results highlight the need for intentional model design with targeted improvements, particularly in mitigating harm and bias, and improving safety and affectiveness. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for cancer communication, offering critical insights for improving AI-generated health content and informing future development of accurate, safe, and accessible digital health tools.",

    "summary": "It is commonly believed that scaling language models should commit a significant space or time cost, by increasing the parameters (parameter scaling) or output tokens (inference-time scaling). We introduce the third and more inference-efficient scaling paradigm: increasing the model's parallel computation during both training and inference time. We apply $P$ diverse and learnable transformations to the input, execute forward passes of the model in parallel, and dynamically aggregate the $P$ outputs. This method, namely parallel scaling (ParScale), scales parallel computation by reusing existing parameters and can be applied to any model structure, optimization procedure, data, or task. We theoretically propose a new scaling law and validate it through large-scale pre-training, which shows that a model with $P$ parallel streams is similar to scaling the parameters by $O(\\log P)$ while showing superior inference efficiency. For example, ParScale can use up to 22$\\times$ less memory increase and 6$\\times$ less latency increase compared to parameter scaling that achieves the same performance improvement. It can also recycle an off-the-shelf pre-trained model into a parallelly scaled one by post-training on a small amount of tokens, further reducing the training budget. The new scaling law we discovered potentially facilitates the deployment of more powerful models in low-resource scenarios, and provides an alternative perspective for the role of computation in machine learning.",

    "summary": "Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.",

    "summary": "Value function decomposition methods for cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning compose joint values from individual per-agent utilities, and train them using a joint objective. To ensure that the action selection process between individual utilities and joint values remains consistent, it is imperative for the composition to satisfy the individual-global max (IGM) property. Although satisfying IGM itself is straightforward, most existing methods (e.g., VDN, QMIX) have limited representation capabilities and are unable to represent the full class of IGM values, and the one exception that has no such limitation (QPLEX) is unnecessarily complex. In this work, we present a simple formulation of the full class of IGM values that naturally leads to the derivation of QFIX, a novel family of value function decomposition models that expand the representation capabilities of prior models by means of a thin \"fixing\" layer. We derive multiple variants of QFIX, and implement three variants in two well-known multi-agent frameworks. We perform an empirical evaluation on multiple SMACv2 and Overcooked environments, which confirms that QFIX (i) succeeds in enhancing the performance of prior methods, (ii) learns more stably and performs better than its main competitor QPLEX, and (iii) achieves this while employing the simplest and smallest mixing models.",

We present a novel router-based architecture that leverages domain resources like content metadata and structured knowledge graphs, along with text-to-text and vision-to-text language models to generate high-quality synthetic training data. Our architecture's flexible routing mechanism enables synthetic data generation that matches observed real-world distributions, addressing a fundamental limitation of traditional approaches.

    "summary": "Recently, post hoc explanation methods have emerged to enhance model transparency by attributing model outputs to input features. However, these methods face challenges due to their specificity to certain neural network architectures and data modalities. Existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) frameworks have attempted to address these challenges but suffer from several limitations. These include limited flexibility to diverse model architectures and data modalities due to hard-coded implementations, a restricted number of supported XAI methods because of the requirements for layer-specific operations of attribution methods, and sub-optimal recommendations of explanations due to the lack of evaluation and optimization phases. Consequently, these limitations impede the adoption of XAI technology in real-world applications, making it difficult for practitioners to select the optimal explanation method for their domain. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{PnPXAI}, a universal XAI framework that supports diverse data modalities and neural network models in a Plug-and-Play (PnP) manner. PnPXAI automatically detects model architectures, recommends applicable explanation methods, and optimizes hyperparameters for optimal explanations. We validate the framework's effectiveness through user surveys and showcase its versatility across various domains, including medicine and finance.",

However, applying this technique to vision-language models (VLMs) presents two fundamental challenges: small language models that could serve as efficient drafters lack the architectural components to process visual inputs, and their token predictions fail to match those of VLM target models that consider visual context. We introduce Multimodal Adaptation and Self-Data Distillation for Speculative Decoding of Vision-Language Models (MASSV), which transforms existing small language models into effective multimodal drafters through a two-phase approach. MASSV first connects the target VLM's vision encoder to the draft model via a lightweight trainable projector, then applies self-distilled visual instruction tuning using responses generated by the target VLM to align token predictions. Comprehensive experiments across the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma3 model families demonstrate that MASSV increases accepted length by up to 30% and delivers end-to-end inference speedups of up to 1.46x on visually-grounded tasks. MASSV provides a scalable, architecture-compatible method for accelerating both current and future VLMs.",

We demonstrate that the AI model -- an Adversarial Autoencoder neural network in this case -- accurately reconstructs time-dependent health signals and captures nonlinear responses to pollution.

Mel spectrograms were generated from the modified audio, then used to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network.

    "summary": "Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disease with millions of patients worldwide. Many patients have turned to alternative medicine due to the limited efficacy and side effects of conventional antiepileptic drugs. In this study, we developed a computational approach to optimize herbal epilepsy treatment through AI-driven analysis of global natural products and statistically validated randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Our intelligent prescription system combines machine learning (ML) algorithms for herb-efficacy characterization, Bayesian optimization for personalized dosing, and meta-analysis of RCTs for evidence-based recommendations. The system analyzed 1,872 natural compounds from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Ayurveda, and ethnopharmacological databases, integrating their bioactive properties with clinical outcomes from 48 RCTs covering 48 epilepsy conditions (n=5,216). Using LASSO regression and SHAP value analysis, we identified 17 high-efficacy herbs (e.g., Gastrodia elata [using √© for accented characters], Withania somnifera), showing significant seizure reduction (p$<$0.01, Cohen's d=0.89) with statistical significance confirmed by multiple testing (p$<$0.001). A randomized double-blind validation trial (n=120) demonstrated 28.5\\% greater seizure frequency reduction with AI-optimized herbal prescriptions compared to conventional protocols (95\\% CI: 18.7-37.3\\%, p=0.003).",

We propose an approach to exploit the Graph Convolution operation in GNNs to encode the context and use it in coalition with LSTMs to predict the next word given a local context of preceding words.

The rapid evolution of Geospatial Representation Learning is fundamentally reshaping LI development through two successive technological revolutions: the deep learning breakthrough and the emerging large language model (LLM) paradigm. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in automated feature extraction from structured geospatial data (e.g., satellite imagery, GPS trajectories), the recent integration of LLMs introduces transformative capabilities for cross-modal geospatial reasoning and unstructured geo-textual data processing. This survey presents a comprehensive review of geospatial representation learning across both technological eras, organizing them into a structured taxonomy based on the complete pipeline comprising: (1) data perspective, (2) methodological perspective and (3) application perspective. We also highlight current advancements, discuss existing limitations, and propose potential future research directions in the LLM era.

    "summary": "The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have led to the emergence of quantum machine learning (QML), which integrates the strengths of both fields. Among QML approaches, variational quantum circuits (VQCs), also known as quantum neural networks (QNNs), have shown promise both empirically and theoretically. However, their broader adoption is hindered by reliance on quantum hardware during inference. Hardware imperfections and limited access to quantum devices pose practical challenges. To address this, the Quantum-Train (QT) framework leverages the exponential scaling of quantum amplitudes to generate classical neural network parameters, enabling inference without quantum hardware and achieving significant parameter compression. Yet, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for such quantum-enhanced neural programmers remains non-trivial and often requires expertise in quantum information science. In this paper, we propose an automated solution using differentiable optimization. Our method jointly optimizes both conventional circuit parameters and architectural parameters in an end-to-end manner via automatic differentiation. We evaluate the proposed framework on classification, time-series prediction, and reinforcement learning tasks. Simulation results show that our method matches or outperforms manually designed QNN architectures. This work offers a scalable and automated pathway for designing QNNs that can generate classical neural network parameters across diverse applications.",

However, while LLM prompts consist of both the task-agnostic system prompts and task-specific user prompts, existing work on prompt optimization has focused on user prompts specific to individual queries or tasks, and largely overlooked the system prompt that is, once optimized, applicable across different tasks and domains. Motivated by this, we introduce the novel problem of bilevel system prompt optimization, whose objective is to design system prompts that are robust to diverse user prompts and transferable to unseen tasks. To tackle this problem, we then propose a meta-learning framework, which meta-learns the system prompt by optimizing it over various user prompts across multiple datasets, while simultaneously updating the user prompts in an iterative manner to ensure synergy between them. We conduct experiments on 14 unseen datasets spanning 5 different domains, on which we show that our approach produces system prompts that generalize effectively to diverse user prompts. Also, our findings reveal that the optimized system prompt enables rapid adaptation even to unseen tasks, requiring fewer optimization steps for test-time user prompts while achieving improved performance.",

    "summary": "Dryland vegetation ecosystems are known to be susceptible to critical transitions between alternative stable states when subjected to external forcing. Such transitions are often discussed through the framework of bifurcation theory, but the spatial patterning of vegetation, which is characteristic of drylands, leads to dynamics that are much more complex and diverse than local bifurcations. Recent methodological developments in Early Warning Signal (EWS) detection have shown promise in identifying dynamical signatures of oncoming critical transitions, with particularly strong predictive capabilities being demonstrated by deep neural networks. However, a machine learning model trained on synthetic examples is only useful if it can effectively transfer to a test case of practical interest. These models' capacity to generalize in this manner has been demonstrated for bifurcation transitions, but it is not as well characterized for high-dimensional phase transitions. This paper explores the successes and shortcomings of neural EWS detection for spatially patterned phase transitions, and shows how these models can be used to gain insight into where and how EWS-relevant information is encoded in spatiotemporal dynamics. A few paradigmatic test systems are used to illustrate how the capabilities of such models can be probed in a number of ways, with particular attention to the performances of a number of proposed statistical indicators for EWS and to the supplementary task of distinguishing between abrupt and continuous transitions. Results reveal that model performance often changes dramatically when training and test data sources are interchanged, which offers new insight into the criteria for model generalization.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a risk-aware safe reinforcement learning (RL) control design for stochastic discrete-time linear systems. Rather than using a safety certifier to myopically intervene with the RL controller, a risk-informed safe controller is also learned besides the RL controller, and the RL and safe controllers are combined together. Several advantages come along with this approach: 1) High-confidence safety can be certified without relying on a high-fidelity system model and using limited data available, 2) Myopic interventions and convergence to an undesired equilibrium can be avoided by deciding on the contribution of two stabilizing controllers, and 3) highly efficient and computationally tractable solutions can be provided by optimizing over a scalar decision variable and linear programming polyhedral sets. To learn safe controllers with a large invariant set, piecewise affine controllers are learned instead of linear controllers. To this end, the closed-loop system is first represented using collected data, a decision variable, and noise. The effect of the decision variable on the variance of the safe violation of the closed-loop system is formalized. The decision variable is then designed such that the probability of safety violation for the learned closed-loop system is minimized. It is shown that this control-oriented approach reduces the data requirements and can also reduce the variance of safety violations. Finally, to integrate the safe and RL controllers, a new data-driven interpolation technique is introduced. This method aims to maintain the RL agent's optimal implementation while ensuring its safety within environments characterized by noise. The study concludes with a simulation example that serves to validate the theoretical results.",

    "summary": "Accurate prediction of pure component physiochemical properties is crucial for process integration, multiscale modeling, and optimization. In this work, an enhanced framework for pure component property prediction by using explainable machine learning methods is proposed. In this framework, the molecular representation method based on the connectivity matrix effectively considers atomic bonding relationships to automatically generate features. The supervised machine learning model random forest is applied for feature ranking and pooling. The adjusted R2 is introduced to penalize the inclusion of additional features, providing an assessment of the true contribution of features. The prediction results for normal boiling point (Tb), liquid molar volume, critical temperature (Tc) and critical pressure (Pc) obtained using Artificial Neural Network and Gaussian Process Regression models confirm the accuracy of the molecular representation method. Comparison with GC based models shows that the root-mean-square error on the test set can be reduced by up to 83.8%. To enhance the interpretability of the model, a feature analysis method based on Shapley values is employed to determine the contribution of each feature to the property predictions. The results indicate that using the feature pooling method reduces the number of features from 13316 to 100 without compromising model accuracy. The feature analysis results for Tb, Tc, and Pc confirms that different molecular properties are influenced by different structural features, aligning with mechanistic interpretations. In conclusion, the proposed framework is demonstrated to be feasible and provides a solid foundation for mixture component reconstruction and process integration modelling.",

    "summary": "In many scientific and industrial applications, we are given a handful of instances (a 'small ensemble') of a spatially distributed quantity (a 'field') but would like to acquire many more. For example, a large ensemble of global temperature sensitivity fields from a climate model can help farmers, insurers, and governments plan appropriately. When acquiring more data is prohibitively expensive -- as is the case with climate models -- statistical emulation offers an efficient alternative for simulating synthetic yet realistic fields. However, parameter inference using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is computationally prohibitive, especially for large, non-stationary fields. Thus, many recent works train neural networks to estimate parameters given spatial fields as input, sidestepping MLE completely. In this work we focus on a popular class of parametric, spatially autoregressive (SAR) models. We make a simple yet impactful observation; because the SAR parameters can be arranged on a regular grid, both inputs (spatial fields) and outputs (model parameters) can be viewed as images. Using this insight, we demonstrate that image-to-image (I2I) networks enable faster and more accurate parameter estimation for a class of non-stationary SAR models with unprecedented complexity.",

    "summary": "Clustering patient subgroups is essential for personalized care and efficient resource use. Traditional clustering methods struggle with high-dimensional, heterogeneous healthcare data and lack contextual understanding. This study evaluates Large Language Model (LLM) based clustering against classical methods using a pediatric sepsis dataset from a low-income country (LIC), containing 2,686 records with 28 numerical and 119 categorical variables. Patient records were serialized into text with and without a clustering objective. Embeddings were generated using quantized LLAMA 3.1 8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B with low-rank adaptation(LoRA), and Stella-En-400M-V5 models. K-means clustering was applied to these embeddings. Classical comparisons included K-Medoids clustering on UMAP and FAMD-reduced mixed data. Silhouette scores and statistical tests evaluated cluster quality and distinctiveness. Stella-En-400M-V5 achieved the highest Silhouette Score (0.86). LLAMA 3.1 8B with the clustering objective performed better with higher number of clusters, identifying subgroups with distinct nutritional, clinical, and socioeconomic profiles. LLM-based methods outperformed classical techniques by capturing richer context and prioritizing key features. These results highlight potential of LLMs for contextual phenotyping and informed decision-making in resource-limited settings.",

    "summary": "State-of-the-art upper limb myoelectric prostheses often use pattern recognition (PR) control systems that translate electromyography (EMG) signals into desired movements. As prosthesis movement complexity increases, users often struggle to produce sufficiently distinct EMG patterns for reliable classification. Existing training typically involves heuristic, trial-and-error user adjustments to static decoder boundaries. Goal: We introduce the Reviewer, a 3D visual interface projecting EMG signals directly into the decoder's classification space, providing intuitive, real-time insight into PR algorithm behavior. This structured feedback reduces cognitive load and fosters mutual, data-driven adaptation between user-generated EMG patterns and decoder boundaries. Methods: A 10-session study with 12 able-bodied participants compared PR performance after motor-based training and updating using the Reviewer versus conventional virtual arm visualization. Performance was assessed using a Fitts law task that involved the aperture of the cursor and the control of orientation. Results: Participants trained with the Reviewer achieved higher completion rates, reduced overshoot, and improved path efficiency and throughput compared to the standard visualization group. Significance: The Reviewer introduces decoder-informed motor training, facilitating immediate and consistent PR-based myoelectric control improvements. By iteratively refining control through real-time feedback, this approach reduces reliance on trial-and-error recalibration, enabling a more adaptive, self-correcting training framework. Conclusion: The 3D visual feedback significantly improves PR control in novice operators through structured training, enabling feedback-driven adaptation and reducing reliance on extensive heuristic adjustments.",

    "summary": "In the context of mobile navigation in unstructured environments, the predominant approach entails the avoidance of obstacles. The prevailing path planning algorithms are contingent upon deviating from the intended path for an indefinite duration and returning to the closest point on the route after the obstacle is left behind spatially. However, avoiding an obstacle on a path that will be used repeatedly by multiple agents can hinder long-term efficiency and lead to a lasting reliance on an active path planning system. In this study, we propose an alternative approach to mobile navigation in unstructured environments by leveraging the manipulation capabilities of a robotic manipulator mounted on top of a mobile robot. Our proposed framework integrates exteroceptive and proprioceptive feedback to assess the push affordance of obstacles, facilitating their repositioning rather than avoidance. While our preliminary visual estimation takes into account the characteristics of both the obstacle and the surface it relies on, the push affordance estimation module exploits the force feedback obtained by interacting with the obstacle via a robotic manipulator as the guidance signal. The objective of our navigation approach is to enhance the efficiency of routes utilized by multiple agents over extended periods by reducing the overall time spent by a fleet in environments where autonomous infrastructure development is imperative, such as lunar or Martian surfaces.",

Security Operations Centre (SOC) analysts triage these alerts to identify malicious activity, but they struggle with alert fatigue due to the overwhelming number of benign alerts. Organisations are turning to managed SOC providers, where the problem is amplified by context switching and limited visibility into business processes.\nA novel system, named AACT, is introduced that automates SOC workflows by learning from analysts' triage actions on cybersecurity alerts. It accurately predicts triage decisions in real time, allowing benign alerts to be closed automatically and critical ones prioritised. This reduces the SOC queue allowing analysts to focus on the most severe, relevant or ambiguous threats. The system has been trained and evaluated on both real SOC data and an open dataset, obtaining high performance in identifying malicious alerts from benign alerts.\nAdditionally, the system has demonstrated high accuracy in a real SOC environment, reducing alerts shown to analysts by 61% over six months, with a low false negative rate of 1.36% over millions of alerts.",

    "summary": "Understanding and predicting human behavior in-thewild, particularly at urban intersections, remains crucial for enhancing interaction safety between road users. Among the most critical behaviors are crossing intentions of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs), where misinterpretation may result in dangerous conflicts with oncoming vehicles. In this work, we propose the VRU-CIPI framework with a sequential attention-based model designed to predict VRU crossing intentions at intersections. VRU-CIPI employs Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture temporal dynamics in VRU movements, combined with a multi-head Transformer self-attention mechanism to encode contextual and spatial dependencies critical for predicting crossing direction. Evaluated on UCF-VRU dataset, our proposed achieves state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 96.45% and achieving real-time inference speed reaching 33 frames per second. Furthermore, by integrating with Infrastructure-to-Vehicles (I2V) communication, our approach can proactively enhance intersection safety through timely activation of crossing signals and providing early warnings to connected vehicles, ensuring smoother and safer interactions for all road users.",

    "summary": "The advent of large language models (LLMs) has allowed numerous applications, including the generation of queried responses, to be leveraged in chatbots and other conversational assistants. Being trained on a plethora of data, LLMs often undergo high levels of over-fitting, resulting in the generation of extra and incorrect data, thus causing hallucinations in output generation. One of the root causes of such problems is the lack of timely, factual, and personalized information fed to the LLM. In this paper, we propose an approach to address these problems by introducing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist the LLM in personalized response generation tailored to the users. KGs have the advantage of storing continuously updated factual information in a structured way. While our KGs can be used for a variety of frequently updated personal data, such as calendar, contact, and location data, we focus on calendar data in this paper. Our experimental results show that our approach works significantly better in understanding personal information and generating accurate responses compared to the baseline LLMs using personal data as text inputs, with a moderate reduction in response time.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces an automated framework WSW2.0 for analyzing vocal interactions in preschool classrooms, enhancing both accuracy and scalability through the integration of wav2vec2-based speaker classification and Whisper (large-v2 and large-v3) speech transcription. A total of 235 minutes of audio recordings (160 minutes from 12 children and 75 minutes from 5 teachers), were used to compare system outputs to expert human annotations. WSW2.0 achieves a weighted F1 score of .845, accuracy of .846, and an error-corrected kappa of .672 for speaker classification (child vs. teacher). Transcription quality is moderate to high with word error rates of .119 for teachers and .238 for children. WSW2.0 exhibits relatively high absolute agreement intraclass correlations (ICC) with expert transcriptions for a range of classroom language features. These include teacher and child mean utterance length, lexical diversity, question asking, and responses to questions and other utterances, which show absolute agreement intraclass correlations between .64 and .98. To establish scalability, we apply the framework to an extensive dataset spanning two years and over 1,592 hours of classroom audio recordings, demonstrating the framework's robustness for broad real-world applications. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning and natural language processing techniques to revolutionize educational research by providing accurate measures of key features of preschool classroom speech, ultimately guiding more effective intervention strategies and supporting early childhood language development.",

The model was tested under various optimizer settings, such as SGD, Adam, and hybrid configurations, to identify the optimal balance between accuracy, minimization of loss, and computational cost. Results from experiments indicate that DeepSeqCoco can achieve as much as 99.5% accuracy (achieving up to 5% higher accuracy than existing models) with the hybrid SGD-Adam showing the lowest validation loss of 2.81%. It also shows a drop of up to 18% in training time and up to 85% in prediction time for input images. The results point out the promise of the model to improve precision agriculture through an AI-based, scalable, and efficient disease monitoring system.",

We train the agent using domain randomization and evaluate its performance in real-world field tests, assessing its ability to handle unexpected disturbances such as asymmetric drag and an off-center payload. We assess the agent's performance under these perturbations in both simulation and real-world experiments, quantifying performance degradation and benchmarking it against an MPC baseline.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly reshape modern life, advancing fields from healthcare to education and beyond. However, alongside their remarkable capabilities lies a significant threat: the susceptibility of these models to jailbreaking. The fundamental vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks stems from the very data they learn from. As long as this training data includes unfiltered, problematic, or 'dark' content, the models can inherently learn undesirable patterns or weaknesses that allow users to circumvent their intended safety controls. Our research identifies the growing threat posed by dark LLMs models deliberately designed without ethical guardrails or modified through jailbreak techniques. In our research, we uncovered a universal jailbreak attack that effectively compromises multiple state-of-the-art models, enabling them to answer almost any question and produce harmful outputs upon request. The main idea of our attack was published online over seven months ago. However, many of the tested LLMs were still vulnerable to this attack. Despite our responsible disclosure efforts, responses from major LLM providers were often inadequate, highlighting a concerning gap in industry practices regarding AI safety. As model training becomes more accessible and cheaper, and as open-source LLMs proliferate, the risk of widespread misuse escalates. Without decisive intervention, LLMs may continue democratizing access to dangerous knowledge, posing greater risks than anticipated.",

    "summary": "Scrambling quantum systems have been demonstrated as effective substrates for temporal information processing. While their role in providing rich feature maps has been widely studied, a theoretical understanding of their performance in temporal tasks is still lacking. Here we consider a general quantum reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast, the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove exponential memory decays with iterations for local noisy channels. Proving these results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding concentration in temporal quantum learning models.",

    "summary": "Portfolio optimization involves selecting asset weights to minimize a risk-reward objective, such as the portfolio variance in the classical minimum-variance framework. Sparse portfolio selection extends this by imposing a cardinality constraint: only $k$ assets from a universe of $p$ may be included. The standard approach models this problem as a mixed-integer quadratic program and relies on commercial solvers to find the optimal solution. However, the computational costs of such methods increase exponentially with $k$ and $p$, making them too slow for problems of even moderate size. We propose a fast and scalable gradient-based approach that transforms the combinatorial sparse selection problem into a constrained continuous optimization task via Boolean relaxation, while preserving equivalence with the original problem on the set of binary points. Our algorithm employs a tunable parameter that transmutes the auxiliary objective from a convex to a concave function. This allows a stable convex starting point, followed by a controlled path toward a sparse binary solution as the tuning parameter increases and the objective moves toward concavity. In practice, our method matches commercial solvers in asset selection for most instances and, in rare instances, the solution differs by a few assets whilst showing a negligible error in portfolio variance.",

    "summary": "Accurate and robust localization is a critical enabler for emerging 5G and 6G applications, including autonomous driving, extended reality (XR), and smart manufacturing. While data-driven approaches have shown promise, most existing models require large amounts of labeled data and struggle to generalize across deployment scenarios and wireless configurations. To address these limitations, we propose a foundation-model-based solution tailored for wireless localization. We first analyze how different self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks acquire general-purpose and task-specific semantic features based on information bottleneck (IB) theory. Building on this foundation, we design a pretraining methodology for the proposed Large Wireless Localization Model (LWLM). Specifically, we propose an SSL framework that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) spatial-frequency masked channel modeling (SF-MCM), (ii) domain-transformation invariance (DTI), and (iii) position-invariant contrastive learning (PICL). These objectives jointly capture the underlying semantics of wireless channel from multiple perspectives. We further design lightweight decoders for key downstream tasks, including time-of-arrival (ToA) estimation, angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation, single base station (BS) localization, and multiple BS localization. Comprehensive experimental results confirm that LWLM consistently surpasses both model-based and supervised learning baselines across all localization tasks. In particular, LWLM achieves 26.0%--87.5% improvement over transformer models without pretraining, and exhibits strong generalization under label-limited fine-tuning and unseen BS configurations, confirming its potential as a foundation model for wireless localization.",

    "summary": "Boltzmann Generators have emerged as a promising machine learning tool for generating samples from equilibrium distributions of molecular systems using Normalizing Flows and importance weighting. Recently, Flow Matching has helped speed up Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs), scale them to more complex molecular systems, and minimize the length of the flow integration trajectories. We investigate the benefits of using path gradients to fine-tune CNFs initially trained by Flow Matching, in the setting where a target energy is known. Our experiments show that this hybrid approach yields up to a threefold increase in sampling efficiency for molecular systems, all while using the same model, a similar computational budget and without the need for additional sampling. Furthermore, by measuring the length of the flow trajectories during fine-tuning, we show that path gradients largely preserve the learned structure of the flow.",

    "summary": "We introduce the first one-stage Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer framework, which unifies prediction and deferral by learning a shared score-based model that selects the $k$ most cost-effective entities-labels or experts-per input. While existing one-stage L2D methods are limited to deferring to a single expert, our approach jointly optimizes prediction and deferral across multiple entities through a single end-to-end objective. We define a cost-sensitive loss and derive a novel convex surrogate that is independent of the cardinality parameter $k$, enabling generalization across Top-$k$ regimes without retraining. Our formulation recovers the Top-1 deferral policy of prior score-based methods as a special case, and we prove that our surrogate is both Bayes-consistent and $\\mathcal{H}$-consistent under mild assumptions. We further introduce an adaptive variant, Top-$k(x)$, which dynamically selects the number of consulted entities per input to balance predictive accuracy and consultation cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN confirm that our one-stage Top-$k$ method strictly outperforms Top-1 deferral, while Top-$k(x)$ achieves superior accuracy-cost trade-offs by tailoring allocations to input complexity.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in image-based saliency prediction are approaching gold standard performance levels on existing benchmarks. Despite this success, we show that predicting fixations across multiple saliency datasets remains challenging due to dataset bias. We find a significant performance drop (around 40%) when models trained on one dataset are applied to another. Surprisingly, increasing dataset diversity does not resolve this inter-dataset gap, with close to 60% attributed to dataset-specific biases. To address this remaining generalization gap, we propose a novel architecture extending a mostly dataset-agnostic encoder-decoder structure with fewer than 20 dataset-specific parameters that govern interpretable mechanisms such as multi-scale structure, center bias, and fixation spread. Adapting only these parameters to new data accounts for more than 75% of the generalization gap, with a large fraction of the improvement achieved with as few as 50 samples. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art on all three datasets of the MIT/Tuebingen Saliency Benchmark (MIT300, CAT2000, and COCO-Freeview), even when purely generalizing from unrelated datasets, but with a substantial boost when adapting to the respective training datasets. The model also provides valuable insights into spatial saliency properties, revealing complex multi-scale effects that combine both absolute and relative sizes.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant improvements in reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. However, when training reasoning models, these approaches are primarily applicable to specific domains such as mathematics and programming, which imposes fundamental constraints on the breadth and scalability of training data. In contrast, continual pretraining (CPT) offers the advantage of not requiring task-specific signals. Nevertheless, how to effectively synthesize training data for reasoning and how such data affect a wide range of domains remain largely unexplored. This study provides a detailed evaluation of Reasoning CPT, a form of CPT that uses synthetic data to reconstruct the hidden thought processes underlying texts, based on the premise that texts are the result of the author's thinking process. Specifically, we apply Reasoning CPT to Gemma2-9B using synthetic data with hidden thoughts derived from STEM and Law corpora, and compare it to standard CPT on the MMLU benchmark. Our analysis reveals that Reasoning CPT consistently improves performance across all evaluated domains. Notably, reasoning skills acquired in one domain transfer effectively to others; the performance gap with conventional methods widens as problem difficulty increases, with gains of up to 8 points on the most challenging problems. Furthermore, models trained with hidden thoughts learn to adjust the depth of their reasoning according to problem difficulty.",

Eddy-resolving ocean forecasting is providing more reliable protection for fisheries and navigational safety, but also presents significant scientific challenges and high computational costs for traditional numerical models. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather and ocean forecasting systems are becoming powerful tools that balance forecast performance with computational efficiency. However, the complex multiscale features in the ocean dynamical system make AI models still face many challenges in mesoscale eddy forecasting (especially regional modelling). Here, we develop LanTu, a regional eddy-resolving ocean forecasting system based on dynamics-enhanced deep learning. We incorporate cross-scale interactions into LanTu and construct multiscale physical constraint for optimising LanTu guided by knowledge of eddy dynamics in order to improve the forecasting skill of LanTu for mesoscale evolution. The results show that LanTu outperforms the existing advanced operational numerical ocean forecasting system (NOFS) and AI-based ocean forecasting system (AI-OFS) in temperature, salinity, sea level anomaly and current prediction, with a lead time of more than 10 days. Our study highlights that dynamics-enhanced deep learning (LanTu) can be a powerful paradigm for eddy-resolving ocean forecasting.",

    "summary": "Medical image segmentation models are often trained on curated datasets, leading to performance degradation when deployed in real-world clinical settings due to mismatches between training and test distributions. While data augmentation techniques are widely used to address these challenges, traditional visually consistent augmentation strategies lack the robustness needed for diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we systematically evaluate alternative augmentation strategies, focusing on MixUp and Auxiliary Fourier Augmentation. These methods mitigate the effects of multiple variations without explicitly targeting specific sources of distribution shifts. We demonstrate how these techniques significantly improve out-of-distribution generalization and robustness to imaging variations across a wide range of transformations in cardiac cine MRI and prostate MRI segmentation. We quantitatively find that these augmentation methods enhance learned feature representations by promoting separability and compactness. Additionally, we highlight how their integration into nnU-Net training pipelines provides an easy-to-implement, effective solution for enhancing the reliability of medical segmentation models in real-world applications.",

HandReader$_{RGB}$ employs the novel Temporal Shift-Adaptive Module (TSAM) to process RGB features from videos of varying lengths while preserving important sequential information. HandReader$_{KP}$ is built on the proposed Temporal Pose Encoder (TPE) operated on keypoints as tensors. Such keypoints composition in a batch allows the encoder to pass them through 2D and 3D convolution layers, utilizing temporal and spatial information and accumulating keypoints coordinates. We also introduce HandReader_RGB+KP - architecture with a joint encoder to benefit from RGB and keypoint modalities. Each HandReader model possesses distinct advantages and achieves state-of-the-art results on the ChicagoFSWild and ChicagoFSWild+ datasets. Moreover, the models demonstrate high performance on the first open dataset for Russian fingerspelling, Znaki, presented in this paper.

    "summary": "TV customers today face many choices from many live channels and on-demand services. Providing a personalised experience that saves customers time when discovering content is essential for TV providers. However, a reliable understanding of their behaviour and preferences is key. When creating personalised recommendations for TV, the biggest challenge is understanding viewing behaviour within households when multiple people are watching. The objective is to detect and combine individual profiles to make better-personalised recommendations for group viewing. Our challenge is that we have little explicit information about who is watching the devices at any time (individuals or groups). Also, we do not have a way to combine more than one individual profile to make better recommendations for group viewing. We propose a novel framework using a Gaussian mixture model averaging to obtain point estimates for the number of household TV profiles and a Bayesian random walk model to introduce uncertainty. We applied our approach using data from real customers whose TV-watching data totalled approximately half a million observations. Our results indicate that combining our framework with the selected features provides a means to estimate the number of household TV profiles and their characteristics, including shifts over time and quantification of uncertainty.",

In particular, our approach outperforms all other existing 8B or 70B models when trained at those sizes, including models distilled from DeepSeek-R1. J1 also outperforms o1-mini, and even R1 on some benchmarks, despite training a smaller model. We provide analysis and ablations comparing Pairwise-J1 vs Pointwise-J1 models, offline vs online training recipes, reward strategies, seed prompts, and variations in thought length and content.

    "summary": "Agents are minimally entities that are influenced by their past observations and act to influence future observations. This latter capacity is captured by empowerment, which has served as a vital framing concept across artificial intelligence and cognitive science. This former capacity, however, is equally foundational: In what ways, and to what extent, can an agent be influenced by what it observes? In this paper, we ground this concept in a universal agent-centric measure that we refer to as plasticity, and reveal a fundamental connection to empowerment. Following a set of desiderata on a suitable definition, we define plasticity using a new information-theoretic quantity we call the generalized directed information. We show that this new quantity strictly generalizes the directed information introduced by Massey (1990) while preserving all of its desirable properties. Our first finding is that plasticity is the mirror of empowerment: The agent's plasticity is identical to the empowerment of the environment, and vice versa. Our second finding establishes a tension between the plasticity and empowerment of an agent, suggesting that agent design needs to be mindful of both characteristics. We explore the implications of these findings, and suggest that plasticity, empowerment, and their relationship are essential to understanding agency.",

    "summary": "Obtaining accurate probabilistic energy forecasts and making effective decisions amid diverse uncertainties are routine challenges in future energy systems. This paper presents the solution of team GEB, which ranked 3rd in trading, 4th in forecasting, and 1st among student teams in the IEEE Hybrid Energy Forecasting and Trading Competition 2024 (HEFTCom2024). The solution provides accurate probabilistic forecasts for a wind-solar hybrid system, and achieves substantial trading revenue in the day-ahead electricity market. Key components include: (1) a stacking-based approach combining sister forecasts from various Numerical Weather Predictions (NWPs) to provide wind power forecasts, (2) an online solar post-processing model to address the distribution shift in the online test set caused by increased solar capacity, (3) a probabilistic aggregation method for accurate quantile forecasts of hybrid generation, and (4) a stochastic trading strategy to maximize expected trading revenue considering uncertainties in electricity prices. This paper also explores the potential of end-to-end learning to further enhance the trading revenue by adjusting the distribution of forecast errors. Detailed case studies are provided to validate the effectiveness of these proposed methods. Code for all mentioned methods is available for reproduction and further research in both industry and academia.",

    "summary": "The Spiking Neural Network (SNN) has drawn increasing attention for its energy-efficient, event-driven processing and biological plausibility. To train SNNs via backpropagation, surrogate gradients are used to approximate the non-differentiable spike function, but they only maintain nonzero derivatives within a narrow range of membrane potentials near the firing threshold, referred to as the surrogate gradient support width gamma. We identify a major challenge, termed the dilemma of gamma: a relatively large gamma leads to overactivation, characterized by excessive neuron firing, which in turn increases energy consumption, whereas a small gamma causes vanishing gradients and weakens temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose a temporal Inhibitory Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ILIF) neuron model, inspired by biological inhibitory mechanisms. This model incorporates interconnected inhibitory units for membrane potential and current, effectively mitigating overactivation while preserving gradient propagation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates ILIF effectiveness in overcoming the gamma dilemma, and extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that ILIF improves energy efficiency by reducing firing rates, stabilizes training, and enhances accuracy.

    "summary": "Software vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and SQL injections are a major source of security breaches. Traditional methods for vulnerability detection remain essential but are limited by high false positive rates, scalability issues, and reliance on manual effort. These constraints have driven interest in AI-based approaches to automated vulnerability detection and secure code generation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for classification tasks, their complexity and opacity pose challenges for interpretability and deployment. Sparse Autoencoder offer a promising solution to this problem. We explore whether SAEs can serve as a lightweight, interpretable alternative for bug detection in Java functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of SAEs when applied to representations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2B, examining their capacity to highlight buggy behaviour without fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. We found that SAE-derived features enable bug detection with an F1 score of up to 89%, consistently outperforming fine-tuned transformer encoder baselines. Our work provides the first empirical evidence that SAEs can be used to detect software bugs directly from the internal representations of pretrained LLMs, without any fine-tuning or task-specific supervision.",

Existing path planning methods for auxiliary cameras track two-dimensional surgical features but do not simultaneously account for camera orientation, workspace constraints, and robot joint limits. This study presents AutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve visualization in RAMIS. Implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, the system uses a priority-based, workspace-constrained control algorithm that combines heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained 99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\\pm$ 2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study (N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new multi-camera visualization methods in RAMIS.",

Current explanation evaluation frameworks measure quality by comparing against ideal \"ground-truth\" explanations, or by verifying model sensitivity to important inputs.

We propose a ground-truth Agnostic eXplanation Evaluation framework (AXE) for evaluating and comparing model explanations that satisfies these principles. Unlike prior approaches, AXE does not require access to ideal ground-truth explanations for comparison, or rely on model sensitivity - providing an independent measure of explanation quality.

    "summary": "With the advent of neural language models, the performance of code generation has been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions, thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the best-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of generated code.",

    "summary": "Generative semantic communication (Gen-SemCom) with large artificial intelligence (AI) model promises a transformative paradigm for 6G networks, which reduces communication costs by transmitting low-dimensional prompts rather than raw data. However, purely prompt-driven generation loses fine-grained visual details. Additionally, there is a lack of systematic metrics to evaluate the performance of Gen-SemCom systems. To address these issues, we develop a hybrid Gen-SemCom system with a critical information embedding (CIE) framework, where both text prompts and semantically critical features are extracted for transmissions. First, a novel approach of semantic filtering is proposed to select and transmit the semantically critical features of images relevant to semantic label. By integrating the text prompt and critical features, the receiver reconstructs high-fidelity images using a diffusion-based generative model. Next, we propose the generative visual information fidelity (GVIF) metric to evaluate the visual quality of the generated image. By characterizing the statistical models of image features, the GVIF metric quantifies the mutual information between the distorted features and their original counterparts. By maximizing the GVIF metric, we design a channel-adaptive Gen-SemCom system that adaptively control the volume of features and compression rate according to the channel state. Experimental results validate the GVIF metric's sensitivity to visual fidelity, correlating with both the PSNR and critical information volume. In addition, the optimized system achieves superior performance over benchmarking schemes in terms of higher PSNR and lower FID scores.",

Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables (such as spatiotemporal correlation functions). It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. It may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different kinds of interactions, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a thermodynamic uncertainty relation. We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.",

We explore several sampling algorithms that make use of subset evaluations to reduce computational overhead. We adapt the subset samplers for this setting where gradient information is not available or is unreliable. To achieve this, we introduce data-driven proxies in place of Taylor expansions and define a novel computation-cost aware adaptive controller. We undertake an extensive evaluation for a challenging disease modelling task and a configurable task with similar irregularity in the likelihood surface. We find our improved version of Hierarchical Importance with Nested Training Samples (HINTS), with adaptive proposals and a data-driven proxy, obtains the best sampling error in a fixed computational budget. We conclude that subset evaluations can provide cheap and naturally-tempered exploration, while a data-driven proxy can pre-screen proposals successfully in explored regions of the state space. These two elements combine through hierarchical delayed acceptance to achieve efficient, exact sampling.",

Traditional annealing methods require temperature schedules and hyperparameter tuning, falling short of the goal of truly black-box variational inference. We introduce FlowVAT, a conditional tempering approach for normalizing flow variational inference that addresses these limitations. Our method tempers both the base and target distributions simultaneously, maintaining affine-invariance under tempering. By conditioning the normalizing flow on temperature, we leverage overparameterized neural networks' generalization capabilities to train a single flow representing the posterior across a range of temperatures. This preserves modes identified at higher temperatures when sampling from the variational posterior at $T = 1$, mitigating standard variational methods' mode-seeking behavior. In experiments with 2, 10, and 20 dimensional multi-modal distributions, FlowVAT outperforms traditional and adaptive annealing methods, finding more modes and achieving better ELBO values, particularly in higher dimensions where existing approaches fail. Our method requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and does not require an annealing schedule, advancing toward fully-automatic black-box variational inference for complicated posteriors.",

Unlike prior work relying on parametric or binning-based estimators, BaNk-UCB uses local geometry to estimate rewards and adaptively balances exploration and exploitation. We provide near-optimal regret guarantees under standard Lipschitz smoothness and margin assumptions, using a theoretically motivated batch schedule that balances regret across batches and achieves minimax-optimal rates. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BaNk-UCB consistently outperforms binning-based baselines.",

    "summary": "Modal synthesis methods are a long-standing approach for modelling distributed musical systems. In some cases extensions are possible in order to handle geometric nonlinearities. One such case is the high-amplitude vibration of a string, where geometric nonlinear effects lead to perceptually important effects including pitch glides and a dependence of brightness on striking amplitude. A modal decomposition leads to a coupled nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations. Recent work in applied machine learning approaches (in particular neural ordinary differential equations) has been used to model lumped dynamic systems such as electronic circuits automatically from data. In this work, we examine how modal decomposition can be combined with neural ordinary differential equations for modelling distributed musical systems. The proposed model leverages the analytical solution for linear vibration of system's modes and employs a neural network to account for nonlinear dynamic behaviour. Physical parameters of a system remain easily accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the network architecture. As an initial proof of concept, we generate synthetic data for a nonlinear transverse string and show that the model can be trained to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system.

Compared to existing methods, MuToR offers several key advantages: it introduces only a negligible number of additional parameters, requires no architectural changes--ensuring compatibility with off-the-shelf pretrained language models--and remains aligned with the next-token pretraining objective, making it especially well-suited for supervised fine-tuning. Moreover, it naturally supports scalable prediction horizons. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of MuToR across a range of use cases, including supervised fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and pretraining, on challenging generative tasks in both language and vision domains.

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in robotic manipulation but faces challenges in sample inefficiency and lack of interpretability, limiting its applicability in real world scenarios. Enabling the agent to gain a deeper understanding and adapt more efficiently to diverse working scenarios is crucial, and strategic knowledge utilization is a key factor in this process. This paper proposes a Knowledge Capture, Adaptation, and Composition (KCAC) framework to systematically integrate knowledge transfer into RL through cross-task curriculum learning. KCAC is evaluated using a two block stacking task in the CausalWorld benchmark, a complex robotic manipulation environment. To our knowledge, existing RL approaches fail to solve this task effectively, reflecting deficiencies in knowledge capture. In this work, we redesign the benchmark reward function by removing rigid constraints and strict ordering, allowing the agent to maximize total rewards concurrently and enabling flexible task completion. Furthermore, we define two self-designed sub-tasks and implement a structured cross-task curriculum to facilitate efficient learning. As a result, our KCAC approach achieves a 40 percent reduction in training time while improving task success rates by 10 percent compared to traditional RL methods. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key curriculum design parameters subtask selection, transition timing, and learning rate that optimize learning efficiency and provide conceptual guidance for curriculum based RL frameworks. This work offers valuable insights into curriculum design in RL and robotic learning.",

    "summary": "Large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved high performance in vision-language tasks involving single image but they struggle when presented with a collection of multiple images (Multiple Image Question Answering scenario). These tasks, which involve reasoning over large number of images, present issues in scalability (with increasing number of images) and retrieval performance. In this work, we propose an enhancement for retriever framework introduced in MIRAGE model using submodular subset selection techniques. Our method leverages query-aware submodular functions, such as GraphCut, to pre-select a subset of semantically relevant images before main retrieval component. We demonstrate that using anchor-based queries and augmenting the data improves submodular-retriever pipeline effectiveness, particularly in large haystack sizes.",

    "summary": "Traffic congestion has significant impacts on both the economy and the environment. Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) have long been the standard for evaluating traffic intersections' level of service and operational efficiency. However, the scarcity of traditional high-resolution loop detector data (ATSPM) presents challenges in accurately measuring MOEs or capturing the intricate spatiotemporal characteristics inherent in urban intersection traffic. To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive intersection traffic flow simulation that utilizes a multi-task learning paradigm. This approach combines graph convolutions for primary estimating lane-wise exit and inflow with time series convolutions for secondary assessing multi-directional queue lengths and travel time distribution through any arbitrary urban traffic intersection. Compared to existing deep learning methodologies, the proposed Multi-Task Deep Learning Digital Twin (MTDT) distinguishes itself through its adaptability to local temporal and spatial features, such as signal timing plans, intersection topology, driving behaviors, and turning movement counts. We also show the benefit of multi-task learning in the effectiveness of individual traffic simulation tasks. Furthermore, our approach facilitates sequential computation and provides complete parallelization through GPU implementation. This not only streamlines the computational process but also enhances scalability and performance.",

    "summary": "Searching through chemical space is an exceptionally challenging problem because the number of possible molecules grows combinatorially with the number of atoms. Large, autoregressive models trained on databases of chemical compounds have yielded powerful generators, but we still lack robust strategies for generating molecules with desired properties. This molecular search problem closely resembles the \"alignment\" problem for large language models, though for many chemical tasks we have a specific and easily evaluable reward function. Here, we introduce an algorithm called energy rank alignment (ERA) that leverages an explicit reward function to produce a gradient-based objective that we use to optimize autoregressive policies. We show theoretically that this algorithm is closely related to proximal policy optimization (PPO) and direct preference optimization (DPO), but has a minimizer that converges to an ideal Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution with the reward playing the role of an energy function. Furthermore, this algorithm is highly scalable, does not require reinforcement learning, and performs well relative to DPO when the number of preference observations per pairing is small. We deploy this approach to align molecular transformers and protein language models to generate molecules and protein sequences, respectively, with externally specified properties and find that it does so robustly, searching through diverse parts of chemical space.",

The survey has two parts. The first considers incorporating physics knowledge on an architectural level through objective functions, structured predictive models, and data augmentation. The second considers data as physics knowledge, which motivates looking at multi-task, meta, and contextual learning as an alternative approach to incorporating physics knowledge in a data-driven fashion.

    "summary": "Space-ground integrated networks hold great promise for providing global connectivity, particularly in remote areas where large amounts of valuable data are generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, but lacking terrestrial communication infrastructure. The massive data is conventionally transferred to the cloud server for centralized artificial intelligence (AI) models training, raising huge communication overhead and privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a hierarchical learning and computing framework, which leverages the lowlatency characteristic of low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites and the global coverage of geostationary-earth-orbit (GEO) satellites, to provide global aggregation services for locally trained models on ground IoT devices. Due to the time-varying nature of satellite network topology and the energy constraints of LEO satellites, efficiently aggregating the received local models from ground devices on LEO satellites is highly challenging. By leveraging the predictability of inter-satellite connectivity, modeling the space network as a directed graph, we formulate a network energy minimization problem for model aggregation, which turns out to be a Directed Steiner Tree (DST) problem. We propose a topologyaware energy-efficient routing (TAEER) algorithm to solve the DST problem by finding a minimum spanning arborescence on a substitute directed graph. Extensive simulations under realworld space-ground integrated network settings demonstrate that the proposed TAEER algorithm significantly reduces energy consumption and outperforms benchmarks.",

    "summary": "Q-learning is a widely used algorithm in reinforcement learning (RL), but its convergence can be slow, especially when the discount factor is close to one. Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) Q-learning, which introduces a relaxation factor to speed up convergence, addresses this issue but has two major limitations: In the tabular setting, the relaxation parameter depends on transition probability, making it not entirely model-free, and it suffers from overestimation bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a sample-based, model-free double SOR Q-learning algorithm. Theoretically and empirically, this algorithm is shown to be less biased than SOR Q-learning. Further, in the tabular setting, the convergence analysis under boundedness assumptions on iterates is discussed. The proposed algorithm is extended to large-scale problems using deep RL. Finally, the tabular version of the proposed algorithm is compared using roulette and grid world environments, while the deep RL version is tested on a maximization bias example and OpenAI Gym environments.",

    "summary": "Graph domain adaptation has recently enabled knowledge transfer across different graphs. However, without the semantic information on target graphs, the performance on target graphs is still far from satisfactory. To address the issue, we study the problem of active graph domain adaptation, which selects a small quantitative of informative nodes on the target graph for extra annotation. This problem is highly challenging due to the complicated topological relationships and the distribution discrepancy across graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Dual Consistency Delving with Topological Uncertainty (DELTA) for active graph domain adaptation. Our DELTA consists of an edge-oriented graph subnetwork and a path-oriented graph subnetwork, which can explore topological semantics from complementary perspectives. In particular, our edge-oriented graph subnetwork utilizes the message passing mechanism to learn neighborhood information, while our path-oriented graph subnetwork explores high-order relationships from sub-structures. To jointly learn from two subnetworks, we roughly select informative candidate nodes with the consideration of consistency across two subnetworks. Then, we aggregate local semantics from its K-hop subgraph based on node degrees for topological uncertainty estimation. To overcome potential distribution shifts, we compare target nodes and their corresponding source nodes for discrepancy scores as an additional component for fine selection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DELTA outperforms various state-of-the-art approaches. The code implementation of DELTA is available at this https URL.",

It is an essential part of deep graph representation learning and is indispensable in graph-level tasks like classification or regression. Current approaches pool hierarchical structures in graphs by iteratively applying shallow pooling operators up to a fixed depth. However, they disregard the interdependencies between structures at different hierarchical levels and do not adapt to datasets that contain graphs with different sizes that may require pooling with various depths. To address these issues, we propose MDL-Pool, a pooling operator based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle, whose loss formulation explicitly models the interdependencies between different hierarchical levels and facilitates a direct comparison between multiple pooling alternatives with different depths. MDP-Pool builds on the map equation, an information-theoretic objective function for community detection, which naturally implements Occam's razor and balances between model complexity and goodness-of-fit via the MDL. We demonstrate MDL-Pool's competitive performance in an empirical evaluation against various baselines across standard graph classification datasets.",

    "summary": "Non-stationarity poses significant challenges for multivariate time series forecasting due to the inherent short-term fluctuations and long-term trends that can lead to spurious regressions or obscure essential long-term relationships. Most existing methods either eliminate or retain non-stationarity without adequately addressing its distinct impacts on short-term and long-term modeling. Eliminating non-stationarity is essential for avoiding spurious regressions and capturing local dependencies in short-term modeling, while preserving it is crucial for revealing long-term cointegration across variates. In this paper, we propose TimeBridge, a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between non-stationarity and dependency modeling in long-term time series forecasting. By segmenting input series into smaller patches, TimeBridge applies Integrated Attention to mitigate short-term non-stationarity and capture stable dependencies within each variate, while Cointegrated Attention preserves non-stationarity to model long-term cointegration across variates. Extensive experiments show that TimeBridge consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting. Additionally, TimeBridge demonstrates exceptional performance in financial forecasting on the CSI 500 and S&P 500 indices, further validating its robustness and effectiveness.

    "summary": "Machine Learning models in real-world applications must continuously learn new tasks to adapt to shifts in the data-generating distribution. Yet, for Continual Learning (CL), models often struggle to balance learning new tasks (plasticity) with retaining previous knowledge (memory stability). Consequently, they are susceptible to Catastrophic Forgetting, which degrades performance and undermines the reliability of deployed systems. In the Bayesian CL literature, variational methods tackle this challenge by employing a learning objective that recursively updates the posterior distribution while constraining it to stay close to its previous estimate. Nonetheless, we argue that these methods may be ineffective due to compounding approximation errors over successive recursions. To mitigate this, we propose new learning objectives that integrate the regularization effects of multiple previous posterior estimations, preventing individual errors from dominating future posterior updates and compounding over time. We reveal insightful connections between these objectives and Temporal-Difference methods, a popular learning mechanism in Reinforcement Learning and Neuroscience. Experiments on challenging CL benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates Catastrophic Forgetting, outperforming strong Variational CL methods.",

However, current models often require extra fine-tuning to apply their learned structural and semantic representations to new graphs, which limits their versatility. Recent breakthroughs in zero-shot inductive reasoning on knowledge graphs (KGs), offer us a new perspective on extending KG reasoning to general graph applications. In this paper, we introduce SCR, a unified graph reasoning framework designed to train on knowledge graphs and effectively generalize across a wide range of graph tasks and domains. We begin by designing the task-specific KG structures to establish a unified topology for different task formats. Then we propose semantic-conditioned message passing, a novel mechanism addressing the inherent semantic isolation in traditional KG reasoning, by jointly modeling structural and semantic invariance patterns in graph representations. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we evaluate the inductive reasoning capability of SCR using 38 diverse graph datasets, covering node-level, link-level, and graph-level tasks across multiple domains. Our results show substantial performance gains over existing foundation models and supervised baselines, highlighting the efficacy and adaptability of our approach.",

    "summary": "Time series anomaly detection aims to identify unusual patterns in data or deviations from systems' expected behavior. The reconstruction-based methods are the mainstream in this task, which learn point-wise representation via unsupervised learning. However, the unlabeled anomaly points in training data may cause these reconstruction-based methods to learn and reconstruct anomalous data, resulting in the challenge of capturing normal patterns. In this paper, we propose a time series anomaly detection method based on implicit neural representation (INR) reconstruction, named TSINR, to address this challenge. Due to the property of spectral bias, TSINR enables prioritizing low-frequency signals and exhibiting poorer performance on high-frequency abnormal data. Specifically, we adopt INR to parameterize time series data as a continuous function and employ a transformer-based architecture to predict the INR of given data. As a result, the proposed TSINR method achieves the advantage of capturing the temporal continuity and thus is more sensitive to discontinuous anomaly data. In addition, we further design a novel form of INR continuous function to learn inter- and intra-channel information, and leverage a pre-trained large language model to amplify the intense fluctuations in anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSINR achieves superior overall performance on both univariate and multivariate time series anomaly detection benchmarks compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

    "summary": "Adversarial examples usually exhibit good cross-model transferability, enabling attacks on black-box models with limited information about their architectures and parameters, which are highly threatening in commercial black-box scenarios. Model ensembling is an effective strategy to improve the transferability of adversarial examples by attacking multiple surrogate models. However, since prior studies usually adopt few models in the ensemble, there remains an open question of whether scaling the number of models can further improve black-box attacks. Inspired by the scaling law of large foundation models, we investigate the scaling laws of black-box adversarial attacks in this work. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations, we conclude with clear scaling laws that using more surrogate models enhances adversarial transferability. Comprehensive experiments verify the claims on standard image classifiers, diverse defended models and multimodal large language models using various adversarial attack methods. Specifically, by scaling law, we achieve 90%+ transfer attack success rate on even proprietary models like GPT-4o. Further visualization indicates that there is also a scaling law on the interpretability and semantics of adversarial perturbations.",

    "summary": "The advent of 6G/NextG networks comes along with a series of benefits, including extreme capacity, reliability, and efficiency. However, these networks may become vulnerable to new security threats. Therefore, 6G/NextG networks must be equipped with advanced Artificial Intelligence algorithms, in order to evade these attacks. Existing studies on the intrusion detection task rely on the train of shallow machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and so on, yielding suboptimal performance. Others are based on deep neural networks consisting of static components, which are not conditional on the input. This limits their representation power and efficiency. To resolve these issues, we present the first study integrating Mixture of Experts (MoE) for identifying malicious traffic. Specifically, we use network traffic data and convert the 1D array of features into a 2D matrix. Next, we pass this matrix through convolutional neural network (CNN) layers followed by batch normalization and max pooling layers. After obtaining the representation vector via the CNN layers, a sparsely gated MoE layer is used. This layer consists of a set of experts (dense layers) and a router, where the router assigns weights to the output of each expert. Sparsity is achieved by choosing the most relevant experts of the total ones. Finally, we perform a series of ablation experiments to prove the effectiveness of our proposed model. Experiments are conducted on the 5G-NIDD dataset, a network intrusion detection dataset generated from a real 5G test network. Results show that our introduced approach reaches weighted F1-score up to 99.95% achieving comparable performance to existing approaches. Findings also show that our proposed model achieves multiple advantages over state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "summary": "Multi-objective learning endeavors to concurrently optimize multiple objectives using a single model, aiming to achieve high and balanced performance across diverse objectives. However, this often entails a more complex optimization problem, particularly when navigating potential conflicts between objectives, leading to solutions with higher memory requirements and computational complexity. This paper introduces a Multi-Objective Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning (MOGCSL) framework for automatically learning to achieve multiple objectives from offline sequential data. MOGCSL extends the conventional GCSL method to multi-objective scenarios by redefining goals from one-dimensional scalars to multi-dimensional vectors. It benefits from naturally eliminating the need for complex architectures and optimization constraints. Moreover, MOGCSL effectively filters out uninformative or noisy instances that fail to achieve desirable long-term rewards across multiple objectives. We also introduces a novel goal-selection algorithm for MOGCSL to model and identify \"high\" achievable goals for inference.\nWhile MOGCSL is quite general, we focus on its application to the next action prediction problem in commercial-grade recommender systems. In this context, any viable solution needs to be reasonably scalable and also be robust to large amounts of noisy data that is characteristic of this application space. We show that MOGCSL performs admirably on both counts by extensive experiments on real-world recommendation datasets. Also, analysis and experiments are included to explain its strength in discounting the noisier portions of training data in recommender systems with multiple objectives.",

    "summary": "Continual Federated Learning (CFL) allows distributed devices to collaboratively learn novel concepts from continuously shifting training data while avoiding knowledge forgetting of previously seen tasks. To tackle this challenge, most current CFL approaches rely on extensive rehearsal of previous data. Despite effectiveness, rehearsal comes at a cost to memory, and it may also violate data privacy. Considering these, we seek to apply regularization techniques to CFL by considering their cost-efficient properties that do not require sample caching or rehearsal. Specifically, we first apply traditional regularization techniques to CFL and observe that existing regularization techniques, especially synaptic intelligence, can achieve promising results under homogeneous data distribution but fail when the data is heterogeneous. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective regularization algorithm for CFL named FedSSI, which tailors the synaptic intelligence for the CFL with heterogeneous data settings. FedSSI can not only reduce computational overhead without rehearsal but also address the data heterogeneity issue. Extensive experiments show that FedSSI achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "summary": "Organizations are collecting vast amounts of data, but they often lack the capabilities needed to fully extract insights. As a result, they increasingly share data with external experts, such as analysts or researchers, to gain value from it. However, this practice introduces significant privacy risks. Various techniques have been proposed to address privacy concerns in data sharing. However, these methods often degrade data utility, impacting the performance of machine learning (ML) models. Our research identifies key limitations in existing optimization models for privacy preservation, particularly in handling categorical variables, and evaluating effectiveness across diverse datasets. We propose a novel multi-objective optimization model that simultaneously minimizes information loss and maximizes protection against attacks. This model is empirically validated using diverse datasets and compared with two existing algorithms. We assess information loss, the number of individuals subject to linkage or homogeneity attacks, and ML performance after anonymization. The results indicate that our model achieves lower information loss and more effectively mitigates the risk of attacks, reducing the number of individuals susceptible to these attacks compared to alternative algorithms in some cases. Additionally, our model maintains comparable ML performance relative to the original data or data anonymized by other methods. Our findings highlight significant improvements in privacy protection and ML model performance, offering a comprehensive and extensible framework for balancing privacy and utility in data sharing.",

We highlight two key contributions: (a) Theoretically, for the first time, we prove that enhancing the policy robustness to irrelevant features leads to improved generalization performance. (b) Empirically, we demonstrate that mutual distillation between policies contributes to such robustness, enabling the spontaneous emergence of invariant representations over pixel inputs. Overall, our findings challenge the conventional view of distillation as merely a means of knowledge transfer, offering a novel perspective on the generalization in deep reinforcement learning.",

    "summary": "The selection of hyperparameters, such as prompt templates in large language models (LLMs), must often strike a balance between reliability and cost. In many cases, structural relationships between the expected reliability levels of the hyperparameters can be inferred from prior information and held-out data -- e.g., longer prompt templates may be more detailed and thus more reliable. However, existing hyperparameter selection methods either do not provide formal reliability guarantees or are unable to incorporate structured knowledge in the hyperparameter space. This paper introduces reliability graph-based Pareto testing (RG-PT), a novel multi-objective hyperparameter selection framework that maintains formal reliability guarantees in terms of false discovery rate (FDR), while accounting for known relationships among hyperparameters via a directed acyclic graph. Edges in the graph reflect expected reliability and cost trade-offs among hyperparameters, which are inferred via the Bradley-Terry (BT) ranking model from prior information and held-out data. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that RG-PT significantly outperforms existing methods such as learn-then-test (LTT) and Pareto testing (PT) through a more efficient exploration of the hyperparameter space.",

    "summary": "We introduce sliced optimal transport dataset distance (s-OTDD), a model-agnostic, embedding-agnostic approach for dataset comparison that requires no training, is robust to variations in the number of classes, and can handle disjoint label sets. The core innovation is Moment Transform Projection (MTP), which maps a label, represented as a distribution over features, to a real number. Using MTP, we derive a data point projection that transforms datasets into one-dimensional distributions. The s-OTDD is defined as the expected Wasserstein distance between the projected distributions, with respect to random projection parameters. Leveraging the closed form solution of one-dimensional optimal transport, s-OTDD achieves (near-)linear computational complexity in the number of data points and feature dimensions and is independent of the number of classes. With its geometrically meaningful projection, s-OTDD strongly correlates with the optimal transport dataset distance while being more efficient than existing dataset discrepancy measures. Moreover, it correlates well with the performance gap in transfer learning and classification accuracy in data augmentation.",

    "summary": "The application of deep learning for partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained control is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods rarely consider safety requirements crucial in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we propose Safe Diffusion Models for PDE Control (SafeDiffCon), which introduce the uncertainty quantile as model uncertainty quantification to achieve optimal control under safety constraints through both post-training and inference phases. Firstly, our approach post-trains a pre-trained diffusion model to generate control sequences that better satisfy safety constraints while achieving improved control objectives via a reweighted diffusion loss, which incorporates the uncertainty quantile estimated using conformal prediction. Secondly, during inference, the diffusion model dynamically adjusts both its generation process and parameters through iterative guidance and fine-tuning, conditioned on control targets while simultaneously integrating the estimated uncertainty quantile. We evaluate SafeDiffCon on three control tasks: 1D Burgers' equation, 2D incompressible fluid, and controlled nuclear fusion problem. Results demonstrate that SafeDiffCon is the only method that satisfies all safety constraints, whereas other classical and deep learning baselines fail. Furthermore, while adhering to safety constraints, SafeDiffCon achieves the best control performance.",

    "summary": "We study the theoretical foundations of composition in diffusion models, with a particular focus on out-of-distribution extrapolation and length-generalization. Prior work has shown that composing distributions via linear score combination can achieve promising results, including length-generalization in some cases (Du et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022). However, our theoretical understanding of how and why such compositions work remains incomplete. In fact, it is not even entirely clear what it means for composition to \"work\". This paper starts to address these fundamental gaps. We begin by precisely defining one possible desired result of composition, which we call projective composition. Then, we investigate: (1) when linear score combinations provably achieve projective composition, (2) whether reverse-diffusion sampling can generate the desired composition, and (3) the conditions under which composition fails. We connect our theoretical analysis to prior empirical observations where composition has either worked or failed, for reasons that were unclear at the time. Finally, we propose a simple heuristic to help predict the success or failure of new compositions.",

    "summary": "Graph neural networks are gaining attention in fifth-generation (5G) core network digital twins, which are data-driven complex systems with numerous components. Analyzing these data can be challenging due to rare failure types, leading to imbalanced classification in multiclass settings. Digital twins of 5G networks increasingly employ graph classification as the main method for identifying failure types. However, the skewed distribution of failure occurrences is a significant class-imbalance problem that prevents practical graph data mining. Previous studies have not sufficiently addressed this complex problem. This paper, proposes class-Fourier GNN (CF-GNN) that introduces a class-oriented spectral filtering mechanism to ensure precise classification by estimating a unique spectral filter for each class. This work employs eigenvalue and eigenvector spectral filtering to capture and adapt to variations in minority classes, ensuring accurate class-specific feature discrimination, and adept at graph representation learning for complex local structures among neighbors in an end-to-end setting. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CF-GNN could help create new techniques for enhancing classifiers and investigate the characteristics of the multiclass imbalanced data in a network digital twin system.",

This paper introduces Ranking to Variable Fusion (R2VF), a two-step method designed to efficiently fuse nominal and ordinal categories in GLMs. By first transforming nominal features into an ordinal framework via regularized regression and then applying variable fusion, R2VF strikes a balance between model complexity and interpretability.

Our approach combines classical integration-by-parts techniques with modern stochastic analysis tools, such as Bismut's formula and Malliavin calculus, and it works for both linear and nonlinear SDEs. In doing so, we establish a rigorous connection between the Malliavin derivative, its adjoint, the Malliavin divergence (Skorokhod integral), and diffusion generative models, thereby providing a systematic method for computing $\\nabla \\log p_t(x)$. In the linear case, we present a detailed analysis showing that our formula coincides with the analytical score function derived from the solution of the Fokker--Planck equation. For nonlinear SDEs with state-independent diffusion coefficients, we derive a closed-form expression for $\\nabla \\log p_t(x)$. We evaluate the proposed framework across multiple generative tasks and find that its performance is comparable to state-of-the-art methods. These results can be generalised to broader classes of SDEs, paving the way for new score-based diffusion generative models.",

    "summary": "Causal discovery aims to extract qualitative causal knowledge in the form of causal graphs from data. Because causal ground truth is rarely known in the real world, simulated data plays a vital role in evaluating the performance of the various causal discovery algorithms proposed in the literature. But recent work highlighted certain artifacts of commonly used data generation techniques for a standard class of structural causal models (SCM) that may be nonphysical, including var- and R2-sortability, where the variables' variance and coefficients of determination (R2) after regressing on all other variables, respectively, increase along the causal order. Some causal methods exploit such artifacts, leading to unrealistic expectations for their performance on real-world data. Some modifications have been proposed to remove these artifacts; notably, the internally-standardized structural causal model (iSCM) avoids varsortability and largely alleviates R2-sortability on sparse causal graphs, but exhibits a reversed R2-sortability pattern for denser graphs not featured in their work. We analyze which sortability patterns we expect to see in real data, and propose a method for drawing coefficients that we argue more effectively samples the space of SCMs. Finally, we propose a novel extension of our SCM generation method to the time series setting.",

    "summary": "Log data provides crucial insights for tasks like monitoring, root cause analysis, and anomaly detection. Due to the vast volume of logs, automated log parsing is essential to transform semi-structured log messages into structured representations. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have introduced the new research field of LLM-based log parsing. Despite promising results, there is no structured overview of the approaches in this relatively new research field with the earliest advances published in late 2023. This work systematically reviews 29 LLM-based log parsing methods. We benchmark seven of them on public datasets and critically assess their comparability and the reproducibility of their reported results. Our findings summarize the advances of this new research field, with insights on how to report results, which data sets, metrics and which terminology to use, and which inconsistencies to avoid, with code and results made publicly available for transparency.",

    "summary": "Graph Edit Distance (GED) offers a principled and flexible measure of graph similarity, as it quantifies the minimum cost needed to transform one graph into another with customizable edit operation costs. Despite recent learning-based efforts to approximate GED via vector space representations, existing methods struggle with adapting to varying operation costs. Furthermore, they suffer from inefficient, reactive mapping refinements due to reliance on isolated node-level distance as guidance. To address these issues, we propose GEN, a novel learning-based approach for flexible GED approximation. GEN addresses the varying costs adaptation by integrating operation costs prior to match establishment, enabling mappings to dynamically adapt to cost variations. Furthermore, GEN introduces a proactive guidance optimization strategy that captures graph-level dependencies between matches, allowing informed matching decisions in a single step without costly iterative refinements. Extensive evaluations on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GEN achieves up to 37.8% reduction in GED approximation error and 72.7% reduction in inference time compared with state-of-the-art methods, while consistently maintaining robustness under diverse cost settings and graph sizes.",

    "summary": "The primary goal of my Ph.D. study is to develop provably efficient and practical algorithms for data-driven sequential decision-making under uncertainty. My work focuses on reinforcement learning (RL), multi-armed bandits, and their applications, including recommendation systems, computer networks, video analytics, and large language models (LLMs). Sequential decision-making methods, such as bandits and RL, have demonstrated remarkable success - ranging from outperforming human players in complex games like Atari and Go to advancing robotics, recommendation systems, and fine-tuning LLMs. Despite these successes, many established algorithms rely on idealized models that can fail under model misspecifications or adversarial perturbations, particularly in settings where accurate prior knowledge of the underlying model class is unavailable or where malicious users operate within dynamic systems. These challenges are pervasive in real-world applications, where robust and adaptive solutions are critical. Furthermore, while worst-case guarantees provide theoretical reliability, they often fail to capture instance-dependent performance, which can lead to more efficient and practical solutions. Another key challenge lies in generalizing to new, unseen environments, a crucial requirement for deploying these methods in dynamic and unpredictable settings. To address these limitations, my research aims to develop more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable sequential decision-making algorithms for both reinforcement learning and bandits. Towards this end, I focus on developing more efficient, robust, instance-adaptive, and generalizable for both general reinforcement learning (RL) and bandits.",

    "summary": "Although existing Learning-to-Defer (L2D) frameworks support multiple experts, they allocate each query to a single expert, limiting their ability to leverage collective expertise in complex decision-making scenarios. To address this, we introduce the first framework for Top-$k$ Learning-to-Defer, enabling systems to defer each query to the $k$ most cost-effective experts. Our formulation strictly generalizes classical two-stage L2D by supporting multi-expert deferral-a capability absent in prior work. We further propose Top-$k(x)$ Learning-to-Defer, an adaptive extension that learns the optimal number of experts per query based on input complexity, expert quality, and consultation cost. We introduce a novel surrogate loss that is Bayes-consistent, $(\\mathcal{R}, \\mathcal{G})$-consistent, and independent of the cardinality parameter $k$, enabling efficient reuse across different values of $k$. We show that classical model cascades arise as a special case of our method, situating our framework as a strict generalization of both selective deferral and cascaded inference. Experiments on classification and regression demonstrate that Top-$k$ and Top-$k(x)$ yield improved accuracy--cost trade-offs, establishing a new direction for multi-expert deferral in Learning-to-Defer.",

Existing deep learning models often lack spatial generalizability, rely on complex architectures, and struggle with real-time deployment. To address these limitations, we propose the Temporal Graph-based Digital Twin (TGDT), a scalable framework that integrates Temporal Convolutional Networks and Attentional Graph Neural Networks for dynamic, direction-aware traffic modeling and assessment at urban corridors. TGDT estimates key Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) for traffic flow optimization at both the intersection level (e.g., queue length, waiting time) and the corridor level (e.g., traffic volume, travel time). Its modular architecture and sequential optimization scheme enable easy extension to any number of intersections and MOEs. The model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by accurately producing high-dimensional, concurrent multi-output estimates. It also demonstrates high robustness and accuracy across diverse traffic conditions, including extreme scenarios, while relying on only a minimal set of traffic features. Fully parallelized, TGDT can simulate over a thousand scenarios within a matter of seconds, offering a cost-effective, interpretable, and real-time solution for urban traffic management and optimization.",

    "summary": "Task robust adaptation is a long-standing pursuit in sequential decision-making. Some risk-averse strategies, e.g., the conditional value-at-risk principle, are incorporated in domain randomization or meta reinforcement learning to prioritize difficult tasks in optimization, which demand costly intensive evaluations. The efficiency issue prompts the development of robust active task sampling to train adaptive policies, where risk-predictive models are used to surrogate policy evaluation. This work characterizes the optimization pipeline of robust active task sampling as a Markov decision process, posits theoretical and practical insights, and constitutes robustness concepts in risk-averse scenarios. Importantly, we propose an easy-to-implement method, referred to as Posterior and Diversity Synergized Task Sampling (PDTS), to accommodate fast and robust sequential decision-making. Extensive experiments show that PDTS unlocks the potential of robust active task sampling, significantly improves the zero-shot and few-shot adaptation robustness in challenging tasks, and even accelerates the learning process under certain scenarios.

    "summary": "Classification of multi-dimensional time series from real-world systems require fine-grained learning of complex features such as cross-dimensional dependencies and intra-class variations-all under the practical challenge of low training data availability. However, standard deep learning (DL) struggles to learn generalizable features in low-data environments due to model overfitting. We propose a versatile yet data-efficient framework, Intelligently Augmented Contrastive Tensor Factorization (ITA-CTF), to learn effective representations from multi-dimensional time series. The CTF module learns core explanatory components of the time series (e.g., sensor factors, temporal factors), and importantly, their joint dependencies. Notably, unlike standard tensor factorization (TF), the CTF module incorporates a new contrastive loss optimization to induce similarity learning and class-awareness into the learnt representations for better classification performance. To strengthen this contrastive learning, the preceding ITA module generates targeted but informative augmentations that highlight realistic intra-class patterns in the original data, while preserving class-wise properties. This is achieved by dynamically sampling a \"soft\" class prototype to guide the warping of each query data sample, which results in an augmentation that is intelligently pattern-mixed between the \"soft\" class prototype and the query sample. These augmentations enable the CTF module to recognize complex intra-class variations despite the limited original training data, and seek out invariant class-wise properties for accurate classification performance. The proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on five different classification tasks. Compared to standard TF and several DL benchmarks, notable performance improvements up to 18.7% were achieved.",

    "summary": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student model by minimizing the divergence between their output distributions, typically using forward Kullback-Leibler divergence (FKLD) or reverse KLD (RKLD). It has become an effective training paradigm due to the broader supervision information provided by the teacher distribution compared to one-hot labels. We identify that the core challenge in KD lies in balancing two mode-concentration effects: the \\textbf{\\textit{Hardness-Concentration}} effect, which refers to focusing on modes with large errors, and the \\textbf{\\textit{Confidence-Concentration}} effect, which refers to focusing on modes with high student confidence. Through an analysis of how probabilities are reassigned during gradient updates, we observe that these two effects are entangled in FKLD and RKLD, but in extreme forms. Specifically, both are too weak in FKLD, causing the student to fail to concentrate on the target class. In contrast, both are too strong in RKLD, causing the student to overly emphasize the target class while ignoring the broader distributional information from the teacher. To address this imbalance, we propose ABKD, a generic framework with $\\alpha$-$\\beta$-divergence. Our theoretical results show that ABKD offers a smooth interpolation between FKLD and RKLD, achieving an effective trade-off between these effects. Extensive experiments on 17 language/vision datasets with 12 teacher-student settings confirm its efficacy. The code is available at this https URL.",

    "summary": "To perform in-context learning, language models must extract signals from individual few-shot examples, aggregate these into a learned prediction rule, and then apply this rule to new examples. How is this implemented in the forward pass of modern transformer models? To study this, we consider a structured family of few-shot learning tasks for which the true prediction rule is to add an integer $k$ to the input. We find that Llama-3-8B attains high accuracy on this task for a range of $k$, and localize its few-shot ability to just three attention heads via a novel optimization approach. We further show the extracted signals lie in a six-dimensional subspace, where four of the dimensions track the unit digit and the other two dimensions track overall magnitude. We finally examine how these heads extract information from individual few-shot examples, identifying a self-correction mechanism in which mistakes from earlier examples are suppressed by later examples. Our results demonstrate how tracking low-dimensional subspaces across a forward pass can provide insight into fine-grained computational structures.",

The decoder later recovers the exemplar data stored in the latent space, rather than in raw format. Additionally, HAE is designed for both discriminative and generative modeling, enabling classification and replay capabilities, respectively. HAE adopts the charged particle system energy minimization equations and repulsive force algorithm for the incremental embedding and distribution of new class centroids in its latent space. Our results demonstrate that AHR consistently outperforms recent baselines across multiple benchmarks while operating with the same memory/compute budgets.

Our approach employs a coordination mechanism based on top-$k$ maximum spanning trees, optimizing the generation process. Each agent's decision-making is guided by a meta-model that minimizes a novel loss function, balancing accuracy and diversity.

We address this problem with KARULA, a regularized strategy for personalized federated learning, which constrains the pairwise model dissimilarities between clients based on the difference in their distributions, as measured by a surrogate for the 1-Wasserstein distance adapted for the federated setting. This allows the strategy to adapt to highly complex interrelations between clients, that e.g., clustered approaches fail to capture. We propose an inexact projected stochastic gradient algorithm to solve the constrained problem that the strategy defines, and show theoretically that it converges with smooth, possibly non-convex losses to a neighborhood of a stationary point with rate O(1/K).

However, DNNs are computationally expensive with scalability issues in real world. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their event-driven nature and low energy consumption, are particularly efficient in processing sparse and dynamic data, though they still encounter difficulties in capturing complex spatiotemporal features and performing accurate cross-class comparisons. To further enhance the performance and efficiency of SNNs in few-shot learning, we propose a few-shot learning framework based on SNNs, which combines a self-feature extractor module and a cross-feature contrastive module to refine feature representation and reduce power consumption. We apply the combination of temporal efficient training loss and InfoNCE loss to optimize the temporal dynamics of spike trains and enhance the discriminative power. Experimental results show that the proposed FSL-SNN significantly improves the classification performance on the neuromorphic dataset N-Omniglot, and also achieves competitive performance to ANNs on static datasets such as CUB and miniImageNet with low power consumption.",

    "summary": "An algorithm that outputs predictions about the state of the world will almost always be designed with the implicit or explicit goal of outputting accurate predictions (i.e., predictions that are likely to be true). In addition, the rise of increasingly powerful predictive algorithms brought about by the recent revolution in artificial intelligence has led to an emphasis on building predictive algorithms that are fair, in the sense that their predictions do not systematically evince bias or bring about harm to certain individuals or groups. This state of affairs presents two conceptual challenges. First, the goals of accuracy and fairness can sometimes be in tension, and there are no obvious normative guidelines for managing the trade-offs between these two desiderata when they arise. Second, there are many distinct ways of measuring both the accuracy and fairness of a predictive algorithm; here too, there are no obvious guidelines on how to aggregate our preferences for predictive algorithms that satisfy disparate measures of fairness and accuracy to various extents. The goal of this paper is to address these challenges by arguing that there are good reasons for using a linear combination of accuracy and fairness metrics to measure the all-things-considered value of a predictive algorithm for agents who care about both accuracy and fairness. My argument depends crucially on a classic result in the preference aggregation literature due to Harsanyi. After making this formal argument, I apply my result to an analysis of accuracy-fairness trade-offs using the COMPAS dataset compiled by Angwin et al.",

    "summary": "Realistic temporal dynamics are crucial for many video generation, processing and modelling applications, e.g. in computational fluid dynamics, weather prediction, or long-term climate simulations. Video diffusion models (VDMs) are the current state-of-the-art method for generating highly realistic dynamics. However, training VDMs from scratch can be challenging and requires large computational resources, limiting their wider application. Here, we propose a time-consistency discriminator that enables pretrained image diffusion models to generate realistic spatiotemporal dynamics. The discriminator guides the sampling inference process and does not require extensions or finetuning of the image diffusion model. We compare our approach against a VDM trained from scratch on an idealized turbulence simulation and a real-world global precipitation dataset. Our approach performs equally well in terms of temporal consistency, shows improved uncertainty calibration and lower biases compared to the VDM, and achieves stable centennial-scale climate simulations at daily time steps.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show growing promise in autonomous driving by reasoning over complex traffic scenarios to generate path plans. However, their tendencies toward overconfidence, and hallucinations raise critical safety concerns. We introduce SafePath, a modular framework that augments LLM-based path planning with formal safety guarantees using conformal prediction. SafePath operates in three stages. In the first stage, we use an LLM that generates a set of diverse candidate paths, exploring possible trajectories based on agent behaviors and environmental cues. In the second stage, SafePath filters out high-risk trajectories while guaranteeing that at least one safe option is included with a user-defined probability, through a multiple-choice question-answering formulation that integrates conformal prediction. In the final stage, our approach selects the path with the lowest expected collision risk when uncertainty is low or delegates control to a human when uncertainty is high. We theoretically prove that SafePath guarantees a safe trajectory with a user-defined probability, and we show how its human delegation rate can be tuned to balance autonomy and safety. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Highway-env show that SafePath reduces planning uncertainty by 77\\% and collision rates by up to 70\\%, demonstrating effectiveness in making LLM-driven path planning more safer.",

    "summary": "Surrogate regret bounds, also known as excess risk bounds, bridge the gap between the convergence rates of surrogate and target losses, with linear bounds favorable for their lossless regret transfer. While convex smooth surrogate losses are appealing in particular due to the efficient estimation and optimization, the existence of a trade-off between the smoothness and linear regret bound has been believed in the community. That being said, the better optimization and estimation properties of convex smooth surrogate losses may inevitably deteriorate after undergoing the regret transfer onto a target loss. We overcome this dilemma for arbitrary discrete target losses by constructing a convex smooth surrogate loss, which entails a linear surrogate regret bound composed with a tailored prediction link. The construction is based on Fenchel-Young losses generated by the convolutional negentropy, which are equivalent to the infimal convolution of a generalized negentropy and the target Bayes risk. Consequently, the infimal convolution enables us to derive a smooth loss while maintaining the surrogate regret bound linear. We additionally benefit from the infimal convolution to have a consistent estimator of the underlying class probability. Our results are overall a novel demonstration of how convex analysis penetrates into optimization and statistical efficiency in risk minimization.",

This emerging approach positions itself as a competitive alternative to traditional gradient-boosted tree methods.

The paper investigates the fairness implications of tabular ICL and explores three preprocessing strategies--correlation removal, group-balanced demonstration selection, and uncertainty-based demonstration selection--to address bias. Comprehensive experiments indicate that uncertainty-based demonstration selection consistently enhances group fairness of in-context predictions.

    "summary": "The number of agents can be an effective curriculum variable for controlling the difficulty of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks. Existing work typically uses manually defined curricula such as linear schemes. We identify two potential flaws while applying existing reward-based automatic curriculum learning methods in MARL: (1) The expected episode return used to measure task difficulty has high variance; (2) Credit assignment difficulty can be exacerbated in tasks where increasing the number of agents yields higher returns which is common in many MARL tasks. To address these issues, we propose to control the curriculum by using a TD-error based *learning progress* measure and by letting the curriculum proceed from an initial context distribution to the final task specific one. Since our approach maintains a distribution over the number of agents and measures learning progress rather than absolute performance, which often increases with the number of agents, we alleviate problem (2). Moreover, the learning progress measure naturally alleviates problem (1) by aggregating returns. In three challenging sparse-reward MARL benchmarks, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "summary": "Due to the increasing trend of performing spamming activities (e.g., Web spam, deceptive reviews, fake followers, etc.) on various online platforms to gain undeserved benefits, spam detection has emerged as a hot research issue. Previous attempts to combat spam mainly employ features related to metadata, user behaviors, or relational ties. These studies have made considerable progress in understanding and filtering spamming campaigns. However, this problem remains far from fully solved. Almost all the proposed features focus on a limited number of observed attributes or explainable phenomena, making it difficult for existing methods to achieve further improvement. To broaden the vision about solving the spam problem and address long-standing challenges (class imbalance and graph incompleteness) in the spam detection area, we propose a new attempt of utilizing signed latent factors to filter fraudulent activities. The spam-contaminated relational datasets of multiple online applications in this scenario are interpreted by the unified signed network. Two competitive and highly dissimilar algorithms of latent factors mining (LFM) models are designed based on multi-relational likelihoods estimation (LFM-MRLE) and signed pairwise ranking (LFM-SPR), respectively. We then explore how to apply the mined latent factors to spam detection tasks. Experiments on real-world datasets of different kinds of Web applications (social media and Web forum) indicate that LFM models outperform state-of-the-art baselines in detecting spamming activities. By specifically manipulating experimental data, the effectiveness of our methods in dealing with incomplete and imbalanced challenges is validated.",

    "summary": "We study learning-augmented binary search trees (BSTs) via Treaps with carefully designed priorities. The result is a simple search tree in which the depth of each item $x$ is determined by its predicted weight $w_x$. Specifically, each item $x$ is assigned a composite priority of $-\\lfloor\\log\\log(1/w_x)\\rfloor + U(0, 1)$ where $U(0, 1)$ is the uniform random variable. By choosing $w_x$ as the relative frequency of $x$, the resulting search trees achieve static optimality. This approach generalizes the recent learning-augmented BSTs [Lin-Luo-Woodruff ICML '22], which only work for Zipfian distributions, by extending them to arbitrary input distributions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can be generalized to a B-Tree data structure using the B-Treap approach [Golovin ICALP '09]. Our search trees are also capable of leveraging localities in the access sequence through online self-reorganization, thereby achieving the working-set property. Additionally, they are robust to prediction errors and support dynamic operations, such as insertions, deletions, and prediction updates. We complement our analysis with an empirical study, demonstrating that our method outperforms prior work and classic data structures.",

We extend this capability to regression with uncertainty estimation using frozen LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5, Gemini), enabling Bayesian optimization (BO) in natural language without explicit model training or feature engineering. We apply this to materials discovery by representing experimental catalyst synthesis and testing procedures as natural language prompts. A key challenge in materials discovery is the need to characterize suboptimal candidates, which slows progress. While BO is effective for navigating large design spaces, standard surrogate models like Gaussian processes assume smoothness and continuity, an assumption that fails in highly non-linear domains such as heterogeneous catalysis. Our task-agnostic BO workflow overcomes this by operating directly in language space, producing interpretable and actionable predictions without requiring structural or electronic descriptors. On benchmarks like aqueous solubility and oxidative coupling of methane (OCM), BO-ICL matches or outperforms Gaussian processes. In live experiments on the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, BO-ICL identifies near-optimal multi-metallic catalysts within six iterations from a pool of 3,700 candidates. Our method redefines materials representation and accelerates discovery, with broad applications across catalysis, materials science, and AI. Code: this https URL.",

State of the art machine learning algorithms have achieved remarkable results in classification of some heart conditions using ECG data, yet there appears to be no consensus on pre-processing best practices. Is this lack of consensus due to different conditions and architectures requiring different processing steps for optimal performance? Is it possible that state of the art deep-learning models have rendered pre-processing unnecessary? In this work we apply down-sampling, normalization, and filtering functions to 3 different multi-label ECG datasets and measure their effects on 3 different high-performing time-series classifiers. We find that sampling rates as low as 50Hz can yield comparable results to the commonly used 500Hz. This is significant as smaller sampling rates will result in smaller datasets and models, which require less time and resources to train. Additionally, despite their common usage, we found min-max normalization to be slightly detrimental overall, and band-passing to make no measurable difference. We found the blind approach to pre-processing of ECGs for multi-label classification to be ineffective, with the exception of sample rate reduction which reliably reduces computational resources, but does not increase accuracy.",

Our approach leverages meta-learning to pretrain the model on a broad set of reactor dynamics, enabling efficient adaptation to unseen reactions with minimal data. To further enhance generalizability, we incorporate physics-informed fine-tuning, ensuring physically consistent adaptation to new reactor conditions.

Memorization in LLMs is widely assumed to only occur as a result of sequences being repeated in the training data. Instead, we show that LLMs memorize by assembling information from similar sequences, a phenomena we call mosaic memory. We show major LLMs to exhibit mosaic memory, with fuzzy duplicates contributing to memorization as much as 0.8 of an exact duplicate and even heavily modified sequences contributing substantially to memorization. Despite models display reasoning capabilities, we somewhat surprisingly show memorization to be predominantly syntactic rather than semantic. We finally show fuzzy duplicates to be ubiquitous in real-world data, untouched by deduplication techniques. Taken together, our results challenge widely held beliefs and show memorization to be a more complex, mosaic process, with real-world implications for privacy, confidentiality, model utility and evaluation.",

    "summary": "The prohibitive training costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a significant bottleneck in the development of next-generation LLMs. In this paper, we show that it is possible to significantly reduce the training costs of LLMs without sacrificing their performance. Specifically, we introduce patch-level training for LLMs, in which multiple tokens are aggregated into a unit of higher information density, referred to as a `patch', to serve as the fundamental text unit for training LLMs. During patch-level training, we feed the language model shorter sequences of patches and train it to predict the next patch, thereby processing the majority of the training data at a significantly reduced cost. Following this, the model continues token-level training on the remaining training data to align with the inference mode. Experiments on a diverse range of models (370M-2.7B parameters) demonstrate that patch-level training can reduce the overall training costs to 0.5$\\times$, without compromising the model performance compared to token-level training.

    "summary": "Statistical Taylor expansion replaces the input precise variables in a conventional Taylor expansion with random variables each with known distribution, to calculate the result mean and deviation. It is based on the uncorrelated uncertainty assumption: Each input variable is measured independently with fine enough statistical precision, so that their uncertainties are independent of each other. Statistical Taylor expansion reviews that the intermediate analytic expressions can no longer be regarded as independent of each other, and the result of analytic expression should be path independent. This conclusion differs fundamentally from the conventional common approach in applied mathematics to find the best execution path for a result. This paper also presents an implementation of statistical Taylor expansion called variance arithmetic, and the tests on variance arithmetic.",

    "summary": "While many diffusion models perform well when controlling for particular aspect among style, character, and interaction, they struggle with fine-grained control due to dataset limitations and intricate model architecture design. This paper first introduces a novel training-free algorithm in fine-grained generation, Aggregation of Multiple Diffusion Models (AMDM), which integrates features from multiple diffusion models into a specified model to activate specific features and enable fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that AMDM significantly improves fine-grained control without training, validating its effectiveness. Additionally, it reveals that diffusion models initially focus on features such as position, attributes, and style, with later stages improving generation quality and consistency. AMDM offers a new perspective for tackling the challenges of fine-grained conditional control generation in diffusion models: We can fully utilize existing or develop new conditional diffusion models that control specific aspects, and then aggregate them using AMDM algorithm. This eliminates the need for constructing complex datasets, designing intricate model architectures, and incurring high training costs. Code is available at: this https URL.",

    "summary": "Breast cancer's complexity and variability pose significant challenges in understanding its progression and guiding effective treatment. This study aims to integrate protein sequence data with expression levels to improve the molecular characterization of breast cancer subtypes and predict clinical outcomes. Using ProtGPT2, a language model designed for protein sequences, we generated embeddings that capture the functional and structural properties of proteins sequence. These embeddings were integrated with protein expression level to form enriched biological representations, which were analyzed using machine learning methods like ensemble K-means for clustering and XGBoost for classification. Our approach enabled successful clustering of patients into biologically distinct groups and accurately predicted clinical outcomes such as survival and biomarkers status, achieving high performance metrics, notably an F1 score of 0.88 for survival and 0.87 for biomarkers status prediction. Feature importance analysis identified KMT2C, CLASP2, and MYO1B as key proteins involved in hormone signaling, cytoskeletal remodeling, and therapy resistance in hormone receptor-positive and triple-negative breast cancer, with potential influence on breast cancer subtype behavior and progression. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction networks and correlation analyses revealed functional interdependencies among proteins that may influence breast cancer subtype behavior and progression. These findings suggest that integrating protein sequence and expression data provides valuable insights into tumor biology and has significant potential to enhance personalized treatment strategies in breast cancer care.",

    "summary": "We introduce Latent Action Pretraining for general Action models (LAPA), an unsupervised method for pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models without ground-truth robot action labels. Existing Vision-Language-Action models require action labels typically collected by human teleoperators during pretraining, which significantly limits possible data sources and scale. In this work, we propose a method to learn from internet-scale videos that do not have robot action labels. We first train an action quantization model leveraging VQ-VAE-based objective to learn discrete latent actions between image frames, then pretrain a latent VLA model to predict these latent actions from observations and task descriptions, and finally finetune the VLA on small-scale robot manipulation data to map from latent to robot actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing techniques that train robot manipulation policies from large-scale videos. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model trained with robotic action labels on real-world manipulation tasks that require language conditioning, generalization to unseen objects, and semantic generalization to unseen instructions. Training only on human manipulation videos also shows positive transfer, opening up the potential for leveraging web-scale data for robotics foundation model.",

    "summary": "Predicting gray swan weather extremes, which are possible but so rare that they are absent from the training dataset, is a major concern for AI weather models and long-term climate emulators. An important open question is whether AI models can extrapolate from weaker weather events present in the training set to stronger, unseen weather extremes. To test this, we train independent versions of the AI model FourCastNet on the 1979-2015 ERA5 dataset with all data, or with Category 3-5 tropical cyclones (TCs) removed, either globally or only over the North Atlantic or Western Pacific basin. We then test these versions of FourCastNet on 2018-2023 Category 5 TCs (gray swans). All versions yield similar accuracy for global weather, but the one trained without Category 3-5 TCs cannot accurately forecast Category 5 TCs, indicating that these models cannot extrapolate from weaker storms. The versions trained without Category 3-5 TCs in one basin show some skill forecasting Category 5 TCs in that basin, suggesting that FourCastNet can generalize across tropical basins. This is encouraging and surprising because regional information is implicitly encoded in inputs. Given that current state-of-the-art AI weather and climate models have similar learning strategies, we expect our findings to apply to other models. Other types of weather extremes need to be similarly investigated. Our work demonstrates that novel learning strategies are needed for AI models to reliably provide early warning or estimated statistics for the rarest, most impactful TCs, and, possibly, other weather extremes.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to enable robots to learn from their own actions in the real world. Unfortunately, RL can be prohibitively expensive, in terms of on-robot runtime, due to inefficient exploration when learning from a sparse reward signal. Designing dense reward functions is labour-intensive and requires domain expertise. In our work, we propose GCR (Goal-Contrastive Rewards), a dense reward function learning method that can be trained on passive video demonstrations. By using videos without actions, our method is easier to scale, as we can use arbitrary videos. GCR combines two loss functions, an implicit value loss function that models how the reward increases when traversing a successful trajectory, and a goal-contrastive loss that discriminates between successful and failed trajectories. We perform experiments in simulated manipulation environments across RoboMimic and MimicGen tasks, as well as in the real world using a Franka arm and a Spot quadruped. We find that GCR leads to a more-sample efficient RL, enabling model-free RL to solve about twice as many tasks as our baseline reward learning methods. We also demonstrate positive cross-embodiment transfer from videos of people and of other robots performing a task. Website: this https URL.",

    "summary": "The modeling of industrial scenes is essential for simulations in industrial manufacturing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in generating general 3D scenes from textual descriptions, generating industrial scenes with LLMs poses a unique challenge due to their demand for precise measurements and positioning, requiring complex planning over spatial arrangement. To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an LLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent ensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format, layout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative requirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs powered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to 81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and effectively meeting most scene generation requirements. To further enhance accessibility, we construct SceneInstruct, a dataset designed for fine-tuning open-source LLMs to integrate into SceneGenAgent. Experiments show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on SceneInstruct yields significant performance improvements, with Llama3.1-70B approaching the capabilities of GPT-4o.

    "summary": "We propose two simple, principled and practical algorithms that enjoy provable scaling laws for the test-time compute of large language models (LLMs). The first one is a two-stage knockout-style algorithm: given an input problem, it first generates multiple candidate solutions, and then aggregate them via a knockout tournament for the final output. Assuming that the LLM can generate a correct solution with non-zero probability and do better than a random guess in comparing a pair of correct and incorrect solutions, we prove theoretically that the failure probability of this algorithm decays to zero exponentially or by a power law (depending on the specific way of scaling) as its test-time compute grows. The second one is a two-stage league-style algorithm, where each candidate is evaluated by its average win rate against multiple opponents, rather than eliminated upon loss to a single opponent. Under analogous but more robust assumptions, we prove that its failure probability also decays to zero exponentially with more test-time compute. Both algorithms require a black-box LLM and nothing else (e.g., no verifier or reward model) for a minimalistic implementation, which makes them appealing for practical applications and easy to adapt for different tasks. Through extensive experiments with diverse models and datasets, we validate the proposed theories and demonstrate the outstanding scaling properties of both algorithms.",

    "summary": "Transformer-based large-scale pre-trained models achieve great success. Fine-tuning is the standard practice for leveraging these models in downstream tasks. Among the fine-tuning methods, adapter-tuning provides a parameter-efficient fine-tuning by introducing lightweight trainable modules while keeping most pre-trained parameters frozen. However, existing adapter-tuning methods still impose substantial resource usage. Through our investigation, we show that each adapter unequally contributes to both task performance and resource usage. Motivated by this insight, we propose Selective Adapter FrEezing (SAFE), which gradually freezes less important adapters early to reduce unnecessary resource usage while maintaining performance. In our experiments, SAFE reduces memory usage, computation amount, and training time by 42.85\\%, 34.59\\%, and 11.82\\%, respectively, while achieving comparable or better task performance compared to the baseline. We also demonstrate that SAFE induces regularization effect, thereby smoothing the loss landscape, which enables the model to generalize better by avoiding sharp minima.",

In this paper, we first introduce ZeroCF, a faithful approach for leveraging important words derived from feature attribution methods to generate counterfactual examples in a zero-shot setting. Second, we present a new framework, FitCF, which further verifies aforementioned counterfactuals by label flip verification and then inserts them as demonstrations for few-shot prompting, outperforming two state-of-the-art baselines. Through ablation studies, we identify the importance of each of FitCF's core components in improving the quality of counterfactuals, as assessed through flip rate, perplexity, and similarity measures. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of LIME and Integrated Gradients as backbone attribution methods for FitCF and find that the number of demonstrations has the largest effect on performance.

Results: DISCUS outperformed competing methods, demonstrating superior reconstruction quality in terms of NMSE and SSIM (Studies I--III) and expert reader scoring (Study IV).

    "summary": "Reducing MRI scan times can improve patient care and lower healthcare costs. Many acceleration methods are designed to reconstruct diagnostic-quality images from sparse k-space data, via an ill-posed or ill-conditioned linear inverse problem (LIP). To address the resulting ambiguities, it is crucial to incorporate prior knowledge into the optimization problem, e.g., in the form of regularization. Another form of prior knowledge less commonly used in medical imaging is the readily available auxiliary data (a.k.a. side information) obtained from sources other than the current acquisition. In this paper, we present the Trust- Guided Variational Network (TGVN), an end-to-end deep learning framework that effectively and reliably integrates side information into LIPs. We demonstrate its effectiveness in multi-coil, multi-contrast MRI reconstruction, where incomplete or low-SNR measurements from one contrast are used as side information to reconstruct high-quality images of another contrast from heavily under-sampled data. TGVN is robust across different contrasts, anatomies, and field strengths. Compared to baselines utilizing side information, TGVN achieves superior image quality while preserving subtle pathological features even at challenging acceleration levels, drastically speeding up acquisition while minimizing hallucinations.

    "summary": "The reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be improved by structurally denoising their weights, yet existing techniques primarily focus on denoising the feed-forward network (FFN) of the transformer block, and can not efficiently utilise the Multi-head Attention (MHA) block, which is the core of transformer architectures. To address this issue, we propose a novel intuitive framework that, at its very core, performs MHA compression through a multi-head tensorisation process and the Tucker decomposition. This enables both higher-dimensional structured denoising and compression of the MHA weights, by enforcing a shared higher-dimensional subspace across the weights of the multiple attention heads. We demonstrate that this approach consistently enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs across multiple benchmark datasets, and for both encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, while achieving compression rates of up to $\\sim 250$ times in the MHA weights, all without requiring any additional data, training, or fine-tuning. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method can be seamlessly combined with existing FFN-only-based denoising techniques to achieve further improvements in LLM reasoning performance.",

    "summary": "Smoothness is crucial for attaining fast rates in first-order optimization. However, many optimization problems in modern machine learning involve non-smooth objectives. Recent studies relax the smoothness assumption by allowing the Lipschitz constant of the gradient to grow with respect to the gradient norm, which accommodates a broad range of objectives in practice. Despite this progress, existing generalizations of smoothness are restricted to Euclidean geometry with $\\ell_2$-norm and only have theoretical guarantees for optimization in the Euclidean space. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing a new $\\ell*$-smoothness concept that measures the norm of Hessians in terms of a general norm and its dual, and establish convergence for mirror-descent-type algorithms, matching the rates under the classic smoothness. Notably, we propose a generalized self-bounding property that facilitates bounding the gradients via controlling suboptimality gaps, serving as a principal component for convergence analysis. Beyond deterministic optimization, we establish an anytime convergence for stochastic mirror descent based on a new bounded noise condition that encompasses the widely adopted bounded or affine noise assumptions.",

Enhancing the performance of LLMs in QA contexts is becoming increasingly vital for advancing their development and applicability. This paper introduces ARR, an intuitive, effective, and general QA solving method that explicitly incorporates three key steps: analyzing the intent of the question, retrieving relevant information, and reasoning step by step. Notably, this paper is the first to introduce intent analysis in QA, which plays a vital role in ARR. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 diverse QA tasks demonstrate that ARR consistently outperforms the baseline methods. Ablation and case studies further validate the positive contributions of each ARR component. Furthermore, experiments involving variations in prompt design indicate that ARR maintains its effectiveness regardless of the specific prompt formulation. Additionally, extensive evaluations across various model sizes, LLM series, and generation settings solidify the effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of ARR.",

    "summary": "Power grid operation is becoming more complex due to the increase in generation of renewable energy. The recent series of Learning To Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions have encouraged the use of artificial agents to assist human dispatchers in operating power grids. However, the combinatorial nature of the action space poses a challenge to both conventional optimizers and learned controllers. Action space factorization, which breaks down decision-making into smaller sub-tasks, is one approach to tackle the curse of dimensionality. In this study, we propose a centrally coordinated multi-agent (CCMA) architecture for action space factorization. In this approach, regional agents propose actions and subsequently a coordinating agent selects the final action. We investigate several implementations of the CCMA architecture, and benchmark in different experimental settings against various L2RPN baseline approaches. The CCMA architecture exhibits higher sample efficiency and superior final performance than the baseline approaches. The results suggest high potential of the CCMA approach for further application in higher-dimensional L2RPN as well as real-world power grid settings.",

    "summary": "Reconstructing MRI from highly undersampled measurements is crucial for accelerating medical imaging, but is challenging due to the ill-posedness of the inverse problem. While supervised deep learning (DL) approaches have shown remarkable success, they traditionally rely on fully-sampled ground truth (GT) images, which are expensive or impossible to obtain in real scenarios. This problem has created a recent surge in interest in self-supervised learning methods that do not require GT. Although recent methods are now fast approaching \"oracle\" supervised performance, the lack of systematic comparison and standard experimental setups are hindering targeted methodological research and precluding widespread trustworthy industry adoption. We present SSIBench, a modular and flexible comparison framework to unify and thoroughly benchmark Self-Supervised Imaging methods (SSI) without GT. We evaluate 18 methods across 4 realistic MRI scenarios on real data, showing a wide performance landscape whose method ranking differs across scenarios and metrics, exposing the need for further SSI research. Our insights also show how complementary methods could be compounded for future improvements, exemplified by a novel loss we propose, Multi-Operator Equivariant Imaging. To accelerate reproducible research and lower the barrier to entry, we provide the extensible benchmark and open-source reimplementations of all methods at this https URL, allowing researchers to rapidly and fairly contribute and evaluate new methods on the standardised setup for potential leaderboard ranking, or benchmark existing methods on custom datasets, forward operators, or models, unlocking the application of SSI to other valuable GT free domains such as 4D MRI and other nascent scientific imaging modalities.",

    "summary": "Speculative inference is a promising paradigm employing small speculative models (SSMs) as drafters to generate draft tokens, which are subsequently verified in parallel by the target large language model (LLM). This approach enhances the efficiency of inference serving by reducing LLM inference latency and costs while preserving generation quality. However, existing speculative methods face critical challenges, including inefficient resource utilization and limited draft acceptance, which constrain their scalability and overall effectiveness. To overcome these obstacles, we present CoSine, a novel speculative inference system that decouples sequential speculative decoding from parallel verification, enabling efficient collaboration among multiple nodes. Specifically, CoSine routes inference requests to specialized drafters based on their expertise and incorporates a confidence-based token fusion mechanism to synthesize outputs from cooperating drafters, ensuring high-quality draft generation. Additionally, CoSine dynamically orchestrates the execution of speculative decoding and verification in a pipelined manner, employing batch scheduling to selectively group requests and adaptive speculation control to minimize idle periods. By optimizing parallel workflows through heterogeneous node collaboration, CoSine balances draft generation and verification throughput in real-time, thereby maximizing resource utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that CoSine achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art speculative approaches. Notably, with equivalent resource costs, CoSine achieves up to a 23.2% decrease in latency and a 32.5% increase in throughput compared to baseline methods.",

These results demonstrated that domain-adapted MM-LLMs perform for UML code generation automation, whereby, at the best model, it achieved BLEU and SSIM scores of 0.779 and 0.942 on sequence diagrams.

    "summary": "Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) offer a principled framework for learning and inference in nonlinear dynamical systems with uncertainty quantification. However, existing GPSSMs are limited by the use of multiple independent stationary Gaussian processes (GPs), leading to prohibitive computational and parametric complexity in high-dimensional settings and restricted modeling capacity for non-stationary dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETGPSSM) for scalable and flexible modeling of high-dimensional, non-stationary dynamical systems. Specifically, our ETGPSSM integrates a single shared GP with input-dependent normalizing flows, yielding an expressive implicit process prior that captures complex, non-stationary transition dynamics while significantly reducing model complexity. For the inference of the implicit process, we develop a variational inference algorithm that jointly approximates the posterior over the underlying GP and the neural network parameters defining the normalizing flows. To avoid explicit variational parameterization of the latent states, we further incorporate the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into the variational framework, enabling accurate and efficient state estimation. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based SSMs in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.",

    "summary": "Recent mainstream unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS) motion-appearance approaches use either the bi-encoder structure to separately encode motion and appearance features, or the uni-encoder structure for joint encoding. However, these methods fail to properly balance the motion-appearance relationship. Consequently, even with complex fusion modules for motion-appearance integration, the extracted suboptimal features degrade the models' overall performance. Moreover, the quality of optical flow varies across scenarios, making it insufficient to rely solely on optical flow to achieve high-quality segmentation results. To address these challenges, we propose the Saliency-Motion guided Trunk-Collateral Network (SMTC-Net), which better balances the motion-appearance relationship and incorporates model's intrinsic saliency information to enhance segmentation performance. Specifically, considering that optical flow maps are derived from RGB images, they share both commonalities and differences. Accordingly, we propose a novel Trunk-Collateral structure for motion-appearance UVOS. The shared trunk backbone captures the motion-appearance commonality, while the collateral branch learns the uniqueness of motion features. Furthermore, an Intrinsic Saliency guided Refinement Module (ISRM) is devised to efficiently leverage the model's intrinsic saliency information to refine high-level features, and provide pixel-level guidance for motion-appearance fusion, thereby enhancing performance without additional input. Experimental results show that SMTC-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance on three UVOS datasets ( 89.2% J&F on DAVIS-16, 76% J on YouTube-Objects, 86.4% J on FBMS ) and four standard video salient object detection (VSOD) benchmarks with the notable increase, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority over previous methods.",

A key innovation is our mapping model that establishes correspondences between 2D image pixels, UV pattern coordinates, and 3D geometry, enabling joint optimization of both 3D garment meshes and the corresponding 2D patterns by aligning learned priors with image observations. Despite training exclusively on synthetically simulated cloth data, our method generalizes effectively to real-world images, outperforming existing approaches on both tight- and loose-fitting garments.

Key innovations include: (1) rigorous control of \\textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain strictly below $\\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes inversely with $\\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces theoretical guarantees across all $\\alpha$ values. The framework achieves stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios, underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems, offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware decision-making.",

    "summary": "Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences through reinforcement learning (RL). To provide accurate reward signals, a reward model (RM) should stimulate deep thinking and conduct interpretable reasoning before assigning a score or a judgment. Inspired by recent advances of long chain-of-thought (CoT) on reasoning-intensive tasks, we hypothesize and validate that integrating reasoning capabilities into reward modeling significantly enhances RM's interpretability and performance. To this end, we introduce a new class of generative reward models -- Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) -- which formulate reward modeling as a reasoning task. We propose a reasoning-oriented training pipeline and train a family of ReasRMs, RM-R1. RM-R1 features a chain-of-rubrics (CoR) mechanism -- self-generating sample-level chat rubrics or math/code solutions, and evaluating candidate responses against them. The training of M-R1 consists of two key stages: (1) distillation of high-quality reasoning chains and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Empirically, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across three reward model benchmarks on average, outperforming much larger open-weight models (e.g., INF-ORM-Llama3.1-70B) and proprietary ones (e.g., GPT-4o) by up to 4.9%. Beyond final performance, we perform thorough empirical analysis to understand the key ingredients of successful ReasRM training. To facilitate future research, we release six ReasRM models along with code and data at this https URL.",

However, despite their widespread deployment in inference services such as ChatGPT, concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive user data have arisen. Existing solutions primarily rely on privacy-enhancing technologies to mitigate such risks, facing the trade-off among efficiency, privacy, and utility. To narrow this gap, we propose Cape, a context-aware prompt perturbation mechanism based on differential privacy, to enable efficient inference with an improved privacy-utility trade-off. Concretely, we introduce a hybrid utility function that better captures the token similarity. Additionally, we propose a bucketized sampling mechanism to handle large sampling space, which might lead to long-tail phenomenons. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, along with ablation studies, demonstrate that Cape achieves a better privacy-utility trade-off compared to prior state-of-the-art works.",

    "summary": "While classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized image classification, the emergence of quantum computing presents new opportunities for enhancing neural network architectures. Quantum CNNs (QCNNs) leverage quantum mechanical properties and hold potential to outperform classical approaches. However, their implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices remains challenging due to hardware limitations. In our research, we address this challenge by introducing an encoding scheme that significantly reduces the input dimensionality. We demonstrate that a primitive QCNN architecture with 49 qubits is sufficient to directly process $28\\times 28$ pixel MNIST images, eliminating the need for classical dimensionality reduction pre-processing. Additionally, we propose an automated framework based on expressibility, entanglement, and complexity characteristics to identify the building blocks of QCNNs, parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Our approach demonstrates advantages in accuracy and convergence speed with a similar parameter count compared to both hybrid QCNNs and classical CNNs. We validated our experiments on IBM's Heron r2 quantum processor, achieving $96.08\\%$ classification accuracy, surpassing the $71.74\\%$ benchmark of traditional approaches under identical training conditions. These results represent one of the first implementations of image classifications on real quantum hardware and validate the potential of quantum computing in this area.",

This is particularly critical in public health, where failure to retrieve relevant, accurate, and current information could significantly impact UK residents. However, currently little is known about LLM knowledge of UK Government public health information. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new benchmark, PubHealthBench, with over 8000 questions for evaluating LLMs' Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and free form responses to public health queries. To create PubHealthBench we extract free text from 687 current UK government guidance documents and implement an automated pipeline for generating MCQA samples. Assessing 24 LLMs on PubHealthBench we find the latest private LLMs (GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1 and o1) have a high degree of knowledge, achieving >90% accuracy in the MCQA setup, and outperform humans with cursory search engine use. However, in the free form setup we see lower performance with no model scoring >75%. Importantly we find in both setups LLMs have higher accuracy on guidance intended for the general public. Therefore, there are promising signs that state of the art (SOTA) LLMs are an increasingly accurate source of public health information, but additional safeguards or tools may still be needed when providing free form responses on public health topics.",

However, most existing approaches heavily rely on scaling action-annotated data to enhance their capabilities. Consequently, they are often limited to single physical specification and struggle to learn transferable knowledge across different embodiments and environments. To confront these limitations, we propose UniVLA, a new framework for learning cross-embodiment vision-language-action (VLA) policies. Our key innovation is to derive task-centric action representations from videos with a latent action model. This enables us to exploit extensive data across a wide spectrum of embodiments and perspectives. To mitigate the effect of task-irrelevant dynamics, we incorporate language instructions and establish a latent action model within the DINO feature space. Learned from internet-scale videos, the generalist policy can be deployed to various robots through efficient latent action decoding. We obtain state-of-the-art results across multiple manipulation and navigation benchmarks, as well as real-robot deployments. UniVLA achieves superior performance over OpenVLA with less than 1/20 of pretraining compute and 1/10 of downstream data. Continuous performance improvements are observed as heterogeneous data, even including human videos, are incorporated into the training pipeline. The results underscore UniVLA's potential to facilitate scalable and efficient robot policy learning.",

    "summary": "Machine learning potentials have achieved great success in accelerating atomistic simulations. Many of them rely on local descriptors that readily allow parallelization. More recent message passing neural network (MPNN) models have demonstrated their superior accuracy and become increasingly popular. However, parallelizing MPNN models for large-scale simulations across compute nodes remains a challenge, as the previously argued poor scalability with the number of MP layers and the necessity of data communication. Here, we propose an efficient parallel algorithm for MPNN models, in which additional data communication is minimized among local atoms only in each MP layer without redundant computation, thus scaling linearly with the layer number. Integrated with our recursively embedded atom neural network model, this algorithm demonstrates excellent strong scaling and weak scaling behaviors in several benchmark systems. This approach enables massive molecular dynamics simulations on MPNN models for hundreds of millions of atoms as fast as on strictly local models, vastly extending the applicability of the MPNN potential to an unprecedented scale. This general parallelization framework can empower various MPNN models to efficiently simulate very large and complex systems.",

    "summary": "Human videos offer a scalable way to train robot manipulation policies, but lack the action labels needed by standard imitation learning algorithms. Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Sim introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes.

This study introduces a novel deep learning-based diagnosis assistant tool for grading inhalation injuries using bronchoscopy images to overcome subjective variability and enhance consistency in severity assessment. Our approach leverages data augmentation techniques, including graphic transformations, Contrastive Unpaired Translation (CUT), and CycleGAN, to address the scarcity of medical imaging data. We evaluate the classification performance of two deep learning models, GoogLeNet and Vision Transformer (ViT), across a dataset significantly expanded through these augmentation methods. The results demonstrate GoogLeNet combined with CUT as the most effective configuration for grading inhalation injuries through bronchoscopy images and achieves a classification accuracy of 97.8%. The histograms and frequency analysis evaluations reveal variations caused by the augmentation CUT with distribution changes in the histogram and texture details of the frequency spectrum. PCA visualizations underscore the CUT substantially enhances class separability in the feature space. Moreover, Grad-CAM analyses provide insight into the decision-making process; mean intensity for CUT heatmaps is 119.6, which significantly exceeds 98.8 of the original datasets. Our proposed tool leverages mechanical ventilation periods as a novel grading standard, providing comprehensive diagnostic support.",

    "summary": "Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal disorder that results in blurry and distorted vision. Traditional diagnostic tools, while effective, are often bulky, costly, and require professional operation. In this paper, we present a portable and innovative methodology for diagnosing. Our proposed approach first captures the image reflected on the eye's cornea when a smartphone screen-generated Placido disc sheds its light on an eye, then utilizes a two-stage diagnosis for identifying the KC cornea and pinpointing the location of the KC on the cornea. The first stage estimates the height and width of the Placido disc extracted from the captured image to identify whether it has KC. In this KC identification, k-means clustering is implemented to discern statistical characteristics, such as height and width values of extracted Placido discs, from non-KC (control) and KC-affected groups. The second stage involves the creation of a distance matrix, providing a precise localization of KC on the cornea, which is critical for efficient treatment planning. The analysis of these distance matrices, paired with a logistic regression model and robust statistical analysis, reveals a clear distinction between control and KC groups. The logistic regression model, which classifies small areas on the cornea as either control or KC-affected based on the corresponding inter-disc distances in the distance matrix, reported a classification accuracy of 96.94%, which indicates that we can effectively pinpoint the protrusion caused by KC. This comprehensive, smartphone-based method is expected to detect KC and streamline timely treatment.",

In the weak variant, typeability coincides with termination of the stack machine and with spine normalization, while exactly measuring the transitions in machine evaluation. The strong variant characterizes strong normalization through a notion of perpetual evaluation, while giving an upper bound to the length of reductions. Through the encoding of effects, quantitative typeability coincides with termination for higher-order mutable store, input/output, and probabilistic choice.",

    "summary": "In this article, we show that the now classical protocol complex approach to distributed task solvability of Herlihy et al. can be understood in standard categorical terms. First, protocol complexes are functors, from chromatic (semi-) simplicial sets to chromatic simplicial sets, that naturally give rise to algebras. These algebras describe the next state operator for the corresponding distributed systems. This is constructed for semi-synchronous distributed systems with general patterns of communication for which we show that these functors are always Yoneda extensions of simpler functors, implying a number of interesting properties. Furthermore, for these protocol complex functors, we prove the existence of a free algebra on any initial chromatic simplicial complex, modeling iterated protocol complexes. Under this categorical formalization, protocol complexes are seen as transition systems, where states are structured as chromatic simplicial sets. We exploit the epistemic interpretation of chromatic simplicial sets and the underlying transition system (or algebra) structure to introduce a temporal-epistemic logic and its semantics on all free algebras on chromatic simplicial sets. We end up by giving hints on how to extend this framework to more general dynamic network graphs and state-dependent protocols, and give example in fault-tolerant distributed systems and mobile robotics.",

    "summary": "Many first-order equational theories, such as the theory of groups or boolean algebras, can be presented by a smaller set of axioms than the original one. Recent studies showed that a homological approach to equational theories gives us inequalities to obtain lower bounds on the number of axioms. In this paper, we extend this result to higher-order equational theories. More precisely, we consider simply typed lambda calculus with product and unit types and study sets of equations between lambda terms. Then, we define homology groups of the given equational theory and show that a lower bound on the number of equations can be computed from the homology groups.",

    "summary": "Temporal causality defines what property causes some observed temporal behavior (the effect) in a given computation, based on a counterfactual analysis of similar computations. In this paper, we study its closure properties and the complexity of computing causes. For the former, we establish that safety, reachability, and recurrence properties are all closed under causal inference: If the effect is from one of these property classes, then the cause for this effect is from the same class. We also show that persistence and obligation properties are not closed in this way. These results rest on a topological characterization of causes which makes them applicable to a wide range of similarity relations between computations. Finally, our complexity analysis establishes improved upper bounds for computing causes for safety, reachability, and recurrence properties. We also present the first lower bounds for all of the classes.",

Despite their widespread use, the algebraic theory underlying APAs has remained largely unexplored. In recent work, a notation for non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs) was introduced, along with a sound and complete axiomatisation of their equational theory via right-linear algebras. In this paper, we extend that line of work, in particular to the setting of infinite words. We present a dualised syntax, yielding a notation for APAs based on right-linear lattice expressions, and provide a natural axiomatisation of their equational theory with respect to the standard language model of {\\omega}-regular languages. The design of this axiomatisation is guided by the theory of fixed point logics; in fact, the completeness factors cleanly through the completeness of the linear-time {\\mu}-calculus.",

We show that a perfect normalizing algorithm exists but is computationally expensive. We then describe an approximate algorithm and evaluate it on a set of benchmarks from related work, as well as a large set of benchmarks sampled from SMT-LIB.

The system and the environment interact via sets $I$ and $O$ of input and output signals. The input to the synthesis problem contains, in addition to a specification, also a list of secrets, a function $cost: I\\cup O\\rightarrow\\mathbb{N}$, which maps each signal to the cost of hiding it, and a bound $b\\in\\mathbb{N}$ on the budget that the system may use for hiding of signals. The desired output is an $(I/O)$-transducer $T$ and a set $H\\subseteq I\\cup O$ of signals that respects the bound on the budget, thus $\\sum_{s\\in H} cost(s)\\leq b$, such that for every possible interaction of $T$, the generated computation satisfies the specification, yet an observer, from whom the signals in $H$ are hidden, cannot evaluate the secrets.\nWe first show that the problem's complexity is 2EXPTIME-complete for specifications and secrets in LTL, making it no harder than synthesis without privacy requirements. We then analyze the complexity further, isolating the two aspects that do not exist in traditional synthesis: the need to hide secret values and the need to choose the set $H$. We do this by studying settings in which traditional synthesis is solvable in polynomial time -- when the specification formalism is deterministic automata and when the system is closed -- and show that each of these aspects adds an exponential blow-up in complexity. We continue and study bounded synthesis with privacy, where the input includes a bound on the synthesized transducer size, as well as a variant of the problem in which the observer has knowledge, either about the specification or about the system, which can be helpful in evaluating the secrets. Additionally, we study certified privacy, where the synthesis algorithm provides certification that the secrets remain hidden.",

    "summary": "Parity games have witnessed several new quasi-polynomial algorithms since the breakthrough result of Calude et al. (STOC 2017). The combinatorial object underlying these approaches is a universal tree, as identified by Czerwi≈Ñski et al. (SODA 2019). By proving a quasi-polynomial lower bound on the size of a universal tree, they have highlighted a barrier that must be overcome by all existing approaches to attain polynomial running time. This is due to the existence of worst case instances which force these algorithms to explore a large portion of the tree.\nAs an attempt to overcome this barrier, we propose a strategy iteration framework which can be applied on any universal tree. It is at least as fast as its value iteration counterparts, while allowing one to take bigger leaps in the universal tree. Our main technical contribution is an efficient method for computing the least fixed point of 1-player games. This is achieved via a careful adaptation of shortest path algorithms to the setting of ordered trees. By plugging in the universal tree of Jurdzi≈Ñski and Laziƒá (LICS 2017), or the Strahler universal tree of Daviaud et al. (ICALP 2020), we obtain instantiations of the general framework that take time $O(mn^2\\log n\\log d)$ and $O(mn^2\\log^3 n \\log d)$ respectively per iteration.",

    "summary": "We develop fibrational perspectives on context-free grammars and on nondeterministic finite-state automata over categories and operads. A generalized CFG is a functor from a free colored operad (aka multicategory) generated by a pointed finite species into an arbitrary base operad: this encompasses classical CFGs by taking the base to be a certain operad constructed from a free monoid, as an instance of a more general construction of an \\emph{operad of spliced arrows} $\\mathcal{W}\\,\\mathcal{C}$ for any category $\\mathcal{C}$. A generalized NFA is a functor from an arbitrary bipointed category or pointed operad satisfying the unique lifting of factorizations and finite fiber properties: this encompasses classical word automata and tree automata without $\\epsilon$-transitions, but also automata over non-free categories and operads. We show that generalized context-free and regular languages satisfy suitable generalizations of many of the usual closure properties, and in particular we give a simple conceptual proof that context-free languages are closed under intersection with regular languages. Finally, we observe that the splicing functor $\\mathcal{W} : Cat \\to Oper$ admits a left adjoint $\\mathcal{C}: Oper \\to Cat$, which we call the \\emph{contour category} construction since the arrows of $\\mathcal{C}\\,\\mathcal{O}$ have a geometric interpretation as oriented contours of operations of $\\mathcal{O}$. A direct consequence of the contour / splicing adjunction is that every pointed finite species induces a universal CFG generating a language of \\emph{tree contour words.} This leads us to a generalization of the Chomsky-Sch√ºtzenberger Representation Theorem, establishing that a subset of a homset $L \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}(A,B)$ is a CFL of arrows if and only if it is a functorial image of the intersection of a $\\mathcal{C}$-chromatic tree contour language with a regular language.",

    "summary": "Finding Lyapunov functions to certify the stability of control systems has been an important topic for verifying safety-critical systems. Most existing methods on finding Lyapunov functions require access to the dynamics of the system. Accurately describing the complete dynamics of a control system however remains highly challenging in practice. Latest trend of using learning-enabled control systems further reduces the transparency. Hence, a method for black-box systems would have much wider applications.\nOur work stems from the recent idea of sampling and exploiting Lipschitz continuity to approximate the unknown dynamics. Given Lipschitz constants, one can derive a non-statistical upper bounds on approximation errors; hence a strong certification on this approximation can certify the unknown dynamics. We significantly improve this idea by directly approximating the Lie derivative of Lyapunov functions instead of the dynamics. We propose a framework based on the learner-verifier architecture from Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS). Our insight of combining regional verification conditions and counterexample-guided sampling enables a guided search for samples to prove stability region-by-region. Our CEGIS algorithm further ensures termination.\nOur numerical experiments suggest that it is possible to prove the stability of 2D and 3D systems with a few thousands of samples. Our visualization also reveals the regions where the stability is difficult to prove. In comparison with the existing black-box approach, our approach at the best case requires less than 0.01% of samples.",

Inspired by biological altruism, we introduce a framework that evaluates when individual agents should incur costs to benefit their neighbors. By adapting Hamilton's rule, we define agent ``fitness\" in terms of task productivity rather than genetic survival. We formalize altruistic decision-making through a graph-based model of multi-agent interactions and propose a solution using collaborative control Lyapunov functions. The approach ensures that altruistic behaviors contribute to the collective goal-reaching efficiency of the system. We illustrate this framework on a multi-agent way-point navigation problem, where we show through simulation how agent importance levels influence altruistic decision-making, leading to improved coordination in navigation tasks.",

    "summary": "The multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem asks to find a set of paths on a graph such that when synchronously following these paths the agents never encounter a conflict. In the most widespread MAPF formulation, the so-called Classical MAPF, the agents sizes are neglected and two types of conflicts are considered: occupying the same vertex or using the same edge at the same time step. Meanwhile in numerous practical applications, e.g. in robotics, taking into account the agents' sizes is vital to ensure that the MAPF solutions can be safely executed. Introducing large agents yields an additional type of conflict arising when one agent follows an edge and its body overlaps with the body of another agent that is actually not using this same edge (e.g. staying still at some distinct vertex of the graph). Until now it was not clear how harder the problem gets when such conflicts are to be considered while planning. Specifically, it was known that Classical MAPF problem on an undirected graph can be solved in polynomial time, however no complete polynomial-time algorithm was presented to solve MAPF with large agents. In this paper we, for the first time, establish that the latter problem is NP-hard and, thus, if P!=NP no polynomial algorithm for it can, unfortunately, be presented. Our proof is based on the prevalent in the field technique of reducing the seminal 3SAT problem (which is known to be an NP-complete problem) to the problem at hand. In particular, for an arbitrary 3SAT formula we procedurally construct a dedicated graph with specific start and goal vertices and show that the given 3SAT formula is satisfiable iff the corresponding path finding instance has a solution.",

    "summary": "We propose a new framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the agents cooperate in a time-evolving network with latent community structures and mixed memberships. Unlike traditional neighbor-based or fixed interaction graphs, our community-based framework captures flexible and abstract coordination patterns by allowing each agent to belong to multiple overlapping communities. Each community maintains shared policy and value functions, which are aggregated by individual agents according to personalized membership weights. We also design actor-critic algorithms that exploit this structure: agents inherit community-level estimates for policy updates and value learning, enabling structured information sharing without requiring access to other agents' policies. Importantly, our approach supports both transfer learning by adapting to new agents or tasks via membership estimation, and active learning by prioritizing uncertain communities during exploration. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees under linear function approximation for both actor and critic updates. To our knowledge, this is the first MARL framework that integrates community structure, transferability, and active learning with provable guarantees.",

    "summary": "We study binary-action pairwise-separable network games that encompass both coordinating and anti-coordinating behaviors. Our model is grounded in an underlying directed signed graph, where each link is associated with a weight that describes the strenght and nature of the interaction. The utility for each agent is an aggregation of pairwise terms determined by the weights of the signed graph in addition to an individual bias term. We consider a scenario that assumes the presence of a prominent 'cohesive' subset of players, who are either connected exclusively by positive weights, or forms a structurally balanced subset that can be bipartitioned into two adversarial subcommunities with positive intra-community and negative inter-community edges. Given the properties of the game restricted to the remaining players, our results guarantee the existence of Nash equilibria characterized by a consensus or, respectively, a polarization within the first group, as well as their stability under best response transitions. Our results can be interpreted as robustness results, building on the supermodular properties of coordination games and on a novel use of the concept of graph cohesiveness.",

    "summary": "As demand for intelligent services rises and edge devices become more capable, distributed learning at the network edge has emerged as a key enabling technology. While existing paradigms like federated learning (FL) and decentralized FL (DFL) enable privacy-preserving distributed learning in many scenarios, they face potential challenges in connectivity and synchronization imposed by resource-constrained and infrastructure-less environments. While more robust, gossip learning (GL) algorithms have generally been designed for homogeneous data distributions and may not suit all contexts. This paper introduces Chisme, a novel suite of protocols designed to address the challenges of implementing robust intelligence in the network edge, characterized by heterogeneous data distributions, episodic connectivity, and lack of infrastructure. Chisme includes both synchronous DFL (Chisme-DFL) and asynchronous GL (Chisme-GL) variants that enable collaborative yet decentralized model training that considers underlying data heterogeneity. We introduce a data similarity heuristic that allows agents to opportunistically infer affinity with each other using the existing communication of model updates in decentralized FL and GL. We leverage the heuristic to extend DFL's model aggregation and GL's model merge mechanisms for better personalized training while maintaining collaboration. While Chisme-DFL is a synchronous decentralized approach whose resource utilization scales linearly with network size, Chisme-GL is fully asynchronous and has a lower, constant resource requirement independent of network size. We demonstrate that Chisme methods outperform their standard counterparts in model training over distributed and heterogeneous data in network scenarios ranging from less connected and reliable networks to fully connected and lossless networks.",

This whitepaper chronicles this remarkable journey, charting the key technological milestones--advancements in prompting, training methodologies, hardware capabilities, and architectural innovations--that have converged to create the AI agents of today. We argue that these agents, exemplified by systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT with plugins and xAI's Grok, represent a culminating phase in AI development, potentially constituting the \"final generation\" of intelligence as we currently conceive it. We explore the capabilities and underlying technologies of these agents, grounded in practical examples, while also examining the profound societal implications and the unprecedented pace of progress that suggests intelligence is now doubling approximately every six months.

We consider $N$ agents grouped into $M$ clusters, where each cluster solves a stochastic bandit problem. The mapping between agents and bandits is a priori unknown. Each bandit is associated with $K$ arms, and the goal is to identify the best arm for each agent under a $\\delta$-probably correct ($\\delta$-PC) framework, while minimizing sample complexity and communication overhead.\nWe propose two novel algorithms: Clustering then Best Arm Identification (Cl-BAI) and Best Arm Identification then Clustering (BAI-Cl). Cl-BAI uses a two-phase approach that first clusters agents based on the bandit problems they are learning, followed by identifying the best arm for each cluster. BAI-Cl reverses the sequence by identifying the best arms first and then clustering agents accordingly. Both algorithms leverage the successive elimination framework to ensure computational efficiency and high accuracy.\nWe establish $\\delta$-PC guarantees for both methods, derive bounds on their sample complexity, and provide a lower bound for this problem class. Moreover, when $M$ is small (a constant), we show that the sample complexity of a variant of BAI-Cl is minimax optimal in an order-wise sense. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets (MovieLens, Yelp) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of sample and communication efficiency, particularly in settings where $M \\ll N$.",

Existing methods combining sampling-based planners with trajectory optimization produce suboptimal results and lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Physically-coupled discontinuity-bounded Conflict-Based Search (pc-dbCBS), an anytime kinodynamic motion planner, that extends discontinuity-bounded CBS to rigidly-coupled systems. Our approach proposes a tri-level conflict detection and resolution framework that includes the physical coupling between the robots. Moreover, pc-dbCBS alternates iteratively between state space representations, thereby preserving probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality while relying only on single-robot motion primitives. Across 25 simulated and six real-world problems involving multirotors carrying a cable-suspended payload and differential-drive robots linked by rigid rods, pc-dbCBS solves up to 92% more instances than a state-of-the-art baseline and plans trajectories that are 50-60% faster while reducing planning time by an order of magnitude.",

    "summary": "Power grid operation is becoming more complex due to the increase in generation of renewable energy. The recent series of Learning To Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions have encouraged the use of artificial agents to assist human dispatchers in operating power grids. However, the combinatorial nature of the action space poses a challenge to both conventional optimizers and learned controllers. Action space factorization, which breaks down decision-making into smaller sub-tasks, is one approach to tackle the curse of dimensionality. In this study, we propose a centrally coordinated multi-agent (CCMA) architecture for action space factorization. In this approach, regional agents propose actions and subsequently a coordinating agent selects the final action. We investigate several implementations of the CCMA architecture, and benchmark in different experimental settings against various L2RPN baseline approaches. The CCMA architecture exhibits higher sample efficiency and superior final performance than the baseline approaches. The results suggest high potential of the CCMA approach for further application in higher-dimensional L2RPN as well as real-world power grid settings.",

    "summary": "The number of agents can be an effective curriculum variable for controlling the difficulty of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks. Existing work typically uses manually defined curricula such as linear schemes. We identify two potential flaws while applying existing reward-based automatic curriculum learning methods in MARL: (1) The expected episode return used to measure task difficulty has high variance; (2) Credit assignment difficulty can be exacerbated in tasks where increasing the number of agents yields higher returns which is common in many MARL tasks. To address these issues, we propose to control the curriculum by using a TD-error based *learning progress* measure and by letting the curriculum proceed from an initial context distribution to the final task specific one. Since our approach maintains a distribution over the number of agents and measures learning progress rather than absolute performance, which often increases with the number of agents, we alleviate problem (2). Moreover, the learning progress measure naturally alleviates problem (1) by aggregating returns. In three challenging sparse-reward MARL benchmarks, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "summary": "Diffusion-based generative models have significantly advanced text-to-image synthesis, demonstrating impressive text comprehension and zero-shot generalization. These models refine images from random noise based on textual prompts, with initial reliance on text input shifting towards enhanced visual fidelity over time. This transition suggests that static model parameters might not optimally address the distinct phases of generation. We introduce LGR-AD (Learning Graph Representation of Agent Diffusers), a novel multi-agent system designed to improve adaptability in dynamic computer vision tasks. LGR-AD models the generation process as a distributed system of interacting agents, each representing an expert sub-model. These agents dynamically adapt to varying conditions and collaborate through a graph neural network that encodes their relationships and performance metrics. Our approach employs a coordination mechanism based on top-$k$ maximum spanning trees, optimizing the generation process. Each agent's decision-making is guided by a meta-model that minimizes a novel loss function, balancing accuracy and diversity. Theoretical analysis and extensive empirical evaluations show that LGR-AD outperforms traditional diffusion models across various benchmarks, highlighting its potential for scalable and flexible solutions in complex image generation tasks.

Existing studies have explored various fusion paradigms and consistency constraints to improve the alignment of equivalent entities, while overlooking that the visual modality may not always contribute positively. Empirically, entities with low-similarity images usually generate unsatisfactory performance, highlighting the limitation of overly relying on visual features. We believe the model can be biased toward the visual modality, leading to a shortcut image-matching task. To address this, we propose a counterfactual debiasing framework for MMEA, termed CDMEA, which investigates visual modality bias from a causal perspective. Our approach aims to leverage both visual and graph modalities to enhance MMEA while suppressing the direct causal effect of the visual modality on model predictions. By estimating the Total Effect (TE) of both modalities and excluding the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of the visual modality, we ensure that the model predicts based on the Total Indirect Effect (TIE), effectively utilizing both modalities and reducing visual modality bias. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets show that CDMEA outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods, especially in low-similarity, high-noise, and low-resource data scenarios.",

    "summary": "Fast Ewald summation is the most widely used approach for computing long-range Coulomb interactions in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. While the asymptotic scaling is nearly optimal, its performance on parallel architectures is dominated by the global communication required for the underlying fast Fourier transform (FFT). Here, we develop a novel method, ESP - Ewald summation with prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWFs) - that, for a fixed precision, sharply reduces the size of this transform by performing the Ewald split via a PSWF. In addition, PSWFs minimize the cost of spreading and interpolation steps that move information between the particles and the underlying uniform grid. We have integrated the ESP method into two widely-used open-source MD packages: LAMMPS and GROMACS. Detailed benchmarks show that this reduces the cost of computing far-field electrostatic interactions by an order of magnitude, leading to better strong scaling with respect to number of cores.

    "summary": "This work presents a methodology for reconstructing the spatial distribution of the neutron flux in a nuclear reactor, leveraging real-time measurements obtained from ex-core detectors. The Kirchhoff-Helmholtz (K-H) equation inherently defines the problem of estimating a scalar field within a domain based on boundary data, making it a natural mathematical framework for this task. The main challenge lies in deriving the Green's function specific to the domain and the neutron diffusion process. While analytical solutions for Green's functions exist for simplified geometries, their derivation of complex, heterogeneous domains-such as a nuclear reactor-requires a numerical approach. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the well-posedness of the data-driven Green's function approximation by formulating and solving the K-H equation as an inverse problem. After establishing the symmetry properties that the Green's function must satisfy, the K-H equation is derived from the one-speed neutron diffusion model. This is followed by a comprehensive description of the procedure for interpreting sensor readings and implementing the neutron flux reconstruction algorithm. Finally, the existence and uniqueness of the Green's function inferred from the sampled data are demonstrated, ensuring the reliability of the proposed method and its predictions.",

The algorithm overcomes the limitations of Algorithm 644, which is restricted to double precision and applies overly conservative underflow and overflow thresholds, leading to failures in large parameter regions. Accuracy is validated against high-precision Maple calculations, and benchmarking shows execution time reductions to 54%-80% of Algorithm 644 (in double precision). Quad precision enhances numerical stability and broadens the domain of computations, making the implementation well suited for high-precision applications in physics and engineering.

    "summary": "Isogeometric analysis (IGA) enables exact representations of computational geometries and higher-order approximation of PDEs. In non-smooth domains, however, singularities near corners limit the effectiveness of IGA, since standard methods typically fail to achieve optimal convergence rates. These constraints can be addressed through local mesh refinement, but existing approaches require breaking the tensor-product structure of splines, which leads to increased implementation complexity.\nThis work introduces a novel local refinement strategy based on a polar parameterization, in which one edge of the parametric square is collapsed into the corner. By grading the standard mesh toward the collapsing edge, the desired locality near the singularity is obtained while maintaining the tensor-product structure. A mathematical analysis and numerical tests show that the resulting isogeometric approximation achieves optimal convergence rates with suitable grading parameters.\nPolar parameterizations, however, suffer from a lack of regularity at the polar point, making existing standard isogeometric approximation theory inapplicable. To address this, a new framework is developed for deriving error estimates on polar domains with corners. This involves the construction of polar function spaces on the parametric domain and a modified projection operator onto the space of $C^0$-smooth polar splines. The theoretical results are verified by numerical experiments confirming both the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach.",

The DHMC was proposed in [Biometrika, 107(2)] for discontinuous potential where the variable has a fixed dimension. When the dimension changes, there is no clear explanation of the volume-preserving property, and the conservation of energy is also not necessary. We use a random sampling for the extra dimensions, which corresponds to a measure transform. We show that when the energy is corrected suitably for the trans-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics, the detailed balance condition is then satisfied. For the grand canonical ensemble, such a procedure can be explained very naturally to be the extra free energy change brought by the newly added particles, which justifies the rationality of our approach. To sample the grand canonical ensemble for interacting particle systems, the DHMC is then combined with the random batch method to yield an efficient sampling method. In experiments, we show that the proposed DHMC combined with the random batch method generates samples with much less correlation when compared with the traditional Metropolis-Hastings method.",

    "summary": "The Riemannian manifold of curves with a Sobolev metric is an important and frequently studied model in the theory of shape spaces. Various numerical approaches have been proposed to compute geodesics, but so far elude a rigorous convergence theory. By a slick modification of a temporal Galerkin discretization we manage to preserve coercivity and compactness properties of the continuous model and thereby are able to prove convergence for the geodesic boundary value problem. Likewise, for the numerical analysis of the geodesic initial value problem we are able to exploit the geodesic completeness of the underlying continuous model for the error control of a time-stepping approximation. In fact, we develop a convergent discretization of a comprehensive Riemannian calculus that in addition includes parallel transport, covariant differentiation, the Riemann curvature tensor, and sectional curvature, all important tools to explore the geometry of the space of curves. Selected numerical examples confirm the theoretical findings and show the qualitative behaviour. To this end, a low-dimensional submanifold of Sobolev curves with explicit formulas for ground truth covariant derivatives and curvatures are considered.",

    "summary": "We show that a broad range of convex optimization algorithms, including alternating projection, operator splitting, and multiplier methods, can be systematically derived from the framework of subspace correction methods via convex duality. To formalize this connection, we introduce the notion of dualization, a process that transforms an iterative method for the dual problem into an equivalent method for the primal problem. This concept establishes new connections across these algorithmic classes, encompassing both well-known and new methods. In particular, we show that classical algorithms such as the von Neumann, Dykstra, Peaceman--Rachford, and Douglas--Rachford methods can be interpreted as dualizations of subspace correction methods applied to appropriate dual formulations. Beyond unifying existing methods, our framework enables the systematic development of new algorithms for convex optimization. For instance, we derive parallel variants of alternating projection and operator splitting methods, as dualizations of parallel subspace correction methods, that are well-suited for large-scale problems on modern computing architectures and offer straightforward convergence guarantees. We also propose new alternating direction method of multipliers-type algorithms, derived as dualizations of certain operator splitting methods. These algorithms naturally ensure convergence even in the multi-block setting, where the conventional method does not guarantee convergence when applied to more than two blocks. This unified perspective not only facilitates algorithm design and the transfer of theoretical results but also opens new avenues for research and innovation in convex optimization.",

    "summary": "Fiber orientation is an important descriptor of the microstructure for short fiber polymer composite materials where accurate and efficient prediction of the orientation state is crucial when evaluating the bulk thermo-mechanical response of the material. Recent macroscopic fiber orientation models have employed the moment-tensor form in representing the fiber orientation state which all require a closure approximation for the higher order orientation tensors. In addition, various models have been developed to account for rotary diffusion due to fiber-fiber and fiber-matrix interactions which can now more accurately simulate the experimentally observed slow fiber kinematics in polymer composite processing. Traditionally explicit numerical IVP-ODE transient solvers like the 4th order Runge-Kutta method have been used to predict the steady-state fiber orientation state. Here we propose a computationally efficient method based on the Newton-Raphson iterative technique for determining steady state orientation tensor values by evaluating the exact derivatives of the moment-tensor evolution equation with respect to the independent components of the orientation tensor. We consider various existing macroscopic fiber orientation models and several closure ap-proximations to ensure the robustness and reliability of the method. The performance and stability of the approach for obtaining physical solutions in various homogeneous flow fields is demonstrated through several examples. Validation of the obtained exact derivatives of the orientation tensor is performed by benchmarking with results of finite difference techniques",

    "summary": "This paper presents a novel quasi-3D theory and the corresponding mixed beam element model to achieve accurate solutions for functionally graded beams. The key innovations include the development of equilibrium-based stress expressions, the modified cross-sectional stiffness matrix, and the mixed beam element model based on semi-analytical definition of internal force fields. In contrast to the conventional quasi-3D theory where stress expressions are derived from constitutive equations and geometric relations, the stress expressions in this study are derived from the differential equilibrium equations among stresses, ensuring strict adherence of stress solutions to equilibrium conditions. To incorporate the influence of equilibrium-derived stress distributions, the modified cross-sectional stiffness matrix is derived, enhancing the theoretical and practical feasibility of the beam model. For beam element construction, the mixed variational principle of two-field variables is employed, with generalized internal forces and generalized displacements regarded as two independent fields. Especially, semi-analytical internal force fields, which partially satisfy the differential equilibrium equations, are introduced to improve the element performance. Numerical examples are conducted to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed theory and beam element.",

The survey has two parts. The first considers incorporating physics knowledge on an architectural level through objective functions, structured predictive models, and data augmentation. The second considers data as physics knowledge, which motivates looking at multi-task, meta, and contextual learning as an alternative approach to incorporating physics knowledge in a data-driven fashion.

    "summary": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are localized dilatations of the abdominal aorta that can lead to life-threatening rupture if left untreated. AAAs primarily affect older individuals, with high mortality rates following rupture, so early diagnosis and risk assessment are critical. The geometrical characteristics of an AAA, such as its maximum diameter, asymmetry, and wall thickness, are extremely significant in biomechanical models for the assessment of rupture risk. Despite the growing use of computational modeling for AAA investigation, there is a notable gap in accessible, open-source software capable of generating simulation-ready geometries for biomechanical and hemodynamic simulations. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{AneuPy}, an open-source Python-based tool designed to create both idealized and patient-specific AAA geometric models. \\textbf{AneuPy} is a fast and automated approach for generating aneurysm geometries from minimal input data, allowing for extensive parameter customization. By automating the creation of simulation-ready geometries for finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), or fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models, \\textbf{AneuPy} can facilitate research in AAA and improve patient-specific risk prediction.",

    "summary": "Multimodal learning enhances the perceptual capabilities of cognitive systems by integrating information from different sensory modalities. However, existing multimodal fusion research typically assumes static integration, not fully incorporating key dynamic mechanisms found in the brain. Specifically, the brain exhibits an inverse effectiveness phenomenon, wherein weaker unimodal cues yield stronger multisensory integration benefits; conversely, when individual modal cues are stronger, the effect of fusion is diminished. This mechanism enables biological systems to achieve robust cognition even with scarce or noisy perceptual cues. Inspired by this biological mechanism, we explore the relationship between multimodal output and information from individual modalities, proposing an inverse effectiveness driven multimodal fusion (IEMF) strategy. By incorporating this strategy into neural networks, we achieve more efficient integration with improved model performance and computational efficiency, demonstrating up to 50% reduction in computational cost across diverse fusion methods. We conduct experiments on audio-visual classification, continual learning, and question answering tasks to validate our method. Results consistently demonstrate that our method performs excellently in these tasks. To verify universality and generalization, we also conduct experiments on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), with results showing good adaptability to both network types. Our research emphasizes the potential of incorporating biologically inspired mechanisms into multimodal networks and provides promising directions for the future development of multimodal artificial intelligence.

    "summary": "The Spiking Neural Network (SNN) has drawn increasing attention for its energy-efficient, event-driven processing and biological plausibility. To train SNNs via backpropagation, surrogate gradients are used to approximate the non-differentiable spike function, but they only maintain nonzero derivatives within a narrow range of membrane potentials near the firing threshold, referred to as the surrogate gradient support width gamma. We identify a major challenge, termed the dilemma of gamma: a relatively large gamma leads to overactivation, characterized by excessive neuron firing, which in turn increases energy consumption, whereas a small gamma causes vanishing gradients and weakens temporal dependencies. To address this, we propose a temporal Inhibitory Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ILIF) neuron model, inspired by biological inhibitory mechanisms. This model incorporates interconnected inhibitory units for membrane potential and current, effectively mitigating overactivation while preserving gradient propagation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates ILIF effectiveness in overcoming the gamma dilemma, and extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that ILIF improves energy efficiency by reducing firing rates, stabilizes training, and enhances accuracy.

    "summary": "The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have led to the emergence of quantum machine learning (QML), which integrates the strengths of both fields. Among QML approaches, variational quantum circuits (VQCs), also known as quantum neural networks (QNNs), have shown promise both empirically and theoretically. However, their broader adoption is hindered by reliance on quantum hardware during inference. Hardware imperfections and limited access to quantum devices pose practical challenges. To address this, the Quantum-Train (QT) framework leverages the exponential scaling of quantum amplitudes to generate classical neural network parameters, enabling inference without quantum hardware and achieving significant parameter compression. Yet, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for such quantum-enhanced neural programmers remains non-trivial and often requires expertise in quantum information science. In this paper, we propose an automated solution using differentiable optimization. Our method jointly optimizes both conventional circuit parameters and architectural parameters in an end-to-end manner via automatic differentiation. We evaluate the proposed framework on classification, time-series prediction, and reinforcement learning tasks. Simulation results show that our method matches or outperforms manually designed QNN architectures. This work offers a scalable and automated pathway for designing QNNs that can generate classical neural network parameters across diverse applications.",

Drawing inspiration from annealing-based algorithms, we treat the black-box objective as an energy function and train a neural network to model the associated Boltzmann distribution. By conditioning on temperature, the network captures a continuum of distributions--from near-uniform at high temperatures to sharply peaked around global optima at low temperatures--thereby learning the structure of the energy landscape and facilitating global optimization. When queries are expensive, the temperature-dependent distributions naturally enable data augmentation and improve sample efficiency. When queries are cheap but the problem remains hard, the model learns implicit variable interactions, effectively \"opening\" the black box. We validate our approach on challenging combinatorial tasks under both limited and unlimited query budgets, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art black-box optimizers.",

We systematically study the activity of RNNs with random weights drawn from biologically plausible L√©vy alpha-stable distributions. While mean-field theory for the infinite system predicts that the quiescent state is always unstable -- implying ubiquitous chaos -- our finite-size analysis reveals a sharp transition between quiescent and chaotic dynamics. We theoretically predict the gain at which the system transitions from quiescent to chaotic dynamics, and validate it through simulations. Compared to Gaussian networks, heavy-tailed RNNs exhibit a broader parameter regime near the edge of chaos, namely a slow transition to chaos. However, this robustness comes with a tradeoff: heavier tails reduce the Lyapunov dimension of the attractor, indicating lower effective dimensionality. Our results reveal a biologically aligned tradeoff between the robustness of dynamics near the edge of chaos and the richness of high-dimensional neural activity. By analytically characterizing the transition point in finite-size networks -- where mean-field theory breaks down -- we provide a tractable framework for understanding dynamics in realistically sized, heavy-tailed neural circuits.",

    "summary": "Scrambling quantum systems have been demonstrated as effective substrates for temporal information processing. While their role in providing rich feature maps has been widely studied, a theoretical understanding of their performance in temporal tasks is still lacking. Here we consider a general quantum reservoir processing framework that captures a broad range of physical computing models with quantum systems. We examine the scalability and memory retention of the model with scrambling reservoirs modelled by high-order unitary designs in both noiseless and noisy settings. In the former regime, we show that measurement readouts become exponentially concentrated with increasing reservoir size, yet strikingly do not worsen with the reservoir iterations. Thus, while repeatedly reusing a small scrambling reservoir with quantum data might be viable, scaling up the problem size deteriorates generalization unless one can afford an exponential shot overhead. In contrast, the memory of early inputs and initial states decays exponentially in both reservoir size and reservoir iterations. In the noisy regime, we also prove exponential memory decays with iterations for local noisy channels. Proving these results required us to introduce new proof techniques for bounding concentration in temporal quantum learning models.",

It is well-suited for optimizing functions with more than three objectives, setting it apart from the classic NSGA-II. However, theoretical insights about NSGA-III of when and why it performs well are still in its early development. This paper addresses this point and conducts a rigorous runtime analysis of NSGA-III on the many-objective \\textsc{OneJumpZeroJump} benchmark (\\textsc{OjZj} for short), providing the first runtime bounds where the number of objectives is constant. We show that NSGA-III finds the Pareto front of \\textsc{OjZj} in time $O(n^{k+d/2}+ \\mu n \\ln(n))$ where $n$ is the problem size, $d$ is the number of objectives, $k$ is the gap size, a problem specific parameter, if its population size $\\mu \\in 2^{O(n)}$ is at least $(2n/d+1)^{d/2}$. Notably, NSGA-III is faster than NSGA-II by a factor of $\\mu/n^{d/2}$ for some $\\mu \\in \\omega(n^{d/2})$. We also show that a stochastic population update, proposed by Bian et al., provably guarantees a speedup of order $\\Theta((k/b)^{k-1})$ in the runtime where $b>0$ is a constant. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous runtime analysis of NSGA-III on \\textsc{OjZj}.

    "summary": "Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) rely on Deep Neural Networks, allowing vehicles to navigate complex, open environments. However, the unpredictability of these scenarios highlights the need for rigorous system-level testing to ensure safety, a task usually performed with a simulator in the loop. Though one important goal of such testing is to detect safety violations, there are many undesirable system behaviors, that may not immediately lead to violations, that testing should also be focusing on, thus detecting more subtle problems and enabling a finer-grained analysis. This paper introduces Cooperative Co-evolutionary MEtamorphic test Generator for Autonomous systems (CoCoMEGA), a novel automated testing framework aimed at advancing system-level safety assessments of ADSs. CoCoMEGA combines Metamorphic Testing (MT) with a search-based approach utilizing Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Algorithms (CCEA) to efficiently generate a diverse set of test cases. CoCoMEGA emphasizes the identification of test scenarios that present undesirable system behavior, that may eventually lead to safety violations, captured by Metamorphic Relations (MRs). When evaluated within the CARLA simulation environment on the Interfuser ADS, CoCoMEGA consistently outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness and efficiency in generating severe, diverse MR violations and achieving broader exploration of the test space. These results underscore CoCoMEGA as a promising, more scalable solution to the inherent challenges in ADS testing with a simulator in the loop. Future research directions may include extending the approach to additional simulation platforms, applying it to other complex systems, and exploring methods for further improving testing efficiency such as surrogate modeling.",

This NP-hard problem is fundamental to network virtualization, embodying essential properties of resource allocation problems faced by service providers in the edge-to-cloud spectrum. Due to its centrality, this problem and its variants have been extensively studied and remain in the focus of the research community.\nIn this paper, we present a new variant, the virtual network embedding with alternatives problem (VNEAP). This new problem captures the power of a common network virtualization practice, in which virtual network topologies are malleable - embedding of a given virtual network instance can be performed using any of the alternatives from a given set of topology alternatives. We provide two efficient heuristics for VNEAP and show that having multiple virtual network alternatives for the same application is superior to the best results known for the classic formulation. We conclude that capturing the problem domain via VNEAP can facilitate more efficient network virtualization solutions.",

    "summary": "In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wake-up radio (WuR)-enabled internet of things (IoT) networks, UAVs can instantly activate the main radios (MRs) of the sensor nodes (SNs) with a wake-up call (WuC) for efficient data collection in mission-driven data collection scenarios. However, the spontaneous response of numerous SNs to the UAV's WuC can lead to significant packet loss and collisions, as WuR does not exhibit its superiority for high-traffic loads. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative receiver-initiated WuR UAV-assisted clustering (RI-WuR-UAC) medium access control (MAC) protocol to achieve low latency and high reliability in ultra-low power consumption applications. We model the proposed protocol using the $M/G/1/2$ queuing framework and derive expressions for key performance metrics, i.e., channel busyness probability, probability of successful clustering, average SN energy consumption, and average transmission delay. The RI-WuR-UAC protocol employs three distinct data flow models, tailored to different network traffic conditions, which perform three MAC mechanisms: channel assessment (CCA) clustering for light traffic loads, backoff plus CCA clustering for dense and heavy traffic, and adaptive clustering for variable traffic loads. Simulation results demonstrate that the RI-WuR-UAC protocol significantly outperforms the benchmark sub-carrier modulation clustering protocol. By varying the network load, we capture the trade-offs among the performance metrics, showcasing the superior efficiency and reliability of the RI-WuR-UAC protocol.",

    "summary": "Visible Light Communication (VLC) provides an energy-efficient wireless solution by using existing LED-based illumination for high-speed data transmissions. Although solar cells offer the advantage of simultaneous energy harvesting and data reception, their broadband nature hinders accurate decoding of color-coded signals like Color Shift Keying (CSK). In this paper, we propose a novel approach exploiting the concept of tandem solar cells, multi-layer devices with partial wavelength selectivity, to capture coarse color information without resorting to energy-limiting color filters. To address the residual spectral overlap, we develop a bidirectional LSTM-based machine learning framework that infers channel characteristics by comparing solar cells' photovoltaic signals with pilot-based anchor data. Our commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solar prototype achieves robust performance across varying distances and ambient lighting levels, significantly reducing bit error rates compared to conventional channel estimation methods. These findings mark a step toward sustainable, high-performance VLC systems powered by the multi-layer solar technologies.",

    "summary": "The O-RAN architecture is transforming cellular networks by adopting RAN softwarization and disaggregation concepts to enable data-driven monitoring and control of the network. Such management is enabled by RICs, which facilitate near-real-time and non-real-time network control through xApps and rApps. However, they face limitations, including latency overhead in data exchange between the RAN and RIC, restricting real-time monitoring, and the inability to access user plain data due to privacy and security constraints, hindering use cases like beamforming and spectrum classification. In this paper, we leverage the dApps concept to enable real-time RF spectrum classification with LibIQ, a novel library for RF signals that facilitates efficient spectrum monitoring and signal classification by providing functionalities to read I/Q samples as time-series, create datasets and visualize time-series data through plots and spectrograms. Thanks to LibIQ, I/Q samples can be efficiently processed to detect external RF signals, which are subsequently classified using a CNN inside the library. To achieve accurate spectrum analysis, we created an extensive dataset of time-series-based I/Q samples, representing distinct signal types captured using a custom dApp running on a 5G deployment over the Colosseum network emulator and an OTA testbed. We evaluate our model by deploying LibIQ in heterogeneous scenarios with varying center frequencies, time windows, and external RF signals. In real-time analysis, the model classifies the processed I/Q samples, achieving an average accuracy of approximately 97.8\\% in identifying signal types across all scenarios. We pledge to release both LibIQ and the dataset created as a publicly available framework upon acceptance.",

    "summary": "Scheduling All-to-All communications efficiently is fundamental to minimizing job completion times in distributed systems. Incast and straggler flows can slow down All-to-All transfers; and GPU clusters bring additional straggler challenges due to highly heterogeneous link capacities between technologies like NVLink and Ethernet. Existing schedulers all suffer high overheads relative to theoretically optimal transfers. Classical, simple scheduling algorithms such as SpreadOut fail to minimize transfer completion times; modern optimization-based schedulers such as TACCL achieve better completion times but with computation times that can be orders of magnitude longer than the transfer itself. This paper presents FLASH, which schedules near-optimal All-to-All transfers with a simple, polynomial time algorithm. FLASH keeps the bottleneck inter-server network maximally utilized and, in the background, shuffles data between GPUs over fast intra-server networks to mitigate stragglers. We prove that, so long as intra-server networks are significantly faster than inter-server networks, FLASH approaches near-optimal transfer completion times. We implement FLASH and demonstrate that its computational overheads are negligible, yet it achieves transfer completion times that are comparable to state-of-the-art solver-based schedulers.",

Our deployment right-sizing strategy makes it economically viable to deploy more than 6 million high-end GPUs today that could consume cheap, green power at its source. We built Heron, a cross-site software router, that could efficiently leverage the complementarity of power generation across wind farms by routing AI inferencing workload around power drops. Using 1-week ofcoding and conversation production traces from Azure and (real) variable wind power traces, we show how Heron improves aggregate goodput of AI compute by up to 80% compared to the state-of-the-art.",

    "summary": "Vehicle platooning, with vehicles traveling in close formation coordinated through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, offers significant benefits in fuel efficiency and road utilization. However, it is vulnerable to sophisticated falsification attacks by authenticated insiders that can destabilize the formation and potentially cause catastrophic collisions. This paper addresses this challenge: misbehavior detection in vehicle platooning systems. We present AttentionGuard, a transformer-based framework for misbehavior detection that leverages the self-attention mechanism to identify anomalous patterns in mobility data. Our proposal employs a multi-head transformer-encoder to process sequential kinematic information, enabling effective differentiation between normal mobility patterns and falsification attacks across diverse platooning scenarios, including steady-state (no-maneuver) operation, join, and exit maneuvers. Our evaluation uses an extensive simulation dataset featuring various attack vectors (constant, gradual, and combined falsifications) and operational parameters (controller types, vehicle speeds, and attacker positions). Experimental results demonstrate that AttentionGuard achieves up to 0.95 F1-score in attack detection, with robust performance maintained during complex maneuvers. Notably, our system performs effectively with minimal latency (100ms decision intervals), making it suitable for real-time transportation safety applications. Comparative analysis reveals superior detection capabilities and establishes the transformer-encoder as a promising approach for securing Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) against sophisticated insider threats.",

    "summary": "Due to their ability to anchor into tall urban landforms, such as lampposts or street lights, robotic aerial base stations (RABSs) can create a hyper-flexible wireless multi-hop heterogeneous network to meet the forthcoming green, densified, and dynamic network deployment to support, inter alia, high data rates. In this work, we propose a network infrastructure that can concurrently support the wireless backhaul link capacity and access link traffic demand in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. The RABSs grasping locations, resource blocks (RBs) assignment, and route flow control are simultaneously optimized to maximize the served traffic demands. Robotic base stations capitalize on the fact that traffic distribution varies considerably across both time and space within a given geographical area. Hence, they are able to relocate to suitable locations, i.e., 'follow' the traffic demand as it unfolds to increase the overall network efficiency. To tackle the curse of dimensionality of the proposed mixed-integer linear problem, we propose a greedy algorithm to obtain a competitive solution with low computational complexity. Compared to baseline models, which are heterogeneous networks with randomly deployed fixed small cells and pre-allocated RBs for wireless access and backhaul links, a wide set of numerical investigations reveals that robotic base stations could improve the served traffic demand. Specifically, the proposed mode serves at most 65\\% more traffic demand compared to an equal number of deployed fixed small cells.",

    "summary": "Space-ground integrated networks hold great promise for providing global connectivity, particularly in remote areas where large amounts of valuable data are generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, but lacking terrestrial communication infrastructure. The massive data is conventionally transferred to the cloud server for centralized artificial intelligence (AI) models training, raising huge communication overhead and privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a hierarchical learning and computing framework, which leverages the lowlatency characteristic of low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites and the global coverage of geostationary-earth-orbit (GEO) satellites, to provide global aggregation services for locally trained models on ground IoT devices. Due to the time-varying nature of satellite network topology and the energy constraints of LEO satellites, efficiently aggregating the received local models from ground devices on LEO satellites is highly challenging. By leveraging the predictability of inter-satellite connectivity, modeling the space network as a directed graph, we formulate a network energy minimization problem for model aggregation, which turns out to be a Directed Steiner Tree (DST) problem. We propose a topologyaware energy-efficient routing (TAEER) algorithm to solve the DST problem by finding a minimum spanning arborescence on a substitute directed graph. Extensive simulations under realworld space-ground integrated network settings demonstrate that the proposed TAEER algorithm significantly reduces energy consumption and outperforms benchmarks.",

    "summary": "Graph neural networks are gaining attention in fifth-generation (5G) core network digital twins, which are data-driven complex systems with numerous components. Analyzing these data can be challenging due to rare failure types, leading to imbalanced classification in multiclass settings. Digital twins of 5G networks increasingly employ graph classification as the main method for identifying failure types. However, the skewed distribution of failure occurrences is a significant class-imbalance problem that prevents practical graph data mining. Previous studies have not sufficiently addressed this complex problem. This paper, proposes class-Fourier GNN (CF-GNN) that introduces a class-oriented spectral filtering mechanism to ensure precise classification by estimating a unique spectral filter for each class. This work employs eigenvalue and eigenvector spectral filtering to capture and adapt to variations in minority classes, ensuring accurate class-specific feature discrimination, and adept at graph representation learning for complex local structures among neighbors in an end-to-end setting. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CF-GNN could help create new techniques for enhancing classifiers and investigate the characteristics of the multiclass imbalanced data in a network digital twin system.",

These systems come with the system-software challenge that the intermittently powered IoT devices have to checkpoint their state in non-volatile memory to later resume with this state when sufficient energy is available. The scarce energy resources demand that only modified data is persisted before a power failure, which requires precise modification tracking.\nWe present vNV-Heap, the first ownership-based virtually Non-Volatile Heap for intermittently powered systems with guaranteed power-failure resilience. The heap exploits ownership systems, a zero-cost (i.e., compile-time) abstraction for example implemented by Rust, to track modifications and virtualize object persistence. To achieve power-failure resilience, our heap is designed and implemented to guarantee bounded operations by static program code analysis: For example, the heap allows for determining a worst-case energy consumption for the operation of persisting modified and currently volatile objects. The evaluation of our open-source implementation on an embedded hardware platform (i.e., ESP32-C3) shows that using our heap abstraction is more energy efficient than existing approaches while also providing runtime guarantees by static worst-case bounds.",

Using the Gramine library OS as a representative enclave runtime environment, this paper shows how to recover EDMM performance.

Surrogate models may allow for the accelerated evaluation of CPMs of complex biological systems. However, the stochastic nature of these models means each set of parameters may give rise to different model configurations, complicating surrogate model development. In this work, we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models to train a generative AI surrogate of a CPM used to investigate \\textit{in vitro} vasculogenesis. We describe the use of an image classifier to learn the characteristics that define unique areas of a 2-dimensional parameter space. We then apply this classifier to aid in surrogate model selection and verification. Our CPM model surrogate generates model configurations 20,000 timesteps ahead of a reference configuration and demonstrates approximately a 22x reduction in computational time as compared to native code execution. Our work represents a step towards the implementation of DDPMs to develop digital twins of stochastic biological systems.",

    "summary": "The burgeoning RISC-V ecosystem necessitates efficient verification methodologies for complex processors. Traditional approaches often struggle to concurrently evaluate functional correctness and performance, or balance simulation speed with modeling accuracy. This paper introduces an integrated co-simulation framework leveraging Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) and Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM) for RISC-V processor validation. We present a configurable UVM-TLM model (vmodel) of a superscalar, out-of-order RISC-V core, featuring key microarchitectural modeling techniques such as credit-based pipeline flow control. This environment facilitates unified functional verification via co-simulation against the Spike ISA simulator and enables early-stage performance assessment using benchmarks like CoreMark, orchestrated within UVM. The methodology prioritizes integration, simulation efficiency, and acceptable fidelity for architectural exploration over cycle-level precision. Experimental results validate functional correctness and significant simulation speedup over RTL approaches, accelerating design iterations and enhancing verification coverage.",

    "summary": "With recent algorithmic improvements and easy-to-use libraries, equality saturation is being picked up for hardware design, program synthesis, theorem proving, program optimization, and more. Existing work on using equality saturation for program optimization makes use of external equality saturation libraries such as egg, typically generating a single optimized expression. In the context of a compiler, such an approach uses equality saturation to replace a small number of passes. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that represents equality saturation natively in the compiler's intermediate representation, facilitating the application of constructive compiler passes that maintain the e-graph state throughout the compilation flow. We take LLVM's MLIR framework and propose a new MLIR dialect named eqsat that represents e-graphs in MLIR code. This not only provides opportunities to rethink e-matching and extraction techniques by orchestrating existing MLIR passes, such as common subexpression elimination, but also avoids translation overhead between the chosen e-graph library and MLIR. Our eqsat intermediate representation (IR) allows programmers to apply equality saturation on arbitrary domain-specific IRs using the same flow as other compiler transformations in MLIR.",

    "summary": "Python demonstrates lower performance in comparison to traditional high performance computing (HPC) languages such as C, C++, and Fortran. This performance gap is largely due to Python's interpreted nature and the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which hampers multithreading efficiency. However, the latest version of Python includes the necessary changes to make the interpreter thread-safe, allowing Python code to run without the GIL. This important update will enable users to fully exploit multithreading parallelism in Python. In order to facilitate that task, this paper introduces OMP4Py, the first pure Python implementation of OpenMP. We demonstrate that it is possible to bring OpenMP's familiar directive-based parallelization paradigm to Python, allowing developers to write parallel code with the same level of control and flexibility as in C, C++, or Fortran. The experimental evaluation shows that OMP4Py significantly impacts the performance of various types of applications, although the current threading limitation of Python's interpreter (v3.13) reduce its effectiveness for numerical applications.",

These systems come with the system-software challenge that the intermittently powered IoT devices have to checkpoint their state in non-volatile memory to later resume with this state when sufficient energy is available. The scarce energy resources demand that only modified data is persisted before a power failure, which requires precise modification tracking.\nWe present vNV-Heap, the first ownership-based virtually Non-Volatile Heap for intermittently powered systems with guaranteed power-failure resilience. The heap exploits ownership systems, a zero-cost (i.e., compile-time) abstraction for example implemented by Rust, to track modifications and virtualize object persistence. To achieve power-failure resilience, our heap is designed and implemented to guarantee bounded operations by static program code analysis: For example, the heap allows for determining a worst-case energy consumption for the operation of persisting modified and currently volatile objects. The evaluation of our open-source implementation on an embedded hardware platform (i.e., ESP32-C3) shows that using our heap abstraction is more energy efficient than existing approaches while also providing runtime guarantees by static worst-case bounds.",

    "summary": "The Spectre speculative side-channel attacks pose formidable threats for security. Research has shown that code following the cryptographic constant-time discipline can be efficiently protected against Spectre v1 using a selective variant of Speculative Load Hardening (SLH). SLH was, however, not strong enough for protecting non-cryptographic code, leading to the introduction of Ultimate SLH, which provides protection for arbitrary programs, but has too large overhead for general use, since it conservatively assumes that all data is secret. In this paper we introduce a flexible SLH notion that achieves the best of both worlds by generalizing both Selective and Ultimate SLH. We give a suitable security definition for such transformations protecting arbitrary programs: any transformed program running with speculation should not leak more than what the source program leaks sequentially. We formally prove using the Rocq prover that two flexible SLH variants enforce this relative security guarantee. As easy corollaries we also obtain that, in our setting, Ultimate SLH enforces our relative security notion, and two selective SLH variants enforce speculative constant-time security.",

Today's reliance on a single dominant platform limits portability, creates vendor lock-in, and raises barriers for new AI hardware. In this work, we make the case for combining just-in-time (JIT) compilation with kernel parameter autotuning to enable portable LLM inference with state-of-the-art performance without code changes. Focusing on flash attention -- a widespread performance critical LLM kernel -- we demonstrate that this approach explores up to 15x more kernel parameter configurations, produces significantly more diverse code across multiple dimensions, and even outperforms vendor-optimized implementations by up to 230%, all while reducing kernel code size by 70x and eliminating manual code optimizations. Our results highlight autotuning as a promising path to unlocking model portability across GPU vendors.",

Building on these developments, text-to-video diffusion models have evolved into embodied world models (EWMs) capable of generating physically plausible scenes from language commands, effectively bridging vision and action in embodied AI applications. This work addresses the critical challenge of evaluating EWMs beyond general perceptual metrics to ensure the generation of physically grounded and action-consistent behaviors. We propose the Embodied World Model Benchmark (EWMBench), a dedicated framework designed to evaluate EWMs based on three key aspects: visual scene consistency, motion correctness, and semantic alignment. Our approach leverages a meticulously curated dataset encompassing diverse scenes and motion patterns, alongside a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation toolkit, to assess and compare candidate models. The proposed benchmark not only identifies the limitations of existing video generation models in meeting the unique requirements of embodied tasks but also provides valuable insights to guide future advancements in the field.

In robotic manipulation, VLMs are used primarily as high-level planners, but recent work has also studied their lower-level reasoning ability, which refers to making decisions about precise robot movements. However, the community currently lacks a clear and common benchmark that can evaluate how well VLMs can aid low-level reasoning in robotics. Consequently, we propose a novel benchmark, ManipBench, to evaluate the low-level robot manipulation reasoning capabilities of VLMs across various dimensions, including how well they understand object-object interactions and deformable object manipulation. We extensively test 33 representative VLMs across 10 model families on our benchmark, including variants to test different model sizes. Our evaluation shows that the performance of VLMs significantly varies across tasks, and there is a strong correlation between this performance and trends in our real-world manipulation tasks. It also shows that there remains a significant gap between these models and human-level understanding. See our website at: this https URL.",

With fine-tuning, VLMs can also natively produce robot trajectories. We demonstrate that eliciting wrenches, not trajectories, allows VLMs to explicitly reason about forces and leads to zero-shot generalization in a series of manipulation tasks without pretraining. We achieve this by overlaying a consistent visual representation of relevant coordinate frames on robot-attached camera images to augment our query. First, we show how this addition enables a versatile motion control framework evaluated across four tasks (opening and closing a lid, pushing a cup or chair) spanning prismatic and rotational motion, an order of force and position magnitude, different camera perspectives, annotation schemes, and two robot platforms over 220 experiments, resulting in 51% success across the four tasks. Then, we demonstrate that the proposed framework enables VLMs to continually reason about interaction feedback to recover from task failure or incompletion, with and without human supervision. Finally, we observe that prompting schemes with visual annotation and embodied reasoning can bypass VLM safeguards. We characterize prompt component contribution to harmful behavior elicitation and discuss its implications for developing embodied reasoning.

    "summary": "Modern robots face challenges shared by humans, where machines must learn multiple sensorimotor skills and express them adaptively. Equipping robots with a human-like memory of how it feels to do multiple stereotypical movements can make robots more aware of normal operational states and help develop self-preserving safer robots. Associative Skill Memories (ASMs) aim to address this by linking movement primitives to sensory feedback, but existing implementations rely on hard-coded libraries of individual skills. A key unresolved problem is how a single neural network can learn a repertoire of skills while enabling fault detection and context-aware execution. Here we introduce Neural Associative Skill Memories (ASMs), a framework that utilises self-supervised predictive coding for temporal prediction to unify skill learning and expression, using biologically plausible learning rules. Unlike traditional ASMs which require explicit skill selection, Neural ASMs implicitly recognize and express skills through contextual inference, enabling fault detection across learned behaviours without an explicit skill selection mechanism. Compared to recurrent neural networks trained via backpropagation through time, our model achieves comparable qualitative performance in skill memory expression while using local learning rules and predicts a biologically relevant speed-accuracy trade-off during skill memory expression. This work advances the field of neurorobotics by demonstrating how predictive coding principles can model adaptive robot control and human motor preparation. By unifying fault detection, reactive control, skill memorisation and expression into a single energy-based architecture, Neural ASMs contribute to safer robotics and provide a computational lens to study biological sensorimotor learning.",

Mounted on a standard parallel jaw actuator, the design features three narrow, tapered fingers arranged in a two-against-one configuration, where the two fingers converge into a V-shape. The GET gripper is more capable of conforming to object geometries and forming secure grasps than traditional designs with two flat fingers. Inspired by the principle of self-similarity, these V-shaped fingers enable secure grasping across a wide range of object sizes. Further to this end, fingers are parametrically designed for convenient resizing and interchangeability across robotic embodiments with a parallel jaw gripper. Additionally, we incorporate a rigid fingernail to enhance small object manipulation. Tactile sensing can be integrated into the standalone finger via an externally-mounted camera. A neural network was trained to estimate normal force from tactile images with an average validation error of 1.3~N across a diverse set of geometries. In grasping 15 objects and performing 3 tasks via teleoperation, the GET fingers consistently outperformed standard flat fingers.

    "summary": "Neural displacement priors (NDP) can reduce the drift in inertial odometry and provide uncertainty estimates that can be readily fused with off-the-shelf filters. However, they fail to generalize to different IMU sampling rates and trajectory profiles, which limits their robustness in diverse settings. To address this challenge, we replace the traditional NDP inputs comprising raw IMU data with Lie events that are robust to input rate changes and have favorable invariances when observed under different trajectory profiles. Unlike raw IMU data sampled at fixed rates, Lie events are sampled whenever the norm of the IMU pre-integration change, mapped to the Lie algebra of the SE(3) group, exceeds a threshold. Inspired by event-based vision, we generalize the notion of level-crossing on 1D signals to level-crossings on the Lie algebra and generalize binary polarities to normalized Lie polarities within this algebra. We show that training NDPs on Lie events incorporating these polarities reduces the trajectory error of off-the-shelf downstream inertial odometry methods by up to 21% with only minimal preprocessing. We conjecture that many more sensors than IMUs or cameras can benefit from an event-based sampling paradigm and that this work makes an important first step in this direction.",

    "summary": "In the context of mobile navigation in unstructured environments, the predominant approach entails the avoidance of obstacles. The prevailing path planning algorithms are contingent upon deviating from the intended path for an indefinite duration and returning to the closest point on the route after the obstacle is left behind spatially. However, avoiding an obstacle on a path that will be used repeatedly by multiple agents can hinder long-term efficiency and lead to a lasting reliance on an active path planning system. In this study, we propose an alternative approach to mobile navigation in unstructured environments by leveraging the manipulation capabilities of a robotic manipulator mounted on top of a mobile robot. Our proposed framework integrates exteroceptive and proprioceptive feedback to assess the push affordance of obstacles, facilitating their repositioning rather than avoidance. While our preliminary visual estimation takes into account the characteristics of both the obstacle and the surface it relies on, the push affordance estimation module exploits the force feedback obtained by interacting with the obstacle via a robotic manipulator as the guidance signal. The objective of our navigation approach is to enhance the efficiency of routes utilized by multiple agents over extended periods by reducing the overall time spent by a fleet in environments where autonomous infrastructure development is imperative, such as lunar or Martian surfaces.",

    "summary": "In industrial automation, radar is a critical sensor in machine perception. However, the angular resolution of radar is inherently limited by the Rayleigh criterion, which depends on both the radar's operating wavelength and the effective aperture of its antenna this http URL overcome these hardware-imposed limitations, recent neural network-based methods have leveraged high-resolution LiDAR data, paired with radar measurements, during training to enhance radar point cloud resolution. While effective, these approaches require extensive paired datasets, which are costly to acquire and prone to calibration error. These challenges motivate the need for methods that can improve radar resolution without relying on paired high-resolution ground-truth data. Here, we introduce an unsupervised radar points enhancement algorithm that employs an arbitrary LiDAR-guided diffusion model as a prior without the need for paired training data. Specifically, our approach formulates radar angle estimation recovery as an inverse problem and incorporates prior knowledge through a diffusion model with arbitrary LiDAR domain knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our method attains high fidelity and low noise performance compared to traditional regularization techniques. Additionally, compared to paired training methods, it not only achieves comparable performance but also offers improved generalization capability. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that enhances radar points output by integrating prior knowledge via a diffusion model rather than relying on paired training data.

    "summary": "Safe handover in shared autonomy for vehicle control is well-established in modern vehicles. However, avoiding accidents often requires action several seconds in advance. This necessitates understanding human driver behavior and an expert control strategy for seamless intervention when a collision or unsafe state is predicted. We propose Diffusion-SAFE, a closed-loop shared autonomy framework leveraging diffusion models to: (1) predict human driving behavior for detection of potential risks, (2) generate safe expert trajectories, and (3) enable smooth handovers by blending human and expert policies over a short time horizon. Unlike prior works which use engineered score functions to rate driving performance, our approach enables both performance evaluation and optimal action sequence generation from demonstrations. By adjusting the forward and reverse processes of the diffusion-based copilot, our method ensures a gradual transition of control authority, by mimicking the drivers' behavior before intervention, which mitigates abrupt takeovers, leading to smooth transitions. We evaluated Diffusion-SAFE in both simulation (CarRacing-v0) and real-world (ROS-based race car), measuring human-driving similarity, safety, and computational efficiency. Results demonstrate a 98.5\\% successful handover rate, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in progressively correcting human actions and continuously sampling optimal robot actions.",

These states are governed by three parameters -- tilt angle, phase shift, and slant height -- and enable discrete, programmable transformations. Using this model, we develop forward and inverse kinematic strategies to stack modules into deployable booms that approximate complex 3D shapes. We validate our approach through mechanical tests and demonstrate a tendon- and pneumatically-actuated Yoshimura Space Crane capable of object manipulation, solar tracking, and high load-bearing performance. A meter-scale solar charging station further illustrates the design's scalability. These results establish Yoshimura-Ori structures as a promising platform for adaptable, multifunctional deployable systems in both terrestrial and space environments.",

    "summary": "Achieving animal-like agility is a longstanding goal in quadrupedal robotics. While recent studies have successfully demonstrated imitation of specific behaviors, enabling robots to replicate a broader range of natural behaviors in real-world environments remains an open challenge. Here we propose an integrated controller comprising a Basic Behavior Controller (BBC) and a Task-Specific Controller (TSC) which can effectively learn diverse natural quadrupedal behaviors in an enhanced simulator and efficiently transfer them to the real world. Specifically, the BBC is trained using a novel semi-supervised generative adversarial imitation learning algorithm to extract diverse behavioral styles from raw motion capture data of real dogs, enabling smooth behavior transitions by adjusting discrete and continuous latent variable inputs. The TSC, trained via privileged learning with depth images as input, coordinates the BBC to efficiently perform various tasks. Additionally, we employ evolutionary adversarial simulator identification to optimize the simulator, aligning it closely with reality. After training, the robot exhibits diverse natural behaviors, successfully completing the quadrupedal agility challenge at an average speed of 1.1 m/s and achieving a peak speed of 3.2 m/s during hurdling. This work represents a substantial step toward animal-like agility in quadrupedal robots, opening avenues for their deployment in increasingly complex real-world environments.",

    "summary": "With the rapid development of robotics, multi-robot collaboration has become critical and challenging. One key problem is integrating data from multiple robots to build a globally consistent and accurate map for robust cooperation and precise localization. While traditional multi-robot pose graph optimization (PGO) maintains basic global consistency, it focuses primarily on pose optimization and ignores the geometric structure of the map. Moreover, PGO only uses loop closure as a constraint between two nodes, failing to fully exploit its capability to maintaining local consistency of multi-robot maps. Therefore, PGO-based multi-robot mapping methods often suffer from serious map divergence and blur, especially in regions with overlapping submaps. To address this issue, we propose Lemon-Mapping, a loop-enhanced framework for large-scale multi-session point cloud map fusion and optimization, which reasonably utilizes loop closure and improves the geometric quality of the map. We re-examine the role of loops for multi-robot mapping and introduce three key innovations. First, we develop a robust loop processing mechanism that effectively rejects outliers and a novel loop recall strategy to recover mistakenly removed loops. Second, we introduce a spatial bundle adjustment method for multi-robot maps that significantly reduces the divergence in overlapping regions and eliminates map blur. Third, we design a PGO strategy that leverages the refined constraints of bundle adjustment to extend the local accuracy to the global map. We validate our framework on several public datasets and a self-collected dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional map merging approaches in terms of mapping accuracy and reduction of map divergence. Scalability experiments also demonstrate the strong capability of our framework to handle scenarios involving numerous robots.",

    "summary": "Learning by imitation provides an effective way for robots to develop well-regulated complex behaviors and directly benefit from natural demonstrations. State-of-the-art imitation learning (IL) approaches typically leverage Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP), which, despite their impressive results, suffer from two key limitations. They are prone to mode collapse, which often leads to overfitting to the simulation environment and thus increased sim-to-real gap, and they struggle to learn diverse behaviors effectively. To overcome these limitations, we introduce APEX (Action Priors enable Efficient eXploration): a simple yet versatile imitation learning framework that integrates demonstrations directly into reinforcement learning (RL), maintaining high exploration while grounding behavior with expert-informed priors. We achieve this through a combination of decaying action priors, which initially bias exploration toward expert demonstrations but gradually allow the policy to explore independently. This is complemented by a multi-critic RL framework that effectively balances stylistic consistency with task performance. Our approach achieves sample-efficient imitation learning and enables the acquisition of diverse skills within a single policy. APEX generalizes to varying velocities and preserves reference-like styles across complex tasks such as navigating rough terrain and climbing stairs, utilizing only flat-terrain kinematic motion data as a prior. We validate our framework through extensive hardware experiments on the Unitree Go2 quadruped. There, APEX yields diverse and agile locomotion gaits, inherent gait transitions, and the highest reported speed for the platform to the best of our knowledge (peak velocity of ~3.3 m/s on hardware). Our results establish APEX as a compelling alternative to existing IL methods, offering better efficiency, adaptability, and real-world performance.",

The fruit-picking throughput achieved by the algorithm was assessed using synthetically generated fruit coordinates and a harvester design featuring up to 12 arms. The throughput increased monotonically as more arms were added. Adding more arms when fruit densities were low resulted in diminishing gains because it took longer to travel from one fruit to another. However, when there were enough fruits, the proposed algorithm achieved a linear speedup as the number of arms increased.",

The spatial clustering we propose offers to simultaneously solve the task allocation problem and deal with collision risks by cutting the workspace into distinguishable operational zones for each robot. To divide task sites and to schedule robot routes within corresponding clusters, we use K-means clustering and the 2-Opt algorithm. The presented framework shows satisfactory performance, where up to 93\\% time reduction (1.24s against 17.62s) with a solution quality improvement of up to 7\\% compared to the best performing method is demonstrated. Our method also completely eliminates collision points that persist in comparative methods in a most significant sense. Theoretical analysis agrees with the claim that spatial partitioning unifies the apparently disjoint tasks allocation and collision avoidance problems under conditions of many identical tasks to be distributed over sparse geographical areas. Ultimately, the findings in this work are of substantial importance for real world applications where both computational efficiency and operation free from collisions is of paramount importance.",

FlowDreamer first predicts 3D scene flow from past frame and action conditions with a U-Net, and then a diffusion model will predict the future frame utilizing the scene flow. FlowDreamer is trained end-to-end despite its modularized nature. We conduct experiments on 4 different benchmarks, covering both video prediction and visual planning tasks. The results demonstrate that FlowDreamer achieves better performance compared to other baseline RGB-D world models by 7% on semantic similarity, 11% on pixel quality, and 6% on success rate in various robot manipulation domains.",

To overcome these limitations, we enhance the DROID dataset with high-quality depth maps and point clouds, constructing DROID-3D as a valuable supplement for 3D embodied vision research. Then we develop EmbodiedMAE, a multi-modal masked autoencoder that simultaneously learns representations across RGB, depth, and point cloud modalities through stochastic masking and cross-modal fusion. Trained on DROID-3D, EmbodiedMAE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art vision foundation models (VFMs) in both training efficiency and final performance across 70 simulation tasks and 20 real-world robot manipulation tasks on two robot platforms. The model exhibits strong scaling behavior with size and promotes effective policy learning from 3D inputs. Experimental results establish EmbodiedMAE as a reliable unified 3D multi-modal VFM for embodied AI systems, particularly in precise tabletop manipulation settings where spatial perception is critical.",

    "summary": "Learning from demonstration (LfD) is a technique that allows expert teachers to teach task-oriented skills to robotic systems. However, the most effective way of guiding novice teachers to approach expert-level demonstrations quantitatively for specific teaching tasks remains an open question. To this end, this paper investigates the use of machine teaching (MT) to guide novice teachers to improve their teaching skills based on reinforcement learning from demonstration (RLfD). The paper reports an experiment in which novices receive MT-derived guidance to train their ability to teach a given motor skill with only 8 demonstrations and generalise this to previously unseen ones. Results indicate that the MT-guidance not only enhances robot learning performance by 89% on the training skill but also causes a 70% improvement in robot learning performance on skills not seen by subjects during training. These findings highlight the effectiveness of MT-guidance in upskilling human teaching behaviours, ultimately improving demonstration quality in RLfD.",

    "summary": "Safety is a critical requirement for the real-world deployment of robotic systems. Unfortunately, while current robot foundation models show promising generalization capabilities across a wide variety of tasks, they fail to address safety, an important aspect for ensuring long-term operation. Current robot foundation models assume that safe behavior should emerge by learning from a sufficiently large dataset of demonstrations. However, this approach has two clear major drawbacks. Firstly, there are no formal safety guarantees for a behavior cloning policy trained using supervised learning. Secondly, without explicit knowledge of any safety constraints, the policy may require an unreasonable number of additional demonstrations to even approximate the desired constrained behavior. To solve these key issues, we show how we can instead combine robot foundation models with geometric inductive biases using ATACOM, a safety layer placed after the foundation policy that ensures safe state transitions by enforcing action constraints. With this approach, we can ensure formal safety guarantees for generalist policies without providing extensive demonstrations of safe behavior, and without requiring any specific fine-tuning for safety. Our experiments show that our approach can be beneficial both for classical manipulation tasks, where we avoid unwanted collisions with irrelevant objects, and for dynamic tasks, such as the robot air hockey environment, where we can generate fast trajectories respecting complex tasks and joint space constraints.",

Our approach reduces crash rates by around $49\\%$ compared to baselines on aggressive maneuvers in simulation. On the Crazyflie hardware platform, we demonstrate feasibility through experiments that lead to successful flights.

    "summary": "In physical human-robot interaction, force feedback has been the most common sensing modality to convey the human intention to the robot. It is widely used in admittance control to allow the human to direct the robot. However, it cannot be used in scenarios where direct force feedback is not available since manipulated objects are not always equipped with a force sensor. In this work, we study one such scenario: the collaborative pushing and pulling of heavy objects on frictional surfaces, a prevalent task in industrial settings. When humans do it, they communicate through verbal and non-verbal cues, where body poses, and movements often convey more than words. We propose a novel context-aware approach using Directed Graph Neural Networks to analyze spatio-temporal human posture data to predict human motion intention for non-verbal collaborative physical manipulation. Our experiments demonstrate that robot assistance significantly reduces human effort and improves task efficiency. The results indicate that incorporating posture-based context recognition, either together with or as an alternative to force sensing, enhances robot decision-making and control efficiency.",

    "summary": "Research on autonomous robotic surgery has largely focused on simple task automation in controlled environments. However, real-world surgical applications require dexterous manipulation over extended time scales while demanding generalization across diverse variations in human tissue. These challenges remain difficult to address using existing logic-based or conventional end-to-end learning strategies. To bridge this gap, we propose a hierarchical framework for dexterous, long-horizon surgical tasks. Our method employs a high-level policy for task planning and a low-level policy for generating task-space controls for the surgical robot. The high-level planner plans tasks using language, producing task-specific or corrective instructions that guide the robot at a coarse level. Leveraging language as a planning modality offers an intuitive and generalizable interface, mirroring how experienced surgeons instruct traineers during procedures. We validate our framework in ex-vivo experiments on a complex minimally invasive procedure, cholecystectomy, and conduct ablative studies to assess key design choices. Our approach achieves a 100% success rate across n=8 different ex-vivo gallbladders, operating fully autonomously without human intervention. The hierarchical approach greatly improves the policy's ability to recover from suboptimal states that are inevitable in the highly dynamic environment of realistic surgical applications. This work represents the first demonstration of step-level autonomy, marking a critical milestone toward autonomous surgical systems for clinical studies. By advancing generalizable autonomy in surgical robotics, our approach brings the field closer to real-world deployment.",

Our approach proposes a tri-level conflict detection and resolution framework that includes the physical coupling between the robots. Moreover, pc-dbCBS alternates iteratively between state space representations, thereby preserving probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality while relying only on single-robot motion primitives. Across 25 simulated and six real-world problems involving multirotors carrying a cable-suspended payload and differential-drive robots linked by rigid rods, pc-dbCBS solves up to 92% more instances than a state-of-the-art baseline and plans trajectories that are 50-60% faster while reducing planning time by an order of magnitude.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in deep generative models demonstrate unprecedented zero-shot generalization capabilities, offering great potential for robot manipulation in unstructured environments. Given a partial observation of a scene, deep generative models could generate the unseen regions and therefore provide more context, which enhances the capability of robots to generalize across unseen environments. However, due to the visual artifacts in generated images and inefficient integration of multi-modal features in policy learning, this direction remains an open challenge. We introduce NVSPolicy, a generalizable language-conditioned policy learning method that couples an adaptive novel-view synthesis module with a hierarchical policy network. Given an input image, NVSPolicy dynamically selects an informative viewpoint and synthesizes an adaptive novel-view image to enrich the visual context. To mitigate the impact of the imperfect synthesized images, we adopt a cycle-consistent VAE mechanism that disentangles the visual features into the semantic feature and the remaining feature. The two features are then fed into the hierarchical policy network respectively: the semantic feature informs the high-level meta-skill selection, and the remaining feature guides low-level action estimation. Moreover, we propose several practical mechanisms to make the proposed method efficient. Extensive experiments on CALVIN demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method. Specifically, it achieves an average success rate of 90.4\\% across all tasks, greatly outperforming the recent methods. Ablation studies confirm the significance of our adaptive novel-view synthesis paradigm. In addition, we evaluate NVSPolicy on a real-world robotic platform to demonstrate its practical applicability.",

Existing path planning methods for auxiliary cameras track two-dimensional surgical features but do not simultaneously account for camera orientation, workspace constraints, and robot joint limits. This study presents AutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve visualization in RAMIS. Implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, the system uses a priority-based, workspace-constrained control algorithm that combines heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained 99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\\pm$ 2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study (N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new multi-camera visualization methods in RAMIS.",

    "summary": "Accurately estimating human internal states, such as personality traits or behavioral patterns, is critical for enhancing the effectiveness of human-robot interaction, particularly in group settings. These insights are key in applications ranging from social navigation to autism diagnosis. However, prior methods are limited by scalability and passive observation, making real-time estimation in complex, multi-human settings difficult. In this work, we propose a practical method for active human personality estimation in groups, with a focus on applications related to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Our method combines a personality-conditioned behavior model, based on the Eysenck 3-Factor theory, with an active robot information gathering policy that triggers human behaviors through a receding-horizon planner. The robot's belief about human personality is then updated via Bayesian inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations, user studies with typical adults, and preliminary experiments involving participants with ASD. Our results show that our method can scale to tens of humans and reduce personality prediction error by 29.2% and uncertainty by 79.9% in simulation. User studies with typical adults confirm the method's ability to generalize across complex personality distributions. Additionally, we explore its application in autism-related scenarios, demonstrating that the method can identify the difference between neurotypical and autistic behavior, highlighting its potential for diagnosing ASD. The results suggest that our framework could serve as a foundation for future ASD-specific interventions.",

    "summary": "Imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) each offer distinct advantages for robotics policy learning: IL provides stable learning from demonstrations, and RL promotes generalization through exploration. While existing robot learning approaches using IL-based pre-training followed by RL-based fine-tuning are promising, this two-step learning paradigm often suffers from instability and poor sample efficiency during the RL fine-tuning phase. In this work, we introduce IN-RIL, INterleaved Reinforcement learning and Imitation Learning, for policy fine-tuning, which periodically injects IL updates after multiple RL updates and hence can benefit from the stability of IL and the guidance of expert data for more efficient exploration throughout the entire fine-tuning process. Since IL and RL involve different optimization objectives, we develop gradient separation mechanisms to prevent destructive interference during \\ABBR fine-tuning, by separating possibly conflicting gradient updates in orthogonal subspaces. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous analysis, and our findings shed light on why interleaving IL with RL stabilizes learning and improves sample-efficiency. Extensive experiments on 14 robot manipulation and locomotion tasks across 3 benchmarks, including FurnitureBench, OpenAI Gym, and Robomimic, demonstrate that \\ABBR can significantly improve sample efficiency and mitigate performance collapse during online finetuning in both long- and short-horizon tasks with either sparse or dense rewards. IN-RIL, as a general plug-in compatible with various state-of-the-art RL algorithms, can significantly improve RL fine-tuning, e.g., from 12\\% to 88\\% with 6.3x improvement in the success rate on Robomimic Transport.

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable potential in robotic manipulation but faces challenges in sample inefficiency and lack of interpretability, limiting its applicability in real world scenarios. Enabling the agent to gain a deeper understanding and adapt more efficiently to diverse working scenarios is crucial, and strategic knowledge utilization is a key factor in this process. This paper proposes a Knowledge Capture, Adaptation, and Composition (KCAC) framework to systematically integrate knowledge transfer into RL through cross-task curriculum learning. KCAC is evaluated using a two block stacking task in the CausalWorld benchmark, a complex robotic manipulation environment. To our knowledge, existing RL approaches fail to solve this task effectively, reflecting deficiencies in knowledge capture. In this work, we redesign the benchmark reward function by removing rigid constraints and strict ordering, allowing the agent to maximize total rewards concurrently and enabling flexible task completion. Furthermore, we define two self-designed sub-tasks and implement a structured cross-task curriculum to facilitate efficient learning. As a result, our KCAC approach achieves a 40 percent reduction in training time while improving task success rates by 10 percent compared to traditional RL methods. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key curriculum design parameters subtask selection, transition timing, and learning rate that optimize learning efficiency and provide conceptual guidance for curriculum based RL frameworks. This work offers valuable insights into curriculum design in RL and robotic learning.",

Satisficing planners have traditionally found feasible solutions quickly but provide no guarantees on their optimality, while almost-surely asymptotically optimal (a.s.a.o.) planners have probabilistic guarantees on their convergence towards an optimal solution but are more computationally expensive.\nThis paper uses the AO-x meta-algorithm to extend the satisficing RRT-Connect planner to optimal planning. The resulting Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect (AORRTC) finds initial solutions in similar times as RRT-Connect and uses any additional planning time to converge towards the optimal solution in an anytime manner. It is proven to be probabilistically complete and a.s.a.o.\nAORRTC was tested with the Panda (7 DoF) and Fetch (8 DoF) robotic arms on the MotionBenchMaker dataset. These experiments show that AORRTC finds initial solutions as fast as RRT-Connect and faster than the tested state-of-the-art a.s.a.o. algorithms while converging to better solutions faster. AORRTC finds solutions to difficult high-DoF planning problems in milliseconds where the other a.s.a.o. planners could not consistently find solutions in seconds.

    "summary": "Foundation models can provide robust high-level reasoning on appropriate safety interventions in hazardous scenarios beyond a robot's training data, i.e. out-of-distribution (OOD) failures. However, due to the high inference latency of Large Vision and Language Models, current methods rely on manually defined intervention policies to enact fallbacks, thereby lacking the ability to plan generalizable, semantically safe motions. To overcome these challenges we present FORTRESS, a framework that generates and reasons about semantically safe fallback strategies in real time to prevent OOD failures. At a low frequency in nominal operations, FORTRESS uses multi-modal reasoners to identify goals and anticipate failure modes. When a runtime monitor triggers a fallback response, FORTRESS rapidly synthesizes plans to fallback goals while inferring and avoiding semantically unsafe regions in real time. By bridging open-world, multi-modal reasoning with dynamics-aware planning, we eliminate the need for hard-coded fallbacks and human safety interventions. FORTRESS outperforms on-the-fly prompting of slow reasoning models in safety classification accuracy on synthetic benchmarks and real-world ANYmal robot data, and further improves system safety and planning success in simulation and on quadrotor hardware for urban navigation.",

    "summary": "Grasping mechanisms must both create and subsequently hold grasps that permit safe and effective object manipulation. Existing mechanisms address the different functional requirements of grasp creation and grasp holding using a single morphology, but have yet to achieve the simultaneous strength, gentleness, and versatility needed for many applications. We present \"loop closure grasping\", a class of robotic grasping that addresses these different functional requirements through topological transformations between open-loop and closed-loop morphologies. We formalize these morphologies for grasping, formulate the loop closure grasping method, and present principles and a design architecture that we implement using soft growing inflated beams, winches, and clamps. The mechanisms' initial open-loop topology enables versatile grasp creation via unencumbered tip movement, and closing the loop enables strong and gentle holding with effectively infinite bending compliance. Loop closure grasping circumvents the tradeoffs of single-morphology designs, enabling grasps involving historically challenging objects, environments, and configurations.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a risk-aware safe reinforcement learning (RL) control design for stochastic discrete-time linear systems. Rather than using a safety certifier to myopically intervene with the RL controller, a risk-informed safe controller is also learned besides the RL controller, and the RL and safe controllers are combined together. Several advantages come along with this approach: 1) High-confidence safety can be certified without relying on a high-fidelity system model and using limited data available, 2) Myopic interventions and convergence to an undesired equilibrium can be avoided by deciding on the contribution of two stabilizing controllers, and 3) highly efficient and computationally tractable solutions can be provided by optimizing over a scalar decision variable and linear programming polyhedral sets. To learn safe controllers with a large invariant set, piecewise affine controllers are learned instead of linear controllers. To this end, the closed-loop system is first represented using collected data, a decision variable, and noise. The effect of the decision variable on the variance of the safe violation of the closed-loop system is formalized. The decision variable is then designed such that the probability of safety violation for the learned closed-loop system is minimized. It is shown that this control-oriented approach reduces the data requirements and can also reduce the variance of safety violations. Finally, to integrate the safe and RL controllers, a new data-driven interpolation technique is introduced. This method aims to maintain the RL agent's optimal implementation while ensuring its safety within environments characterized by noise. The study concludes with a simulation example that serves to validate the theoretical results.",

This task, known as Goal Recognition (GR), poses significant challenges in dynamic environments where goals are numerous and constantly evolving.

To address this limitation, we introduce the General Dynamic GR problem - a broader definition of GR - aimed at enabling real-time GR systems and fostering further research in this area. Expanding on this foundation, this paper employs a model-free goal-conditioned RL approach to enable fast adaptation for GR across various changing tasks.",

    "summary": "The recently developed Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown encouraging and impressive results for visual SLAM. However, most representative methods require RGBD sensors and are only available for indoor environments. The robustness of reconstruction in large-scale outdoor scenarios remains unexplored. This paper introduces a large-scale 3DGS-based visual SLAM with stereo cameras, termed LSG-SLAM. The proposed LSG-SLAM employs a multi-modality strategy to estimate prior poses under large view changes. In tracking, we introduce feature-alignment warping constraints to alleviate the adverse effects of appearance similarity in rendering losses. For the scalability of large-scale scenarios, we introduce continuous Gaussian Splatting submaps to tackle unbounded scenes with limited memory. Loops are detected between GS submaps by place recognition and the relative pose between looped keyframes is optimized utilizing rendering and feature warping losses. After the global optimization of camera poses and Gaussian points, a structure refinement module enhances the reconstruction quality. With extensive evaluations on the EuRoc and KITTI datasets, LSG-SLAM achieves superior performance over existing Neural, 3DGS-based, and even traditional approaches. Project page: this https URL.",

Existing car-following models often lack rigorous safety proofs and the ability to replicate human-like driving behaviors consistently. This article applies multi-phase dynamical systems analysis to well-known car-following models to highlight the characteristics and limitations of existing approaches. We begin by formulating fundamental principles for safe and human-like car-following behaviors, which include zeroth-order principles for comfort and minimum jam spacings, first-order principles for speeds and time gaps, and second-order principles for comfort acceleration/deceleration bounds as well as braking profiles. From a set of these zeroth- and first-order principles, we derive Newell's simplified car-following model. Subsequently, we analyze phases within the speed-spacing plane for the stationary lead-vehicle problem in Newell's model and its extensions, which incorporate both bounded acceleration and deceleration. We then analyze the performance of the Intelligent Driver Model and the Gipps model. Through this analysis, we highlight the limitations of these models with respect to some of the aforementioned principles. Numerical simulations and empirical observations validate the theoretical insights. Finally, we discuss future research directions to further integrate safety, human-like behaviors, and vehicular automation in car-following models, which are addressed in Part 2 of this study \\citep{jin2025WA20-02_Part2}, where we develop a novel multi-phase projection-based car-following model that addresses the limitations identified here.",

While existing car-following models often struggle to consistently provide rigorous safety proofs alongside human-like acceleration and deceleration patterns, we introduce a novel multi-phase projection-based car-following model. This model is designed to balance safety and performance by incorporating bounded acceleration and deceleration rates while emulating key human driving principles. Building upon a foundation of fundamental driving principles and a multi-phase dynamical systems analysis (detailed in Part 1 of this study \\citep{jin2025WA20-02_Part1}), we first highlight the limitations of extending standard models like Newell's with simple bounded deceleration. Inspired by human drivers' anticipatory behavior, we mathematically define and analyze projected braking profiles for both leader and follower vehicles, establishing safety criteria and new phase definitions based on the projected braking lead-vehicle problem. The proposed parsimonious model combines an extended Newell's model for nominal driving with a new control law for scenarios requiring projected braking. Using speed-spacing phase plane analysis, we provide rigorous mathematical proofs of the model's adherence to defined safe and human-like driving principles, including collision-free operation, bounded deceleration, and acceptable safe stopping distance, under reasonable initial conditions. Numerical simulations validate the model's superior performance in achieving both safety and human-like braking profiles for the stationary lead-vehicle problem.

In this paper, we define the ``leaking corner issue\" in terms of value functions, propose and prove a necessary condition for its occurrence. We then use these theoretical contributions to introduce a new local updating method that efficiently corrects inaccurate value functions while maintaining the computational efficiency of the dimensionality reduction approaches.

To avoid extensive efforts from manual labeling, methods for automating the map creation have emerged. Recent trends have moved from offline mapping to online mapping, ensuring availability and actuality of the utilized maps. While the performance has increased in recent years, online mapping still faces challenges regarding temporal consistency, sensor occlusion, runtime, and generalization. We propose a novel offline mapping approach that integrates trails - informal routes used by drivers - into the map creation process. Our method aggregates trail data from the ego vehicle and other traffic participants to construct a comprehensive global map using transformer-based deep learning models. Unlike traditional offline mapping, our approach enables continuous updates while remaining sensor-agnostic, facilitating efficient data transfer. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art online mapping approaches, achieving improved generalization to previously unseen environments and sensor configurations.

    "summary": "This research focuses on how Large Language Models (LLMs) can help with (path) planning for mobile embodied agents such as robots, in a human-in-the-loop and interactive manner. A novel framework named LLM A*, aims to leverage the commonsense of LLMs, and the utility-optimal A* is proposed to facilitate few-shot near-optimal path planning. Prompts are used for two main purposes: 1) to provide LLMs with essential information like environments, costs, heuristics, etc.; 2) to communicate human feedback on intermediate planning results to LLMs. This approach takes human feedback on board and renders the entire planning process transparent (akin to a `white box') to humans. Moreover, it facilitates code-free path planning, thereby fostering the accessibility and inclusiveness of artificial intelligence techniques to communities less proficient in coding. Comparative analysis against A* and RL demonstrates that LLM A* exhibits greater efficiency in terms of search space and achieves paths comparable to A* while outperforming RL. The interactive nature of LLM A* also makes it a promising tool for deployment in collaborative human-robot tasks. Codes and Supplemental Materials can be found at GitHub: this https URL.",

In this work, we propose a method to learn from internet-scale videos that do not have robot action labels. We first train an action quantization model leveraging VQ-VAE-based objective to learn discrete latent actions between image frames, then pretrain a latent VLA model to predict these latent actions from observations and task descriptions, and finally finetune the VLA on small-scale robot manipulation data to map from latent to robot actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing techniques that train robot manipulation policies from large-scale videos. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model trained with robotic action labels on real-world manipulation tasks that require language conditioning, generalization to unseen objects, and semantic generalization to unseen instructions.

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has the potential to enable robots to learn from their own actions in the real world. Unfortunately, RL can be prohibitively expensive, in terms of on-robot runtime, due to inefficient exploration when learning from a sparse reward signal. Designing dense reward functions is labour-intensive and requires domain expertise. In our work, we propose GCR (Goal-Contrastive Rewards), a dense reward function learning method that can be trained on passive video demonstrations. By using videos without actions, our method is easier to scale, as we can use arbitrary videos. GCR combines two loss functions, an implicit value loss function that models how the reward increases when traversing a successful trajectory, and a goal-contrastive loss that discriminates between successful and failed trajectories. We perform experiments in simulated manipulation environments across RoboMimic and MimicGen tasks, as well as in the real world using a Franka arm and a Spot quadruped. We find that GCR leads to a more-sample efficient RL, enabling model-free RL to solve about twice as many tasks as our baseline reward learning methods. We also demonstrate positive cross-embodiment transfer from videos of people and of other robots performing a task. Website: this https URL.",

Among the proposed approaches, airflow stands out for its ability to project across considerable distances and its flexibility in actuating objects of varying materials, sizes, and shapes. However, predicting airflow fields at a distance-and the motion of objects within them-remains notoriously challenging due to their nonlinear and stochastic nature. Here, we propose a model-based learning approach using a jet-induced airflow field for remote multi-object manipulation on a surface. Our approach incorporates an analytical model of the field, learned object dynamics, and a model-based controller. The model predicts an air velocity field over an infinite surface for a specified jet orientation, while the object dynamics are learned through a robust system identification algorithm. Using the model-based controller, we can automatically and remotely, at meter-scale distances, control the motion of single and multiple objects for different tasks, such as path-following, aggregating, and sorting.",

We present a novel distributed volumetric mapping framework designated as CRADMap that addresses these issues by extending the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ORBSLAM3 system with the COVINS on the backend for global optimization. Our pipeline for volumetric reconstruction fuses dense keyframes at a centralized server via 5G connectivity, aggregating geometry, and occupancy information from multiple autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) without overtaxing onboard resources. This enables each AMR to independently perform mapping while the backend constructs high-fidelity real-time 3D maps. To operate Beyond the Visible (BtV) and overcome the limitations of standard visual sensors, we automated a standalone 4D mmWave radar module that functions independently without sensor fusion with SLAM. The BtV system enables the detection and mapping of occluded metallic objects in cluttered environments, enhancing situational awareness in inspection scenarios. Experimental validation in Section~\\ref{sec:IV} demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework.",

    "summary": "World models aim to learn or construct representations of the environment that enable the prediction of future scenes, thereby supporting intelligent motion planning. However, existing models often struggle to produce fine-grained predictions and to operate in real time. In this work, we propose T$^3$Former, a novel 4D occupancy world model for autonomous driving. T$^3$Former begins by pre-training a compact {\\em triplane} representation that efficiently encodes 3D occupancy. It then extracts multi-scale temporal motion features from historical triplanes and employs an autoregressive approach to iteratively predict future triplane changes. Finally, these triplane changes are combined with previous states to decode future occupancy and ego-motion trajectories. Experimental results show that T$^3$Former achieves 1.44$\\times$ speedup (26 FPS), improves mean IoU to 36.09, and reduces mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters.

While advancements in large language models (LLMs) and embodied intelligence make this goal closer, several challenges persist: the lack of a unified benchmark for more complex robot tasks, limited evaluation methods and metrics, data incompatibility between LLMs and mobile manipulation trajectories. To address these issues, we propose Embodied Mobile Manipulation in Open Environments (EMMOE), a benchmark that requires agents to interpret user instructions and execute long-horizon everyday tasks in continuous space. EMMOE seamlessly integrates high-level and low-level embodied tasks into a unified framework, along with three new metrics for more diverse assessment. Additionally, we collect~\\dataset, which features in various task attributes, detailed process annotations, re-plans after failures, and two sub-datasets for LLM training. Furthermore, we design~\\model, a sophisticated agent system consists of LLM with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), light weighted navigation and manipulation models, and multiple error detection mechanisms.

Traditional wrists struggle to balance these demands, often relying on complex control schemes or complicated mechanical designs to mitigate potential damage from force overload. In response, we present BiFlex, a flexible robotic wrist that uses a soft buckling honeycomb structure to provides a natural bimodal stiffness response. The higher stiffness mode enables precise household object manipulation, while the lower stiffness mode provides the compliance needed to adapt to external forces. We design BiFlex to maintain a fingertip deflection of less than 1 cm while supporting loads up to 500g and create a BiFlex wrist for many grippers, including Panda, Robotiq, and BaRiFlex. We validate BiFlex under several real-world experimental evaluations, including surface wiping, precise pick-and-place, and grasping under environmental constraints. We demonstrate that BiFlex simplifies control while maintaining precise object manipulation and enhanced safety in real-world applications.",

However, most existing approaches heavily rely on scaling action-annotated data to enhance their capabilities. Consequently, they are often limited to single physical specification and struggle to learn transferable knowledge across different embodiments and environments. To confront these limitations, we propose UniVLA, a new framework for learning cross-embodiment vision-language-action (VLA) policies. Our key innovation is to derive task-centric action representations from videos with a latent action model. This enables us to exploit extensive data across a wide spectrum of embodiments and perspectives. To mitigate the effect of task-irrelevant dynamics, we incorporate language instructions and establish a latent action model within the DINO feature space. Learned from internet-scale videos, the generalist policy can be deployed to various robots through efficient latent action decoding. We obtain state-of-the-art results across multiple manipulation and navigation benchmarks, as well as real-robot deployments. UniVLA achieves superior performance over OpenVLA with less than 1/20 of pretraining compute and 1/10 of downstream data. Continuous performance improvements are observed as heterogeneous data, even including human videos, are incorporated into the training pipeline. The results underscore UniVLA's potential to facilitate scalable and efficient robot policy learning.",

    "summary": "Human videos offer a scalable way to train robot manipulation policies, but lack the action labels needed by standard imitation learning algorithms. Existing cross-embodiment approaches try to map human motion to robot actions, but often fail when the embodiments differ significantly. We propose X-Sim, a real-to-sim-to-real framework that uses object motion as a dense and transferable signal for learning robot policies. X-Sim starts by reconstructing a photorealistic simulation from an RGBD human video and tracking object trajectories to define object-centric rewards. These rewards are used to train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy in simulation. The learned policy is then distilled into an image-conditioned diffusion policy using synthetic rollouts rendered with varied viewpoints and lighting. To transfer to the real world, X-Sim introduces an online domain adaptation technique that aligns real and simulated observations during deployment. Importantly, X-Sim does not require any robot teleoperation data. We evaluate it across 5 manipulation tasks in 2 environments and show that it: (1) improves task progress by 30% on average over hand-tracking and sim-to-real baselines, (2) matches behavior cloning with 10x less data collection time, and (3) generalizes to new camera viewpoints and test-time changes.

However, applying this ability to robots presents significant challenges due to the inherent differences between human and robot embodiments in both their visual appearance and physical capabilities. While previous methods bridge this gap using cross-embodiment datasets with shared scenes and tasks, collecting such aligned data between humans and robots at scale is not trivial. In this paper, we propose UniSkill, a novel framework that learns embodiment-agnostic skill representations from large-scale cross-embodiment video data without any labels, enabling skills extracted from human video prompts to effectively transfer to robot policies trained only on robot data. Our experiments in both simulation and real-world environments show that our cross-embodiment skills successfully guide robots in selecting appropriate actions, even with unseen video prompts.

    "summary": "In recent years, embodied intelligent robotics (EIR) has made significant progress in multi-modal perception, autonomous decision-making, and physical interaction. Some robots have already been tested in general-purpose scenarios such as homes and shopping malls. We aim to advance the research and application of embodied intelligence in industrial scenes. However, current EIR lacks a deep understanding of industrial environment semantics and the normative constraints between industrial operating objects. To address this gap, this paper first reviews the history of industrial robotics and the mainstream EIR frameworks. We then introduce the concept of the embodied intelligent industrial robotics (EIIR) and propose a knowledge-driven EIIR technology framework for industrial environments. The framework includes four main modules: world model, high-level task planner, low-level skill controller, and simulator. We also review the current development of technologies related to each module and highlight recent progress in adapting them to industrial applications. Finally, we summarize the key challenges EIIR faces in industrial scenarios and suggest future research directions. We believe that EIIR technology will shape the next generation of industrial robotics. Industrial systems based on embodied intelligent industrial robots offer strong potential for enabling intelligent manufacturing. We will continue to track and summarize new research in this area and hope this review will serve as a valuable reference for scholars and engineers interested in industrial embodied intelligence. Together, we can help drive the rapid advancement and application of this technology. The associated project can be found at this https URL.",

Here, each agent relies on data from its local sensor to perceive and respond to nearby obstacles. A point cloud processing technique is presented for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional point clouds to minimize the computational burden during the optimization. The process consists of directional filtering and down-sampling that significantly reduce the number of data points.

Their performance, in this regard, greatly exceeds that of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) of similar scale. Attempts to attain post-stall manoeuvrability, or supermanoeuvrability, in UAVs have typically focused on thrust-vectoring technology. Here we show that biomimetic wing morphing offers an additional pathway to classical supermanoeuvrability, as well as novel forms of bioinspired post-stall manoeuvrability. Using a state-of-the-art flight simulator, equipped with a multibody model of lifting surface motion and a delay differential equation (Goman-Khrabrov) dynamic stall model for all lifting surfaces, we demonstrate the capability of a biomimetic morphing-wing UAV for two post-stall manoeuvres: a classical rapid nose-pointing-and-shooting (RaNPAS) manoeuvre; and a wall landing manoeuvre inspired by biological ballistic transitions. We develop a guidance method for these manoeuvres, based on parametric variation of nonlinear longitudinal stability profiles, which allows efficient exploration of the space of post-stall manoeuvres in these types of UAVs; and yields insight into effective morphing kinematics to enable these manoeuvres. Our results demonstrate the capability of biomimetic morphing, and morphing control of nonlinear longitudinal stability, to enable advanced forms of transient supermanoeuvrability in UAVs.",

In contrast, locomotion in artificial systems often depends on centralized processors. We introduce a rapid and autonomous locomotion strategy with synchronized gaits emerging through physical interactions between self-oscillating limbs and the environment, without control signals. Each limb is a single soft tube that only requires constant flow of air to perform cyclic stepping motions at frequencies reaching 300 hertz. By combining several of these self-oscillating limbs, their physical synchronization enables locomotion speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than comparable state-of-the-art. Through body-environment dynamics, these seemingly simple devices exhibit autonomy, including obstacle avoidance, amphibious gait transitions, and phototaxis.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show growing promise in autonomous driving by reasoning over complex traffic scenarios to generate path plans. However, their tendencies toward overconfidence, and hallucinations raise critical safety concerns. We introduce SafePath, a modular framework that augments LLM-based path planning with formal safety guarantees using conformal prediction. SafePath operates in three stages. In the first stage, we use an LLM that generates a set of diverse candidate paths, exploring possible trajectories based on agent behaviors and environmental cues. In the second stage, SafePath filters out high-risk trajectories while guaranteeing that at least one safe option is included with a user-defined probability, through a multiple-choice question-answering formulation that integrates conformal prediction. In the final stage, our approach selects the path with the lowest expected collision risk when uncertainty is low or delegates control to a human when uncertainty is high. We theoretically prove that SafePath guarantees a safe trajectory with a user-defined probability, and we show how its human delegation rate can be tuned to balance autonomy and safety. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Highway-env show that SafePath reduces planning uncertainty by 77\\% and collision rates by up to 70\\%, demonstrating effectiveness in making LLM-driven path planning more safer.",

    "summary": "We present an efficient algorithm for computing the leading monomials of a minimal Groebner basis of a generic sequence of homogeneous polynomials. Our approach bypasses costly polynomial reductions by exploiting structural properties conjectured to hold for generic sequences-specifically, that their leading monomial ideals are weakly reverse lexicographic and that their Hilbert series follow a known closed-form expression. The algorithm incrementally constructs the set of leading monomials degree by degree by comparing Hilbert functions of monomial ideals with the expected Hilbert series of the input ideal. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce several optimization techniques that progressively narrow the search space and reduce the number of divisibility checks required at each step. We also refine the loop termination condition using degree bounds, thereby avoiding unnecessary recomputation of Hilbert series. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method substantially reduces both computation time and memory usage compared to conventional Groebner basis computations, particularly for large-scale systems. These results indicate that our algorithm can serve as an effective pre-processing tool for accelerating Groebner basis computations in generic polynomial sequence solving.",

Majorization has been shown to characterize inequalities among commonly used symmetric functions, except for complete homogeneous symmetric functions (shortened as CHs). In 2011, Cuttler, Greene, and Skandera posed a natural question: Can majorization also characterize inequalities among CHs? Their work demonstrated that majorization characterizes inequalities among CHs up to degree 7 and suggested exploring its validity for higher degrees. In this paper, we show that, for every degree greater than 7, majorization does not characterize inequalities among CHs.",

    "summary": "Modal synthesis methods are a long-standing approach for modelling distributed musical systems. In some cases extensions are possible in order to handle geometric nonlinearities. One such case is the high-amplitude vibration of a string, where geometric nonlinear effects lead to perceptually important effects including pitch glides and a dependence of brightness on striking amplitude. A modal decomposition leads to a coupled nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations. Recent work in applied machine learning approaches (in particular neural ordinary differential equations) has been used to model lumped dynamic systems such as electronic circuits automatically from data. In this work, we examine how modal decomposition can be combined with neural ordinary differential equations for modelling distributed musical systems. The proposed model leverages the analytical solution for linear vibration of system's modes and employs a neural network to account for nonlinear dynamic behaviour. Physical parameters of a system remain easily accessible after the training without the need for a parameter encoder in the network architecture. As an initial proof of concept, we generate synthetic data for a nonlinear transverse string and show that the model can be trained to reproduce the nonlinear dynamics of the system. Sound examples are presented.",

    "summary": "Text-to-audio (T2A) generation has achieved remarkable progress in generating a variety of audio outputs from language prompts. However, current state-of-the-art T2A models still struggle to satisfy human preferences for prompt-following and acoustic quality when generating complex multi-event audio. To improve the performance of the model in these high-level applications, we propose to enhance the basic capabilities of the model with AI feedback learning. First, we introduce fine-grained AI audio scoring pipelines to: 1) verify whether each event in the text prompt is present in the audio (Event Occurrence Score), 2) detect deviations in event sequences from the language description (Event Sequence Score), and 3) assess the overall acoustic and harmonic quality of the generated audio (Acoustic&Harmonic Quality). We evaluate these three automatic scoring pipelines and find that they correlate significantly better with human preferences than other evaluation metrics. This highlights their value as both feedback signals and evaluation metrics. Utilizing our robust scoring pipelines, we construct a large audio preference dataset, T2A-FeedBack, which contains 41k prompts and 249k audios, each accompanied by detailed scores. Moreover, we introduce T2A-EpicBench, a benchmark that focuses on long captions, multi-events, and story-telling scenarios, aiming to evaluate the advanced capabilities of T2A models. Finally, we demonstrate how T2A-FeedBack can enhance current state-of-the-art audio model. With simple preference tuning, the audio generation model exhibits significant improvements in both simple (AudioCaps test set) and complex (T2A-EpicBench) scenarios.",

    "summary": "Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to identify the direction of the attended speaker in multi-speaker environments from brain signals, such as Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. However, existing EEG-based AAD methods overlook the spatio-temporal dependencies of EEG signals, limiting their decoding and generalization abilities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Nested Network (ListenNet) for AAD. The ListenNet has three key components: Spatio-temporal Dependency Encoder (STDE), Multi-scale Temporal Enhancement (MSTE), and Cross-Nested Attention (CNA). The STDE reconstructs dependencies between consecutive time windows across channels, improving the robustness of dynamic pattern extraction. The MSTE captures temporal features at multiple scales to represent both fine-grained and long-range temporal patterns. In addition, the CNA integrates hierarchical features more effectively through novel dynamic attention mechanisms to capture deep spatio-temporal correlations. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of ListenNet over state-of-the-art methods in both subject-dependent and challenging subject-independent settings, while reducing the trainable parameter count by approximately 7 times.

    "summary": "Labelled data are limited and self-supervised learning is one of the most important approaches for reducing labelling requirements. While it has been extensively explored in the image domain, it has so far not received the same amount of attention in the acoustic domain. Yet, reducing labelling is a key requirement for many acoustic applications. Specifically in bioacoustic, there are rarely sufficient labels for fully supervised learning available. This has led to the widespread use of acoustic recognisers that have been pre-trained on unrelated data for bioacoustic tasks. We posit that training on the actual task data and combining self-supervised pre-training with few-shot classification is a superior approach that has the ability to deliver high accuracy even when only a few labels are available. To this end, we introduce and evaluate a new architecture that combines CNN-based preprocessing with feature extraction based on state space models (SSMs). This combination is motivated by the fact that CNN-based networks alone struggle to capture temporal information effectively, which is crucial for classifying acoustic signals. SSMs, specifically S4 and Mamba, on the other hand, have been shown to have an excellent ability to capture long-range dependencies in sequence data. We pre-train this architecture using contrastive learning on the actual task data and subsequent fine-tuning with an extremely small amount of labelled data. We evaluate the performance of this proposed architecture for ($n$-shot, $n$-class) classification on standard benchmarks as well as real-world data. Our evaluation shows that it outperforms state-of-the-art architectures on the few-shot classification problem.",

    "summary": "Despite deep learning's remarkable advances in style transfer across various domains, generating controllable performance-level musical style transfer for complete symbolically represented musical works remains a challenging area of research. Much of this is owed to limited datasets, especially for genres such as jazz, and the lack of unified models that can handle multiple music generation tasks. This paper presents ImprovNet, a transformer-based architecture that generates expressive and controllable musical improvisations through a self-supervised corruption-refinement training strategy. The improvisational style transfer is aimed at making meaningful modifications to one or more musical elements - melody, harmony or rhythm of the original composition with respect to the target genre. ImprovNet unifies multiple capabilities within a single model: it can perform cross-genre and intra-genre improvisations, harmonize melodies with genre-specific styles, and execute short prompt continuation and infilling tasks. The model's iterative generation framework allows users to control the degree of style transfer and structural similarity to the original composition. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate ImprovNet's effectiveness in generating musically coherent improvisations while maintaining structural relationships with the original pieces. The model outperforms Anticipatory Music Transformer in short continuation and infilling tasks and successfully achieves recognizable genre conversion, with 79\\% of participants correctly identifying jazz-style improvisations of classical pieces.

    "summary": "The inherent synchronization between a speaker's lip movements, voice, and the underlying linguistic content offers a rich source of information for improving speech processing tasks, especially in challenging conditions where traditional audio-only systems falter. We introduce CoGenAV, a powerful and data-efficient model designed to learn versatile audio-visual representations applicable across a wide range of speech and audio-visual tasks. CoGenAV is trained by optimizing a dual objective derived from natural audio-visual synchrony, contrastive feature alignment and generative text prediction, using only 223 hours of labeled data from the LRS2 dataset. This contrastive-generative synchronization strategy effectively captures fundamental cross-modal correlations. We showcase the effectiveness and versatility of the learned CoGenAV representations on multiple benchmarks. When utilized for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) on LRS2, these representations contribute to achieving a state-of-the-art Word Error Rate (WER) of 1.27. They also enable strong performance in Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) with a WER of 20.5 on LRS2, and significantly improve performance in noisy environments by over 70%. Furthermore, CoGenAV representations benefit speech reconstruction tasks, boosting performance in Speech Enhancement and Separation, and achieve competitive results in audio-visual synchronization tasks like Active Speaker Detection (ASD). Our model will be open-sourced to facilitate further development and collaboration within both academia and industry.",

In this Letter, the disturbance sensing level is examined with perceptual listening tests that demonstrate the impact of their append High Internal Noise (HIN) profile on intelligibility. This particular sensing level is then proposed as additional aid to ASD diagnosis. In this Letter, a novel intelligibility enhancement scheme is also introduced for ASD particular circumstances. For this proposal, harmonic features estimated from speech signal frames are considered as center frequencies of auditory filterbanks. A gain factor is further applied to the output of the filtered samples. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposal improved the acoustic intelligibility of ASD and Neurotypicals (NT) people considering four acoustic noises at different signal-to-noise ratios.",

    "summary": "Recent work on distilling Whisper's knowledge into small models using pseudo-labels shows promising performance while reducing the size by up to 50%. This results in small, efficient, and dedicated models. However, a critical step of distillation using pseudo-labels involves filtering high-quality predictions and using only those during training. This step requires ground truth labels to compare with and filter low-quality examples, making the process dependent on human labels. Additionally, the distillation process requires a large amount of data thereby limiting its applicability in low-resource settings. To address this, we propose a distillation framework that does not require any labeled data. Through experimentation, we show that our best-distilled models outperform the teacher model by 5-7 WER points and are on par with or outperform similar supervised data filtering setups. When scaling the data, our models significantly outperform all zero-shot and supervised models. Our models are also 25-50% more compute- and memory-efficient while maintaining performance equal to or better than that of the teacher model.

This technology improves patient care by enabling efficient communication across language barriers, alleviating specialized workforce shortages, and facilitating improved diagnosis and treatment, particularly during pandemics. In this work, we introduce MultiMed, the first multilingual medical ASR dataset, along with the first collection of small-to-large end-to-end medical ASR models, spanning five languages: Vietnamese, English, German, French, and Mandarin Chinese. To our best knowledge, MultiMed stands as the world's largest medical ASR dataset across all major benchmarks: total duration, number of recording conditions, number of accents, and number of speaking roles. Furthermore, we present the first multilinguality study for medical ASR, which includes reproducible empirical baselines, a monolinguality-multilinguality analysis, Attention Encoder Decoder (AED) vs Hybrid comparative study and a linguistic analysis. We present practical ASR end-to-end training schemes optimized for a fixed number of trainable parameters that are common in industry settings.

    "summary": "With the rise of decentralized computing, as in the Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and personalized healthcare, it is increasingly important to process time-dependent signals at the edge efficiently: right at the place where the temporal data are collected, avoiding time-consuming, insecure, and costly communication with a centralized computing facility (or cloud). However, modern-day processors often cannot meet the restrained power and time budgets of edge systems because of intrinsic limitations imposed by their architecture (von Neumann bottleneck) or domain conversions (analogue-to-digital and time-to-frequency). Here, we propose an edge temporal-signal processor based on two in-materia computing systems for both feature extraction and classification, reaching a software-level accuracy of 96.2% for the TI-46-Word speech-recognition task. First, a nonlinear, room-temperature dopant-network-processing-unit (DNPU) layer realizes analogue, time-domain feature extraction from the raw audio signals, similar to the human cochlea. Second, an analogue in-memory computing (AIMC) chip, consisting of memristive crossbar arrays, implements a compact neural network trained on the extracted features for classification. With the DNPU feature extraction consuming 100s nW and AIMC-based classification having the potential for less than 10 fJ per multiply-accumulate operation, our findings offer a promising avenue for advancing the compactness, efficiency, and performance of heterogeneous smart edge processors through in-materia computing hardware.",

This approach is particularly valuable for scientific computing applications in which comprehensive tests are needed to prevent flawed results or conclusions. As scientific discovery becomes increasingly more complex, domain scientists couple multiple scientific computing models or simulations to solve intricate multiphysics and multiscale problems. These model-coupling applications use a hardwired coupling program or a flexible web service to link and combine different models. In this paper, we focus on the quality assurance of the more elastic web service via a combination of rigorous specification and testing methods. The application of statistical testing exposes problems ignored by pre-written unit tests and highlights areas in the code where failures might occur. We certify the model-coupling server controller with a derived reliability statistic, offering a quantitative measure to support a claim of its robustness.",

    "summary": "As society becomes increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence, the need to mitigate risk and harm is paramount. In response, researchers and practitioners have developed tools to detect and reduce undesired bias, commonly referred to as fairness tools. Many of these tools are publicly available for free use and adaptation. While the growing availability of such tools is promising, little is known about the broader landscape beyond well-known examples like AI Fairness 360 and Fairlearn. Because fairness is an ongoing concern, these tools must be built for long-term sustainability. Using an existing set of fairness tools as a reference, we systematically searched GitHub and identified 50 related projects. We then analyzed various aspects of their repositories to assess community engagement and the extent of ongoing maintenance. Our findings show diverse forms of engagement with these tools, suggesting strong support for open-source development. However, we also found significant variation in how well these tools are maintained. Notably, 53 percent of fairness projects become inactive within the first three years. By examining sustainability in fairness tooling, we aim to promote more stability and growth in this critical area.",

The strengths and weaknesses of LLMs versus trained programmers were compared through quantitative metrics and manual qualitative analysis. The results show that the effectiveness of LLMs depends on well-designed prompts, robust implementation, and precise requirements.

It complements previous theoretical work published by existing developers of Automated Driving Systems (ADS) on the overall engineering practices and methodologies for readiness determination. Readiness determination is, at its core, a risk assessment process. It is aimed at evaluating the residual risk associated with the deployment of a new software release candidate. The paper proposes methodological criteria to ground the readiness review process for an ADS release. While informed by Waymo's experience in this domain, the criteria presented are agnostic of any specific ADS technological solution and/or architectural choice, to support broad implementation by others in the industry. The paper continues with a discussion on governance and decision-making toward approval of a new software release candidate for the ADS. The implementation of the presented criteria requires the existence of appropriate safety management practices in addition to many other cultural, procedural, and operational considerations. As such, the paper is concluded by a statement of limitations for those wishing to replicate part or all of its content.",

    "summary": "The demand for quality in mobile applications has increased greatly given users' high reliance on them for daily tasks. Developers work tirelessly to ensure that their applications are both functional and user-friendly. In pursuit of this, Automated Input Generation (AIG) tools have emerged as a promising solution for testing mobile applications by simulating user interactions and exploring app functionalities. However, these tools face significant challenges in navigating complex Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), and developers often have trouble understanding their output. More specifically, AIG tools face difficulties in navigating out of certain screens, such as login pages and advertisements, due to a lack of contextual understanding which leads to suboptimal testing coverage. Furthermore, while AIG tools can provide interaction traces consisting of action and screen details, there is limited understanding of its coverage of higher level functionalities, such as logging in, setting alarms, or saving notes. Understanding these covered use cases are essential to ensure comprehensive test coverage of app functionalities. Difficulty in testing mobile UIs can lead to the design of complex interfaces, which can adversely affect users of advanced age who often face usability barriers due to small buttons, cluttered layouts, and unintuitive navigation. There exists many studies that highlight these issues, but automated solutions for improving UI accessibility needs more attention. This research seeks to enhance automated UI testing techniques by learning the screen usage semantics of mobile apps and helping them navigate more efficiently, offer more insights about tested functionalities and also improve the usability of a mobile app's interface by identifying and mitigating UI design issues.",

    "summary": "Automating the synthesis of User Interfaces (UIs) plays a crucial role in enhancing productivity and accelerating the development lifecycle, reducing both development time and manual effort. Recently, the rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made it possible to generate front-end Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code directly from webpage designs. However, real-world webpages encompass not only a diverse array of HTML tags but also complex stylesheets, resulting in significantly lengthy code. The lengthy code poses challenges for the performance and efficiency of MLLMs, especially in capturing the structural information of UI designs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes UICopilot, a novel approach to automating UI synthesis via hierarchical code generation from webpage designs. The core idea of UICopilot is to decompose the generation process into two stages: first, generating the coarse-grained HTML hierarchical structure, followed by the generation of fine-grained code. To validate the effectiveness of UICopilot, we conduct experiments on a real-world dataset, i.e., WebCode2M. Experimental results demonstrate that UICopilot significantly outperforms existing baselines in both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluations. Specifically, statistical analysis reveals that the majority of human annotators prefer the webpages generated by UICopilot over those produced by GPT-4V.",

We show that essential properties like anonymity and uniformity can be encoded and verified within this framework in a manner aligning with the principles of deductive software verification, where systems, properties, and proofs are expressed in a unified decidable logic. By integrating language inference techniques, we achieve full automation in synthesizing candidate bisimulation proofs for anonymity and uniformity. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by addressing several challenging examples, including cryptographic protocols and randomized algorithms that were previously beyond the reach of fully automated methods.",

    "summary": "Context: Software vulnerability assessment (SVA) is critical for identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing security weaknesses in software applications. Objective: Despite the increasing application of large language models (LLMs) in various software engineering tasks, their effectiveness in SVA remains underexplored. Method: To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach SVA-ICL, which leverages in-context learning (ICL) to enhance LLM performance. Our approach involves the selection of high-quality demonstrations for ICL through information fusion, incorporating both source code and vulnerability descriptions. For source code, we consider semantic, lexical, and syntactic similarities, while for vulnerability descriptions, we focus on textual similarity. Based on the selected demonstrations, we construct context prompts and consider DeepSeek-V2 as the LLM for SVA-ICL. Results: We evaluate the effectiveness of SVA-ICL using a large-scale dataset comprising 12,071 C/C++ vulnerabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that SVA-ICL outperforms state-of-the-art SVA baselines in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and MCC measures. Furthermore, ablation studies highlight the significance of component customization in SVA-ICL, such as the number of demonstrations, the demonstration ordering strategy, and the optimal fusion ratio of different modalities. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that leveraging ICL with information fusion can effectively improve the effectiveness of LLM-based SVA, warranting further research in this direction.",

This has thus caused a spotlight to be paced on these resources, where researchers have reported mixed outcomes around the quality of these resources. Stack Overflow, in particular, has been studied extensively, with evidence showing that code resources on this platform can be of poor quality at times. Limited research has explored the variables or factors that predict code quality on Stack Overflow, but instead has focused on ranking content, identifying defects and predicting future content. In many instances approaches used for prediction are not evaluated to identify the best techniques. Contextualizing the Stack Overflow code quality problem as regression-based, we examined the variables that predict Stack Overflow (Java) code quality, and the regression approach that provides the best predictive power. Six approaches were considered in our evaluation, where Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) stood out. In addition, longer Stack Overflow code tended to have more code violations, questions that were scored higher also attracted more views and the more answers that are added to questions on Stack Overflow the more errors were typically observed in the code that was provided. Outcomes here point to the value of the GBM ensemble learning mechanism, and the need for the practitioner community to be prudent when contributing and reusing Stack Overflow Java coding resource.",

Drawing from an Action Research case study at a global Swedish enterprise, we identify and address critical barriers such as departmental fragmentation, regulatory constraints, and organizational inertia that can impede successful AI transformation. X-FAIT employs force field analysis, executive sponsorship, cross-functional integration, and systematic risk assessment strategies to coordinate efforts across organizational boundaries, facilitating knowledge sharing and ensuring AI initiatives align with objectives. The framework provides both theoretical insights into AI-driven organizational transformation and practical guidance for software organizations aiming to effectively integrate AI into their daily workflows and, longer-term, products.",

    "summary": "The research examines the challenges revolving around young people's social movements, activism regarding sustainability, as well as the accompanying social media aspect, and how social media impacts environmental action. This study focuses on the environmental craze on social media platforms and its impact on young activists aged 16-25. With the advancement of social media, new avenues have opened for participation in sustainability issues, especially for the marginalized, as information moved through transnational networks at lightning speed. Along with specific Formative Visual Storytelling methods, the young leaders of the movement deploy hashtags and other online tools to capture the attention of their peers and decision makers. Challenges persist with \"clicktivism\" fatigue from the internet, and site limitations. This article contributes to insights on emerging forms of civic activism by explaining how digital natives adapt technology to reframe green activism. The research suggests that effective digital environmental movements integrate online and offline action, make it simple for individuals to get involved, and promote tolerance to algorithmic modifications and climate care among participants.",

    "summary": "Software vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and SQL injections are a major source of security breaches. Traditional methods for vulnerability detection remain essential but are limited by high false positive rates, scalability issues, and reliance on manual effort. These constraints have driven interest in AI-based approaches to automated vulnerability detection and secure code generation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for classification tasks, their complexity and opacity pose challenges for interpretability and deployment. Sparse Autoencoder offer a promising solution to this problem. We explore whether SAEs can serve as a lightweight, interpretable alternative for bug detection in Java functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of SAEs when applied to representations from GPT-2 Small and Gemma 2B, examining their capacity to highlight buggy behaviour without fine-tuning the underlying LLMs. We found that SAE-derived features enable bug detection with an F1 score of up to 89%, consistently outperforming fine-tuned transformer encoder baselines. Our work provides the first empirical evidence that SAEs can be used to detect software bugs directly from the internal representations of pretrained LLMs, without any fine-tuning or task-specific supervision.",

    "summary": "Understanding the reasoning and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for their reliable use in programming tasks. While recent studies have assessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the accuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them. Moreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar issues in code understanding.\nIn this work, we evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B parameters can reason about Python programs or are simply guessing. We apply five semantics-preserving code mutations: renaming variables, mirroring comparison expressions, swapping if-else branches, converting for loops to while, and loop unrolling. These mutations maintain program semantics while altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and performed a human expert analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the correct predictions are based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction stability across different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our findings show that some LLMs, such as Llama3.2, produce correct predictions based on flawed reasoning in up to 61% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change predictions in response to our code mutations, indicating limited robustness in their semantic understanding.",

    "summary": "With the advent of neural language models, the performance of code generation has been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions, thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the best-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of generated code.",

    "summary": "Within the realm of software engineering, specialized tasks on code, such as program repair, present unique challenges, necessitating fine-tuning Large language models~(LLMs) to unlock state-of-the-art performance. Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective 1), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective 2). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches. We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.",

    "summary": "Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs) rely on Deep Neural Networks, allowing vehicles to navigate complex, open environments. However, the unpredictability of these scenarios highlights the need for rigorous system-level testing to ensure safety, a task usually performed with a simulator in the loop. Though one important goal of such testing is to detect safety violations, there are many undesirable system behaviors, that may not immediately lead to violations, that testing should also be focusing on, thus detecting more subtle problems and enabling a finer-grained analysis. This paper introduces Cooperative Co-evolutionary MEtamorphic test Generator for Autonomous systems (CoCoMEGA), a novel automated testing framework aimed at advancing system-level safety assessments of ADSs. CoCoMEGA combines Metamorphic Testing (MT) with a search-based approach utilizing Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Algorithms (CCEA) to efficiently generate a diverse set of test cases. CoCoMEGA emphasizes the identification of test scenarios that present undesirable system behavior, that may eventually lead to safety violations, captured by Metamorphic Relations (MRs). When evaluated within the CARLA simulation environment on the Interfuser ADS, CoCoMEGA consistently outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness and efficiency in generating severe, diverse MR violations and achieving broader exploration of the test space. These results underscore CoCoMEGA as a promising, more scalable solution to the inherent challenges in ADS testing with a simulator in the loop. Future research directions may include extending the approach to additional simulation platforms, applying it to other complex systems, and exploring methods for further improving testing efficiency such as surrogate modeling.",

    "summary": "In software applications, user models can be used to specify the profile of the typical users of the application, including personality traits, preferences, skills, etc. In theory, this would enable an adaptive application behavior that could lead to a better user experience. Nevertheless, user models do not seem to be part of standard modeling languages nor common in current model-driven engineering (MDE) approaches. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review to analyze existing proposals for user modeling in MDE and identify their limitations. The results showcase that there is a lack of a unified and complete user modeling perspective. Instead, we observe a lot of fragmented and partial proposals considering only simple user dimensions and with lack of proper tool support. This limits the implementation of richer user interfaces able to better support the user-specific needs. Therefore, we hope this analysis triggers a discussion on the importance of user models and their inclusion in MDE pipelines. Especially in a context where, thanks to the rise of AI techniques, personalization, based on a rich number of user dimensions, is becoming more and more of a possibility.",

Although many tools generate UML diagrams from UML code, generating executable UML code from image-based UML diagrams remains challenging.

Synthetic UML activity and sequence diagram datasets were created to train and test the model. We compared standard fine-tuning with LoRA techniques to optimize base models. The experiments measured code generation accuracy across different model sizes and training strategies. These results demonstrated that domain-adapted MM-LLMs perform for UML code generation automation, whereby, at the best model, it achieved BLEU and SSIM scores of 0.779 and 0.942 on sequence diagrams. This will enable the modernization of legacy systems and decrease the manual effort in software development workflows.",

However, managing the configuration differences between these two environments can be challenging, leading to inconsistent behavior, unexpected errors, and increased downtime. Objective: In this study, we sought to investigate the strategies software companies employ to mitigate the configuration differences between the development and production environments. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of these strategies used to contribute to reducing the risk of configuration-related issues. Method: To achieve this goal, we interviewed 17 participants and leveraged the Thematic Analysis methodology to analyze the interview data. These participants shed some light on the current practices, processes, challenges, or issues they have encountered. Results: Based on the interviews, we systematically formulated and structured a catalog of eight strategies that explain how software producing companies mitigate these configuration differences. These strategies vary from 1) creating detailed configuration management plans, 2) using automation tools, and 3) developing processes to test and validate changes through containers and virtualization technologies. Conclusion: By implementing these strategies, companies can improve their ability to respond quickly and effectively to changes in the production environment. In addition, they can also ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations.",

While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in generating general 3D scenes from textual descriptions, generating industrial scenes with LLMs poses a unique challenge due to their demand for precise measurements and positioning, requiring complex planning over spatial arrangement. To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an LLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent ensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format, layout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative requirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs powered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to 81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and effectively meeting most scene generation requirements. To further enhance accessibility, we construct SceneInstruct, a dataset designed for fine-tuning open-source LLMs to integrate into SceneGenAgent. Experiments show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on SceneInstruct yields significant performance improvements, with Llama3.1-70B approaching the capabilities of GPT-4o.

    "summary": "Wildfires have become increasingly frequent, irregular, and severe in recent years. Understanding how affected populations perceive and respond during wildfire crises is critical for timely and empathetic disaster response. Social media platforms offer a crowd-sourced channel to capture evolving public discourse, providing hyperlocal information and insight into public sentiment. This study analyzes Reddit discourse during the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires, spanning from the onset of the disaster to full containment. We collect 385 posts and 114,879 comments related to the Palisades and Eaton fires. We adopt topic modeling methods to identify the latent topics, enhanced by large language models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop (HITL) refinement. Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical framework to categorize latent topics, consisting of two main categories, Situational Awareness (SA) and Crisis Narratives (CN). The volume of SA category closely aligns with real-world fire progressions, peaking within the first 2-5 days as the fires reach the maximum extent. The most frequent co-occurring category set of public health and safety, loss and damage, and emergency resources expands on a wide range of health-related latent topics, including environmental health, occupational health, and one health. Grief signals and mental health risks consistently accounted for 60 percentage and 40 percentage of CN instances, respectively, with the highest total volume occurring at night. This study contributes the first annotated social media dataset on the 2025 LA fires, and introduces a scalable multi-layer framework that leverages topic modeling for crisis discourse analysis. By identifying persistent public health concerns, our results can inform more empathetic and adaptive strategies for disaster response, public health communication, and future research in comparable climate-related disaster events.",

    "summary": "Community detection, a vital technology for real-world applications, uncovers cohesive node groups (communities) by leveraging both topological and attribute similarities in social networks. However, existing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) trained to maximize modularity often converge to suboptimal solutions. Additionally, directly using human-labeled communities for training can undermine topological cohesiveness by grouping disconnected nodes based solely on node attributes. We address these issues by proposing a novel Topological and Attributive Similarity-based Community detection (TAS-Com) method. TAS-Com introduces a novel loss function that exploits the highly effective and scalable Leiden algorithm to detect community structures with global optimal modularity. Leiden is further utilized to refine human-labeled communities to ensure connectivity within each community, enabling TAS-Com to detect community structures with desirable trade-offs between modularity and compliance with human labels. Experimental results on multiple benchmark networks confirm that TAS-Com can significantly outperform several state-of-the-art algorithms.",

    "summary": "Major social media platforms increasingly adopt community-based fact-checking to address misinformation on their platforms. While previous research has largely focused on its effect on engagement (e.g., reposts, likes), an understanding of how fact-checking affects a user's follower base is missing. In this study, we employ quasi-experimental methods to causally assess whether users lose followers after their posts are corrected via community fact-checks. Based on time-series data on follower counts for N=3516 community fact-checked posts from X, we find that community fact-checks do not lead to meaningful declines in the follower counts of users who post misleading content. This suggests that followers of spreaders of misleading posts tend to remain loyal and do not view community fact-checks as a sufficient reason to disengage. Our findings underscore the need for complementary interventions to more effectively disincentivize the production of misinformation on social media.",

However, prior research has largely focused on its potential societal consequences rather than its real-world prevalence. In this study, we conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of AI-generated misinformation on the social media platform X. Specifically, we analyze a dataset comprising N=91,452 misleading posts, both AI-generated and non-AI-generated, that have been identified and flagged through X's Community Notes platform. Our analysis yields four main findings: (i) AI-generated misinformation is more often centered on entertaining content and tends to exhibit a more positive sentiment than conventional forms of misinformation, (ii) it is more likely to originate from smaller user accounts, (iii) despite this, it is significantly more likely to go viral, and (iv) it is slightly less believable and harmful compared to conventional misinformation. Altogether, our findings highlight the unique characteristics of AI-generated misinformation on social media. We discuss important implications for platforms and future research.",

    "summary": "Counting $(p,q)$-bicliques in bipartite graphs is crucial for a variety of applications, from recommendation systems to cohesive subgraph analysis. Yet, it remains computationally challenging due to the combinatorial explosion to exactly count the $(p,q)$-bicliques. In many scenarios, e.g., graph kernel methods, however, exact counts are not strictly required. To design a scalable and high-quality approximate solution, we novelly resort to $(p,q)$-broom, a special spanning tree of the $(p,q)$-biclique, which can be counted via graph coloring and efficient dynamic programming. Based on the intermediate results of the dynamic programming, we propose an efficient sampling algorithm to derive the approximate $(p,q)$-biclique count from the $(p,q)$-broom counts. Theoretically, our method offers unbiased estimates with provable error guarantees. Empirically, our solution outperforms existing approximation techniques in both accuracy (up to 8$\\times$ error reduction) and runtime (up to 50$\\times$ speedup) on nine real-world bipartite networks, providing a scalable solution for large-scale $(p,q)$-biclique counting.",

Our model is grounded in an underlying directed signed graph, where each link is associated with a weight that describes the strenght and nature of the interaction. The utility for each agent is an aggregation of pairwise terms determined by the weights of the signed graph in addition to an individual bias term. We consider a scenario that assumes the presence of a prominent 'cohesive' subset of players, who are either connected exclusively by positive weights, or forms a structurally balanced subset that can be bipartitioned into two adversarial subcommunities with positive intra-community and negative inter-community edges. Given the properties of the game restricted to the remaining players, our results guarantee the existence of Nash equilibria characterized by a consensus or, respectively, a polarization within the first group, as well as their stability under best response transitions. Our results can be interpreted as robustness results, building on the supermodular properties of coordination games and on a novel use of the concept of graph cohesiveness.",

    "summary": "As demand for intelligent services rises and edge devices become more capable, distributed learning at the network edge has emerged as a key enabling technology. While existing paradigms like federated learning (FL) and decentralized FL (DFL) enable privacy-preserving distributed learning in many scenarios, they face potential challenges in connectivity and synchronization imposed by resource-constrained and infrastructure-less environments. While more robust, gossip learning (GL) algorithms have generally been designed for homogeneous data distributions and may not suit all contexts. This paper introduces Chisme, a novel suite of protocols designed to address the challenges of implementing robust intelligence in the network edge, characterized by heterogeneous data distributions, episodic connectivity, and lack of infrastructure. Chisme includes both synchronous DFL (Chisme-DFL) and asynchronous GL (Chisme-GL) variants that enable collaborative yet decentralized model training that considers underlying data heterogeneity. We introduce a data similarity heuristic that allows agents to opportunistically infer affinity with each other using the existing communication of model updates in decentralized FL and GL. We leverage the heuristic to extend DFL's model aggregation and GL's model merge mechanisms for better personalized training while maintaining collaboration. While Chisme-DFL is a synchronous decentralized approach whose resource utilization scales linearly with network size, Chisme-GL is fully asynchronous and has a lower, constant resource requirement independent of network size. We demonstrate that Chisme methods outperform their standard counterparts in model training over distributed and heterogeneous data in network scenarios ranging from less connected and reliable networks to fully connected and lossless networks.",

    "summary": "Commonsense intelligence in machines is often assessed by static benchmarks that compare a model's output against human-prescribed correct labels. An important, albeit implicit, assumption of these labels is that they accurately capture what any human would think, effectively treating human common sense as homogeneous. However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary enormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident to one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a novel method for evaluating common sense in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically observed heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a model's judgment and that of a human population. We first find that, when treated as independent survey respondents, most LLMs remain below the human median in their individual commonsense competence. Second, when used as simulators of a hypothetical population, LLMs correlate with real humans only modestly in the extent to which they agree on the same set of statements. In both cases, smaller, open-weight models are surprisingly more competitive than larger, proprietary frontier models. Our evaluation framework, which ties commonsense intelligence to its cultural basis, contributes to the growing call for adapting AI models to human collectivities that possess different, often incompatible, social stocks of knowledge.",

Among the former, Exponential Random Graphs (ERGs) have gained increasing attention over the years. So far, only linear ERGs have been extensively employed to gain insight into the structural organisation of real-world complex networks. None, however, is capable of accounting for the variance of the empirical degree distribution. To this aim, non-linear ERGs must be considered. After showing that the usual mean-field approximation forces the degree-corrected version of the two-star model to degenerate, we define a fitness-induced variant of it. Such a `softened' model is capable of reproducing the sample variance, while retaining the explanatory power of its linear counterpart, within a purely canonical framework.",

    "summary": "Human networks greatly impact important societal outcomes, including wealth and health inequality, poverty, and bullying. As such, understanding human networks is critical to learning how to promote favorable societal outcomes. As a step toward better understanding human networks, we compare and contrast several methods for learning, from a small data set, models of human behavior in a strategic network game called the Junior High Game (JHG). These modeling methods differ with respect to the assumptions they use to parameterize human behavior (behavior vs. community-aware behavior) and the moments they model (mean vs. distribution). Results show that the highest-performing method, called hCAB, models the distribution of human behavior rather than the mean and assumes humans use community-aware behavior rather than behavior matching. When applied to small societies (6-11 individuals), the hCAB model closely mirrors the population dynamics of human groups (with notable differences). Additionally, in a user study, human participants were unable to distinguish individual hCAB agents from other humans, thus illustrating that the hCAB model also produces plausible (individual) human behavior in this strategic network game.",

However, many of these methods are hard to study theoretically, and they optimise for somewhat different goals. A general and rigorous account of the problem and possible methods remains elusive.\nWe study the problem of finding overlapping clusterings of hypergraphs, continuing the line of research started by Carlsson and M√©moli (2013) of classifying clustering schemes as functors. We extend their notion of representability to the overlapping case, showing that any representable overlapping clustering scheme is excisive and functorial, and any excisive and functorial clustering scheme is isomorphic to a representable clustering scheme.\nWe also note that, for simple graphs, any representable clustering scheme is computable in polynomial time on graphs of bounded expansion, with an exponent determined by the maximum independence number of a graph in the representing set. This result also applies to non-overlapping representable clustering schemes, and so may be of independent interest.",

    "summary": "Graph domain adaptation has recently enabled knowledge transfer across different graphs. However, without the semantic information on target graphs, the performance on target graphs is still far from satisfactory. To address the issue, we study the problem of active graph domain adaptation, which selects a small quantitative of informative nodes on the target graph for extra annotation. This problem is highly challenging due to the complicated topological relationships and the distribution discrepancy across graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Dual Consistency Delving with Topological Uncertainty (DELTA) for active graph domain adaptation. Our DELTA consists of an edge-oriented graph subnetwork and a path-oriented graph subnetwork, which can explore topological semantics from complementary perspectives. In particular, our edge-oriented graph subnetwork utilizes the message passing mechanism to learn neighborhood information, while our path-oriented graph subnetwork explores high-order relationships from sub-structures. To jointly learn from two subnetworks, we roughly select informative candidate nodes with the consideration of consistency across two subnetworks. Then, we aggregate local semantics from its K-hop subgraph based on node degrees for topological uncertainty estimation. To overcome potential distribution shifts, we compare target nodes and their corresponding source nodes for discrepancy scores as an additional component for fine selection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DELTA outperforms various state-of-the-art approaches. The code implementation of DELTA is available at this https URL.",

    "summary": "Graph pooling compresses graphs and summarises their topological properties and features in a vectorial representation. It is an essential part of deep graph representation learning and is indispensable in graph-level tasks like classification or regression. Current approaches pool hierarchical structures in graphs by iteratively applying shallow pooling operators up to a fixed depth. However, they disregard the interdependencies between structures at different hierarchical levels and do not adapt to datasets that contain graphs with different sizes that may require pooling with various depths. To address these issues, we propose MDL-Pool, a pooling operator based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle, whose loss formulation explicitly models the interdependencies between different hierarchical levels and facilitates a direct comparison between multiple pooling alternatives with different depths. MDP-Pool builds on the map equation, an information-theoretic objective function for community detection, which naturally implements Occam's razor and balances between model complexity and goodness-of-fit via the MDL. We demonstrate MDL-Pool's competitive performance in an empirical evaluation against various baselines across standard graph classification datasets.",

    "summary": "A temporal network -- a collection of snapshots recording the evolution of a network whose links appear and disappear dynamically -- can be interpreted as a trajectory in graph space. In order to characterize the complex dynamics of such trajectory via the tools of time series analysis and signal processing, it is sensible to preprocess the trajectory by embedding it in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Here we argue that, rather than the topological structure of each network snapshot, the main property of the trajectory that needs to be preserved in the embedding is the relative graph distance between snapshots. This idea naturally leads to dimensionality reduction approaches that explicitly consider relative distances, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) or identifying the distance matrix as a feature matrix in which to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This paper provides a comprehensible methodology that illustrates this approach. Its application to a suite of generative network trajectory models and empirical data certify that nontrivial dynamical properties of the network trajectories are preserved already in their scalar embeddings, what enables the possibility of performing time series analysis in temporal networks.",

    "summary": "Maximizing a single submodular set function subject to a cardinality constraint is a well-studied and central topic in combinatorial optimization. However, finding a set that maximizes multiple functions at the same time is much less understood, even though it is a formulation which naturally occurs in robust maximization or problems with fairness considerations such as fair influence maximization or fair allocation.\nIn this work, we consider the problem of maximizing the minimum over many submodular functions, which is known as multiobjective submodular maximization. All known polynomial-time approximation algorithms either obtain a weak approximation guarantee or rely on the evaluation of the multilinear extension. The latter is expensive to evaluate and renders such algorithms impractical. We bridge this gap and introduce the first scalable and practical algorithm that obtains the best-known approximation guarantee. We furthermore introduce a novel application fair centrality maximization and show how it can be addressed via multiobjective submodular maximization. In our experimental evaluation, we show that our algorithm outperforms known algorithms in terms of objective value and running time.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a risk-aware safe reinforcement learning (RL) control design for stochastic discrete-time linear systems. Rather than using a safety certifier to myopically intervene with the RL controller, a risk-informed safe controller is also learned besides the RL controller, and the RL and safe controllers are combined together. Several advantages come along with this approach: 1) High-confidence safety can be certified without relying on a high-fidelity system model and using limited data available, 2) Myopic interventions and convergence to an undesired equilibrium can be avoided by deciding on the contribution of two stabilizing controllers, and 3) highly efficient and computationally tractable solutions can be provided by optimizing over a scalar decision variable and linear programming polyhedral sets. To learn safe controllers with a large invariant set, piecewise affine controllers are learned instead of linear controllers. To this end, the closed-loop system is first represented using collected data, a decision variable, and noise. The effect of the decision variable on the variance of the safe violation of the closed-loop system is formalized. The decision variable is then designed such that the probability of safety violation for the learned closed-loop system is minimized. It is shown that this control-oriented approach reduces the data requirements and can also reduce the variance of safety violations. Finally, to integrate the safe and RL controllers, a new data-driven interpolation technique is introduced. This method aims to maintain the RL agent's optimal implementation while ensuring its safety within environments characterized by noise. The study concludes with a simulation example that serves to validate the theoretical results.",

    "summary": "While electric vehicles (EVs) often exhibit substantial flexibility, harnessing this flexibility requires precise characterization of its timing and magnitude. This paper introduces the reduction potential matrix, a novel approach to EV load flexibility modeling which is both straightforward to calculate and intuitive to interpret. This paper demonstrates the approach by quantifying flexibility for two distinct commercial vehicle groups--freight vehicles and transit buses--using simulated charging data from Virginia. While both groups are found to have substantial flexibility, its properties vary across the groups. Naturally, this variability manifests in differences in each group's role as a grid resource. The paper concludes with a discussion on how system planners, fleet operators, and other stakeholders can use the matrix to assess and leverage EV flexibility.",

    "summary": "Executing a control sequence requires some computation effort. Intuitively, a high-effort, fine-grained computation should result in better control (e.g. lower cost), whereas little to no computation effort would lead to worse control. To quantify and explore the tradeoff between control performance and compute effort, we present the Path Integral Bottleneck (PIB), a fusion of the Path Integral (PI) optimal control and Information Bottleneck (IB) frameworks. Both frameworks provide flexible and probabilistic descriptions of control. The PI does not limit itself to a particular control law, and the IB is not bound to any specific state encoding. Combining the generality of both frameworks enables us to produce an analytical description of the control-compute tradeoff. We provide PIB formulations for both continuous and discrete random variables. With these formulations, we can plot a tradeoff curve between performance and computation effort for any given plant description and control cost function. Simulations of a cart-pole for both the continuous and discrete variable cases reveal fundamental control-compute tradeoffs, exposing regions where the task performance-per-compute is higher than others.",

    "summary": "Trajectory planning is essential for ensuring safe driving in the face of uncertainties related to communication, sensing, and dynamic factors such as weather, road conditions, policies, and other road users. Existing car-following models often lack rigorous safety proofs and the ability to replicate human-like driving behaviors consistently. This article applies multi-phase dynamical systems analysis to well-known car-following models to highlight the characteristics and limitations of existing approaches. We begin by formulating fundamental principles for safe and human-like car-following behaviors, which include zeroth-order principles for comfort and minimum jam spacings, first-order principles for speeds and time gaps, and second-order principles for comfort acceleration/deceleration bounds as well as braking profiles. From a set of these zeroth- and first-order principles, we derive Newell's simplified car-following model. Subsequently, we analyze phases within the speed-spacing plane for the stationary lead-vehicle problem in Newell's model and its extensions, which incorporate both bounded acceleration and deceleration. We then analyze the performance of the Intelligent Driver Model and the Gipps model. Through this analysis, we highlight the limitations of these models with respect to some of the aforementioned principles. Numerical simulations and empirical observations validate the theoretical insights. Finally, we discuss future research directions to further integrate safety, human-like behaviors, and vehicular automation in car-following models, which are addressed in Part 2 of this study \\citep{jin2025WA20-02_Part2}, where we develop a novel multi-phase projection-based car-following model that addresses the limitations identified here.",

    "summary": "Ensuring safe and human-like trajectory planning for automated vehicles amidst real-world uncertainties remains a critical challenge. While existing car-following models often struggle to consistently provide rigorous safety proofs alongside human-like acceleration and deceleration patterns, we introduce a novel multi-phase projection-based car-following model. This model is designed to balance safety and performance by incorporating bounded acceleration and deceleration rates while emulating key human driving principles. Building upon a foundation of fundamental driving principles and a multi-phase dynamical systems analysis (detailed in Part 1 of this study \\citep{jin2025WA20-02_Part1}), we first highlight the limitations of extending standard models like Newell's with simple bounded deceleration. Inspired by human drivers' anticipatory behavior, we mathematically define and analyze projected braking profiles for both leader and follower vehicles, establishing safety criteria and new phase definitions based on the projected braking lead-vehicle problem. The proposed parsimonious model combines an extended Newell's model for nominal driving with a new control law for scenarios requiring projected braking. Using speed-spacing phase plane analysis, we provide rigorous mathematical proofs of the model's adherence to defined safe and human-like driving principles, including collision-free operation, bounded deceleration, and acceptable safe stopping distance, under reasonable initial conditions. Numerical simulations validate the model's superior performance in achieving both safety and human-like braking profiles for the stationary lead-vehicle problem.

However, it becomes intractable for high-dimensional problems due to the curse of dimensionality. Dimensionality reduction approaches are essential for mitigating this challenge, whereas they could introduce the ``leaking corner issue\", leading to inaccuracies in the results. In this paper, we define the ``leaking corner issue\" in terms of value functions, propose and prove a necessary condition for its occurrence. We then use these theoretical contributions to introduce a new local updating method that efficiently corrects inaccurate value functions while maintaining the computational efficiency of the dimensionality reduction approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through numerical simulations. Although we validate our method with the self-contained subsystem decomposition (SCSD), our approach is applicable to other dimensionality reduction techniques that introduce the ``leaking corners\".",

    "summary": "A planar herding problem is considered, where a superior pursuer herds a flock of non-cooperative, inferior evaders around a predefined target point. An inverse square law of repulsion is assumed between the pursuer and each evader. Two classes of pursuer trajectories are proposed: (i) a constant angular-velocity spiral, and (ii) a constant angular-velocity circle, both centered around the target point. For the spiraling pursuer, the radial velocity is dynamically adjusted based on a feedback law that depends on the instantaneous position of the evader, which is located at the farthest distance from the target at the start of the game. It is shown that, under suitable choices of the model parameters, all the evaders are herded into an arbitrarily small limit cycle around the target point. Meanwhile, the pursuer also converges onto a circular trajectory around the target. The conditions for the stability of these limit cycles are derived. For the circling pursuer, similar guarantees are provided along with explicit formulas for the radii of the limit cycles.",

To that end, one needs to assess the criticality of key network components (buses and lines) in terms of their impact on system performance. Traditional methods to identify the key nodes/edges in power networks often rely on static centrality measures based on the network's topological structure ignoring the network's dynamic behavior. In this paper, using multi-machine power network models and a new control-theoretic edge centrality matrix (ECM) approach, we: (i) quantify the influence of edges (i.e., the line susceptances) in terms of controllability performance metrics, (ii) identify the most influential lines, and (iii) compute near-optimal edge modifications that improve the power network controllability. Employing various IEEE power network benchmarks, we validate the effectiveness of the ECM-based algorithm and demonstrate improvements in system reachability, control, and damping performance.",

Going beyond the conventional ideation, this article unleashes innate computational abilities in the power grid network circuits itself. By programming power electronic converters (PECs) to mimic biological neurons, we sustainably transform power grids into a neural network and enable it to optimize, compute and make data-driven decisions using distributed PECs. Instead of seen merely as an energy delivery platform, this article conceptualizes a novel application for electric grid to be used as a computing asset without affecting its operation. To illustrate its computational abilities, we solve a affine transformation task in a microgrid with five PECs. By encoding the digital data into the control of PECs, our preliminary results conclude that computing using electric grids does not disturb its operation. From a scientific perspective, this work fundamentally merges energy and computing optimization theories by harnessing inherent high-dimensional computational relationships in electric grids.",

    "summary": "We study binary-action pairwise-separable network games that encompass both coordinating and anti-coordinating behaviors. Our model is grounded in an underlying directed signed graph, where each link is associated with a weight that describes the strenght and nature of the interaction. The utility for each agent is an aggregation of pairwise terms determined by the weights of the signed graph in addition to an individual bias term. We consider a scenario that assumes the presence of a prominent 'cohesive' subset of players, who are either connected exclusively by positive weights, or forms a structurally balanced subset that can be bipartitioned into two adversarial subcommunities with positive intra-community and negative inter-community edges. Given the properties of the game restricted to the remaining players, our results guarantee the existence of Nash equilibria characterized by a consensus or, respectively, a polarization within the first group, as well as their stability under best response transitions. Our results can be interpreted as robustness results, building on the supermodular properties of coordination games and on a novel use of the concept of graph cohesiveness.",

    "summary": "State-of-the-art upper limb myoelectric prostheses often use pattern recognition (PR) control systems that translate electromyography (EMG) signals into desired movements. As prosthesis movement complexity increases, users often struggle to produce sufficiently distinct EMG patterns for reliable classification. Existing training typically involves heuristic, trial-and-error user adjustments to static decoder boundaries. Goal: We introduce the Reviewer, a 3D visual interface projecting EMG signals directly into the decoder's classification space, providing intuitive, real-time insight into PR algorithm behavior. This structured feedback reduces cognitive load and fosters mutual, data-driven adaptation between user-generated EMG patterns and decoder boundaries. Methods: A 10-session study with 12 able-bodied participants compared PR performance after motor-based training and updating using the Reviewer versus conventional virtual arm visualization. Performance was assessed using a Fitts law task that involved the aperture of the cursor and the control of orientation. Results: Participants trained with the Reviewer achieved higher completion rates, reduced overshoot, and improved path efficiency and throughput compared to the standard visualization group. Significance: The Reviewer introduces decoder-informed motor training, facilitating immediate and consistent PR-based myoelectric control improvements. By iteratively refining control through real-time feedback, this approach reduces reliance on trial-and-error recalibration, enabling a more adaptive, self-correcting training framework. Conclusion: The 3D visual feedback significantly improves PR control in novice operators through structured training, enabling feedback-driven adaptation and reducing reliance on extensive heuristic adjustments.",

    "summary": "This paper explores the application of Hamilton's rule to altruistic decision-making in multi-agent systems. Inspired by biological altruism, we introduce a framework that evaluates when individual agents should incur costs to benefit their neighbors. By adapting Hamilton's rule, we define agent ``fitness\" in terms of task productivity rather than genetic survival. We formalize altruistic decision-making through a graph-based model of multi-agent interactions and propose a solution using collaborative control Lyapunov functions. The approach ensures that altruistic behaviors contribute to the collective goal-reaching efficiency of the system. We illustrate this framework on a multi-agent way-point navigation problem, where we show through simulation how agent importance levels influence altruistic decision-making, leading to improved coordination in navigation tasks.",

    "summary": "Conformal phased arrays promise shape-changing properties, multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, and novel applications in wearables, aerospace, defense, vehicles, and ships. However, they have suffered from two critical limitations. (1) Although most applications require on-the-move communication and sensing, prior conformal arrays have suffered from dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. We introduce a Dynamic Beam-Stabilized (DBS) processor capable of beam adaptation through on-chip real-time control of fundamental gain, phase, and delay for each element. (2) Prior conformal arrays have leveraged additive printing to enhance flexibility, but conventional printable inks based on silver are expensive, and those based on copper suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. We instead leverage a low-cost Copper Molecular Decomposition (CuMOD) ink with < 0.1% variation per degree C with temperature and strain and correct any residual deformity in real-time using the DBS processor. Demonstrating unified material and physical deformation correction, our CMOS DBS processor is low power, low-area, and easily scalable due to a tile architecture, thereby ideal for on-device implementations.",

We present a geometric and mechanical framework for Yoshimura-Ori modules that supports a diverse set of metastable states, including newly identified asymmetric \"pop-out\" and \"hyperfolded\" configurations. These states are governed by three parameters -- tilt angle, phase shift, and slant height -- and enable discrete, programmable transformations. Using this model, we develop forward and inverse kinematic strategies to stack modules into deployable booms that approximate complex 3D shapes. We validate our approach through mechanical tests and demonstrate a tendon- and pneumatically-actuated Yoshimura Space Crane capable of object manipulation, solar tracking, and high load-bearing performance. A meter-scale solar charging station further illustrates the design's scalability. These results establish Yoshimura-Ori structures as a promising platform for adaptable, multifunctional deployable systems in both terrestrial and space environments.",

Our method partitions the workspace, assigns fruit-picking sequences to arms, determines tight and feasible fruit-picking schedules and vehicle travel speed, and generates smooth, collision-free arm trajectories. The fruit-picking throughput achieved by the algorithm was assessed using synthetically generated fruit coordinates and a harvester design featuring up to 12 arms. The throughput increased monotonically as more arms were added. Adding more arms when fruit densities were low resulted in diminishing gains because it took longer to travel from one fruit to another. However, when there were enough fruits, the proposed algorithm achieved a linear speedup as the number of arms increased.",

This paper addresses this issue by investigating the combined use of angle diversity receivers (ADRs) and optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) in multiuser VLC systems. We consider ORIS elements as small movable mirrors. We demonstrate the complementarity of ADR and ORIS in mitigating link blockages, as well as the advantages of using a larger number of ORIS elements due to the increased field-of-view (FoV) at the receiver enabled by the ADR. An optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize the minimum signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) to deploy a fair communication network. Numerical results show that integrating ADR and ORIS significantly enhances VLC communication performance, achieving an SNR gain of up to 30 dB compared to a system without ORIS, and mitigating communication outages produced by link blockages or out-of-FoV received signals. We also prove that an ADR with a single tier of photodiodes is sufficient to complement ORIS-assisted VLC.",

    "summary": "A universal quantum computer~(QC), though promising ground breaking solutions to complex problems, still faces several challenges with respect to scalability. Current state-of-the-art QC use a great quantity of cables to connect the physical qubits, situated in the cryogenic temperature, to room temperature electronics. Integrated cryogenic electronics together with semiconductor spin qubits is one way closer for scalability. Such a scalable quantum computer can have qubits and the control electronics at 4K stage. Being at 4K, more thermal dissipation is allowed without overloading the cooling capability of the fridge. Still, control and power circuitry is expected to be highly efficient. While commercial CMOS technologies are found to be operatable at \\qty{}{mK}, lack of reliable cryogenic models while designing, increased mismatches at cryo temperatures makes the design challenging and risky. Using an FDSOI technology with backgate biasing to compensate for the threshold voltage drift happening at cryo~(compensating around 200mV) and digital circuitry is a way to address this challenge. In this work, a self-clocked digital low dropout regulator (DLDO) is designed in FDSOI for high power efficient, variation tolerant regulator to supply cryogenic circuits for Quantum computing. The proposed digital LDO is more resilient to mismatch and having self clocking and close and fine loops addresses the power efficiency and faster transient response.",

    "summary": "The effects of personnel scheduling on the quality of care and working conditions for healthcare personnel have been thoroughly documented. However, the ever-present demand and large variation of constraints make healthcare scheduling particularly challenging. This problem has been studied for decades, with limited research aimed at applying Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). SMT has gained momentum within the formal verification community in the last decades, leading to the advancement of SMT solvers that have been shown to outperform standard mathematical programming techniques.\nIn this work, we propose generic constraint formulations that can model a wide range of real-world scheduling constraints. Then, the generic constraints are formulated as SMT and MILP problems and used to compare the respective state-of-the-art solvers, Z3 and Gurobi, on academic and real-world inspired rostering problems. Experimental results show how each solver excels for certain types of problems; the MILP solver generally performs better when the problem is highly constrained or infeasible, while the SMT solver performs better otherwise. On real-world inspired problems containing a more varied set of shifts and personnel, the SMT solver excels. Additionally, it was noted during experimentation that the SMT solver was more sensitive to the way the generic constraints were formulated, requiring careful consideration and experimentation to achieve better performance. We conclude that SMT-based methods present a promising avenue for future research within the domain of personnel scheduling.",

We evaluate the system through simulations using a pair of open-fitting hearables with spatially localized speech and noise sources in an anechoic environment. Performance is evaluated in terms of speech distortion, noise reduction, and signal-to-noise ratio improvement across different delays and degrees of acausality.

Existing path planning methods for auxiliary cameras track two-dimensional surgical features but do not simultaneously account for camera orientation, workspace constraints, and robot joint limits. This study presents AutoCam: an automatic auxiliary camera placement method to improve visualization in RAMIS. Implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, the system uses a priority-based, workspace-constrained control algorithm that combines heuristic geometric placement with nonlinear optimization to ensure robust camera tracking. A user study (N=6) demonstrated that the system maintained 99.84% visibility of a salient feature and achieved a pose error of 4.36 $\\pm$ 2.11 degrees and 1.95 $\\pm$ 5.66 mm. The controller was computationally efficient, with a loop time of 6.8 $\\pm$ 12.8 ms. An additional pilot study (N=6), where novices completed a Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery training task, suggests that users can teleoperate just as effectively from AutoCam's viewpoint as from the endoscope's while still benefiting from AutoCam's improved visual coverage of the scene. These results indicate that an auxiliary camera can be autonomously controlled using the da Vinci patient-side manipulators to track a salient feature, laying the groundwork for new multi-camera visualization methods in RAMIS.",

    "summary": "Gas turbine engines represent complex highly nonlinear dynamical systems. Deriving their physics-based models can be challenging as it requires performance characteristics, that are not always available, and one often has to make many simplifying assumptions. In this paper, the limitations of conventional experimental methods used to derive component-level and locally linear parameter-varying models are discussed and addressed by employing identification techniques based on data collected from standard engine operation under closed-loop control. The rotor dynamics were estimated using the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. Subsequently, the autonomous part of the dynamics was mapped into an optimally constructed Koopman eigenfunction space. The process included eigenvalue optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and temporal projection, followed by gradient-based eigenfunction identification. The resulting Koopman model was validated against an in-house reference component-level model. A globally optimal nonlinear feedback controller and a Kalman estimator were then designed in the eigenfunction space and compared to the classical and gain-scheduled proportional-integral controllers, as well as a proposed internal model control approach. The eigenmode structure allowed targeting individual modes during the optimization process, resulting in a better performance tuning. The results showed that the Koopman-based controller outperformed the other benchmark controllers in both reference tracking and disturbance rejection, under sea-level and varying flight conditions, due to its global nature.",

    "summary": "Power system operators and electric utility companies often impose a coincident peak demand charge on customers when the aggregate system demand reaches its maximum. This charge incentivizes customers to strategically shift their peak usage away from the system's collective peak, which helps reduce stress on electricity infrastructure. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretic model to analyze how such strategic behavior affects overall system efficiency. We show that depending on the extent of customers' demand-shifting capabilities, the resulting coincident peak shaving game can exhibit concavity, quasi-concavity with discontinuities, or non-concavity with discontinuities. In a two-agent, two-period setting, we derive closed-form Nash equilibrium solutions for each scenario and generalize our findings to multi-agent contexts. We prove the stability of the equilibrium points and propose an algorithm for computing equilibrium outcomes under all game configurations. Our results indicate that the peak-shaving outcome at the equilibrium of the game model is comparable to the optimal outcome of the natural centralized model. However, there is a significant loss in efficiency. Under quasi-concave and non-concave conditions, this inefficiency grows with increased customer flexibility and larger disparities in marginal shifting costs; we also examine how the number of agents influences system performance. Finally, numerical simulations with real-world applications validate our theoretical insights.",

The method effectively addresses network-induced delays, jitter, and packet loss, ensuring reliable performance in remote robotic surgery. The study evaluates the Informer model on the JIGSAWS dataset, demonstrating its capability to handle sequential data challenges caused by network uncertainties. Key features, including ProbSparse attention and a generative-style decoder, enhance prediction accuracy, computational speed, and memory efficiency. Results indicate that the proposed method achieves over 90 percent accuracy across varying network conditions.

    "summary": "Finding Lyapunov functions to certify the stability of control systems has been an important topic for verifying safety-critical systems. Most existing methods on finding Lyapunov functions require access to the dynamics of the system. Accurately describing the complete dynamics of a control system however remains highly challenging in practice. Latest trend of using learning-enabled control systems further reduces the transparency. Hence, a method for black-box systems would have much wider applications.\nOur work stems from the recent idea of sampling and exploiting Lipschitz continuity to approximate the unknown dynamics. Given Lipschitz constants, one can derive a non-statistical upper bounds on approximation errors; hence a strong certification on this approximation can certify the unknown dynamics. We significantly improve this idea by directly approximating the Lie derivative of Lyapunov functions instead of the dynamics. We propose a framework based on the learner-verifier architecture from Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS). Our insight of combining regional verification conditions and counterexample-guided sampling enables a guided search for samples to prove stability region-by-region. Our CEGIS algorithm further ensures termination.\nOur numerical experiments suggest that it is possible to prove the stability of 2D and 3D systems with a few thousands of samples. Our visualization also reveals the regions where the stability is difficult to prove. In comparison with the existing black-box approach, our approach at the best case requires less than 0.01% of samples.",

    "summary": "Neural operators have demonstrated promise in modeling and controlling systems governed by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Beyond PDEs, Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) play a critical role in modeling systems influenced by randomness, with applications in finance, physics, and beyond. However, controlling SPDE-governed systems remains a significant challenge. On the one hand, the regularity of the system's state (which can be intuitively understood as smoothness) deteriorates, making modeling and generalization more challenging. On the other hand, this stochasticity also renders control more unstable and thus less accurate. To address this gap, we propose the Model-Based Closed-Loop Control Algorithm (MB-CC), the first model-based closed-loop control method for SPDEs. MB-CC introduces two key innovations to enhance control robustness and efficiency: a Regularity Feature (RF) block and a closed-loop strategy with an operator-encoded policy network. The RF block, inspired by the regularity structure theory of SPDEs, addresses noise-induced irregularities by transforming the network's input, including the system state and noise-perturbed external forces, into a refined feature space for improved forward prediction. Compared to previous works using regularity features, we introduce a new parameterization, data augmentation, and extend the RF block as a plug-and-play component. Additionally, to achieve closed-loop control, we introduce an operator-encoded policy network to map the current state to optimal control, which integrates physical priors and swiftly makes decisions based on states returned by the environment. We conduct a systematic evaluation of MB-CC on two notable SPDEs, showcasing its effectiveness and efficiency. The ablation studies show its ability to handle stochasticity more effectively.",

    "summary": "This paper considers the problem of finding an optimal order for entanglement swapping in a heterogeneous path of quantum repeaters so as to maximize the path throughput defined as the delivery rate of end-to-end entanglements. The primary difficulty in addressing this problem lies in the vast array of possible swapping orders for large paths and the complexity of the expected throughput, which depends on the attributes of each node and edge along the path, as well as the order of swapping. To cope with these issues, we first propose simple approximations in estimating the swapping outcome between two entanglement distributions that can run in constant time, thereby providing an efficient approach for evaluating and comparing different swapping orders, allowing us to solve the problem exactly for small paths. Second, as the number of possible orders grows exponentially with the number of repeaters in the path, we develop an efficient heuristic based on the greedy selection of nodes to sequentially perform swaps according to their swapping scores, defined as the expected number of entanglements resulting from their swaps. The scores are local but dynamic in the sense that they depend not just on the entanglement distributions available on the path but also on prior swapping decisions. Finally, we illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model and approach through extensive experimentation conducted using a general quantum network simulator.",

    "summary": "Fulton's matrix Schubert varieties are affine varieties that arise in the study of Schubert calculus in the complete flag variety. Weigandt showed that arbitrary intersections of matrix Schubert varieties, now called ASM varieties, are indexed by alternating sign matrices (ASMs), objects with a long history in enumerative combinatorics. It is very difficult to assess Cohen-Macaulayness of ASM varieties or to compute their codimension, though these properties are well understood for matrix Schubert varieties due to work of Fulton. In this paper we study these properties of ASM varieties with a focus on the relationship between a pair of ASMs and their direct sum. We also consider ASM pattern avoidance from an algebro-geometric perspective.",

    "summary": "We study the problem of signal recovery in the dihedral multi-reference alignment (MRA) model, where a signal is observed under random actions of the dihedral group and corrupted by additive noise. While previous has shown that cyclic invariants of degree three (the bispectrum) suffice to recover generic signals up to circular shift, the dihedral setting introduces new challenges due to the groups non-abelian structure. In particular reflections prevent the diagonalization of the third moment tensor in the Fourier basis, making classical bispectrum techniques inapplicable.\nIn this work we prove that the orbit of the generic signal in the $n$-dimensional standard representation of the then $2n$-element dihedral group $D_{n}$ is uniquely determined by invariant tensors of degree at most three. This resolves an open question in the literature and establishes that the sample complexity for dihedral MRA with uniform distribution is $\\omega(\\sigma^6)$ matching the cyclic case. While frequency marching becomes computationally impractical in the dihedral setting, we show numerically that a simple optimization algorithm reliably recovers the signal from third order moments, even with random initialization.",

A prominent role in this link has been played by large N dualities and holography.

We explain how this leads to the computation of topological string amplitudes in terms of topological vertex for toric Calabi-Yau threefolds. Furthermore, applications of topological strings to a conceptual derivation of Skein relations for link invariants as well as some of its physical applications to black hole physics are also reviewed.",

This is accomplished by combining Koshikawa's technique, the theory of geometric Eisenstein series over the Fargues-Fontaine curve, the work of Santos describing the structure of the fibers of the minimally and toroidally compactified Hodge-Tate period morphism for general PEL type Shimura varieties of type $A$ or $C$, and ideas developed by Zhang on comparing Hecke correspondences on the moduli stack of $G$-bundles with the cohomology of Shimura varieties. In the process, we also establish a description of the generic part of the cohomology that bears resemblance to the work of Xiao-Zhu. Moreover, we also construct a filtration on the compactly supported cohomology that differs from Manotovan's filtration in the case that the Shimura variety is non-compact, allowing us to circumvent some of the circumlocutions taken by Cariani-Scholze. Our method showcases a very general strategy for proving such torsion vanishing results, and should bear even more fruit once the inputs are generalized. Motivated by this, we formulate an even more general torsion vanishing conjecture.",

    "summary": "Inequalities among symmetric functions are fundamental in various branches of mathematics, thus motivating a systematic study of their structure. Majorization has been shown to characterize inequalities among commonly used symmetric functions, except for complete homogeneous symmetric functions (shortened as CHs). In 2011, Cuttler, Greene, and Skandera posed a natural question: Can majorization also characterize inequalities among CHs? Their work demonstrated that majorization characterizes inequalities among CHs up to degree 7 and suggested exploring its validity for higher degrees. In this paper, we show that, for every degree greater than 7, majorization does not characterize inequalities among CHs.",

Its features are that the diffusion coefficient depends on the unknown function and the boundary condition is not monotone. Namely, our equation is regarded as the pseudo monotone type. The aim of this paper is to prove the convergence of approximate solutions constructed by the finite volume method. Also, we establish the uniqueness of solutions by the dual equation method.",

    "summary": "This paper is concerned with extending the notion of monotone solution to the mean field game (MFG) master equation to situations in which the coefficients are displacement monotone, instead of the previously introduced notion in the flat monotone regime. To account for this new setting, we work directly on the equation satisfied by the controls of the MFG. Following previous works, we define an appropriate notion of solution under which uniqueness and stability results hold for solutions without any differentiability assumption with respect to probability measures. Thanks to those properties, we show the existence of a monotone solution to displacement monotone mean field games under local regularity assumptions on the coefficients and sufficiently strong monotonicity. Albeit they are not the focus of this article, results presented are also of interest for mean field games of control and general mean field forward backward systems. In order to account for this last setting, we use the notion of $L^2$-monotonicity instead of displacement monotonicity, those two notions being equivalent in the particular case of MFG.",

The evolution of the car density is described by a continuity equation where the drivers' velocity depends on both the empty road velocity and the convolution of the car density with an anisotropic kernel. We establish existence and uniqueness results. When the convolution kernel is replaced by a Dirac Delta, the nonlocal model formally boils down to the classical (local) Generalized Aw-Rascle-Zhang model, which consists of a conservation law coupled with a transport equation. In the case of exponential kernels, we establish convergence in the nonlocal-to-local limit by proving an Oleinik-type estimate for the convolution term. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first nonlocal-to-local limit result for a system of two non-decoupling equations with a nonlocal flux function.",

This paper investigates an inverse problem of reconstructing the trajectory of the piston from the given leading shock front and the given initial flow conditions. We observe that in piston models, as the initial density goes to zero, the piston approaches the shock front; however, in the region between the piston and the shock front, the strict hyperbolicity of the system degenerates. By applying asymptotic analysis, we provide quantitative characterizations of the distance between the piston and the shock front, and the degeneration of strict hyperbolicity. Consequently, by designing appropriate a priori assumptions to balance the benefits and drawbacks arising as the initial density approaches zero, we employ the method of characteristics to prove the global-in-time existence of the piecewise smooth solution for this inverse problem. In particular, the resulting flow structure exhibits significant velocity variations.",

    "summary": "This paper focuses on the well-posedness (or lack thereof) of three-dimensional time-harmonic wave propagation problems modeled by the Helmholtz equation. It is well-known that if the problem is set in bounded domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions, then the Helmholtz problem is well-posed for all (real-valued) frequencies except for a sequence of countably many resonant frequencies that accumulate at infinity. In fact, if the domain is sufficiently smooth, this can be quantified further and Weyl's law states that the number of resonant frequencies less than a given $\\omega > 0$ scales as $\\omega^3$. On the other hand, scattering problems set in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with a radiation condition at infinity and a bounded obstacle modeled by variations in the PDE coefficients are well-posed for all frequencies under mild regularity assumption on such coefficients. In 2001, Filinov provided a counter example of a rough coefficient such that the scattering problem is not well-posed for (at least) a single frequency $\\omega$. In this contribution, we use this result to show that for all $\\varepsilon > 0$ we can design a rough coefficient corresponding to a compactly supported obstacle such that the scattering problem is ill-posed for a countable sequence of frequencies accumulating at infinity, and such that the number of such frequencies less than any given $\\omega > 0$ scales as $\\omega^{3-\\varepsilon}$.",

    "summary": "In the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model for single-lane traffic, vehicle trajectories follow the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle and can be represented by a monotone three-dimensional surface of cumulative vehicle count. In contrast, the generalized bathtub model, which describes congestion dynamics in transportation networks using relative space, typically violates the FIFO principle, making its representation more challenging.\nBuilding on the characteristic distance ordering concept, we observe that trips in the generalized bathtub model can be ordered by their characteristic distances (remaining trip distance plus network travel distance). We define a new cumulative number of trips ahead of a trip with a given remaining distance at a time instant, showing it forms a monotone three-dimensional surface despite FIFO violations. Using the inverse function theorem, we derive equivalent formulations with different coordinates and dependent variables, including special cases for Vickrey's bathtub model and the basic bathtub model.\nWe demonstrate numerical methods based on these formulations and discuss trip-based approaches for discrete demand patterns. This study enhances understanding of the generalized bathtub model's properties, facilitating its application in network traffic flow modeling, congestion pricing, and transportation planning.",

    "summary": "Existence and uniqueness of global in time measure solution for the multidimensional aggregation equation is analyzed. Such a system can be written as a continuity equation with a velocity field computed through a self-consistent interaction potential. In Carrillo et al. (Duke Math J (2011)), a well-posedness theory based on the geometric approach of gradient flows in measure metric spaces has been developed for mildly singular potentials at the origin under the basic assumption of being lambda-convex. We propose here an alternative method using classical tools from PDEs. We show the existence of a characteristic flow based on Filippov's theory of discontinuous dynamical systems such that the weak measure solution is the pushforward measure with this flow. Uniqueness is obtained thanks to a contraction argument in transport distances using the lambda-convexity of the potential. Moreover, we show the equivalence of this solution with the gradient flow solution. Finally, we show the convergence of a numerical scheme for general measure solutions in this framework allowing for the simulation of solutions for initial smooth densities after their first blow-up time in Lp-norms.",

    "summary": "We consider solitary water waves on a rotational, unidirectional flow in a two-dimensional channel of finite depth. Ovsyannikov has conjectured in 1983 that the solitary wave is uniquely determined by the Bernoulli constant, mass flux and by the flow force. This conjecture was disproved by Plotnikov in 1992 for the ir-rotational flow. In this paper we show that this conjecture is wrong also for rotational flows. Moreover we prove that in any neighborhood of the first bifurcation point on the branch of solitary waves, approaching the extreme wave, there are infinitely many pairs of solitary waves corresponding to the same Bernoulli constant. We give a description of the structure of this set of pairs. The proof is based on a bifurcation analysis of the global branch of solitary waves which is of independent interest.",

The weak solution exhibits well-controlled energy dissipation, occurring only during contact on a set of zero measure and exclusively when the string moves downward.

    "summary": "This paper investigates the existence and qualitative properties of minimizers for a class of nonlocal micromagnetic energy functionals defined on bounded domains. The considered energy functional consists of a symmetric exchange interaction, which penalizes spatial variations in magnetization, and a magnetostatic self-energy term that accounts for long-range dipolar interactions. Motivated by the extension of Brown's fundamental theorem on fine ferromagnetic particles to nonlocal settings, we develop a rigorous variational framework in $L^2(\\Omega;\\mathbb{S}^2)$ under mild assumptions on the interaction kernel $j$, including symmetry, L√©vy-type integrability, and prescribed singular behavior. For spherical domains, we generalize Browns fundamental results by identifying critical radii $R^*$ and $R^{**}$ that delineate distinct energetic regimes: for $ R \\leq R^*$, the uniform magnetization state is energetically preferable (small-body regime), whereas for $R \\geq R^{**}$, non-uniform magnetization configurations become dominant (large-body regime). These transitions are analyzed through Poincar√©-type inequalities and explicit energy comparisons between uniform and vortex-like magnetization states.\nOur results directly connect classical micromagnetic theory and contemporary nonlocal models, providing new insights into domain structure formation in nanoscale magnetism. Furthermore, the mathematical framework developed in this work contributes to advancing theoretical foundations for applications in spintronics and data storage technologies.",

Second, in relation to integer exponents, while [4] showed that Stein-Weiss fails for $L^1(|x| dx)$ data, we prove a weaker Korn type Hardy-Sobolev inequality.

In the case of the compressible Euler system, we describe the structure of the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of vector fields associated with waves. We prove that a certain class of Lie modules associated with a hydrodynamic-type systems can be uniquely transformed into a real Lie algebra in an angle-preserving manner. For the Euler system, we then demonstrate the connection between the transformed finite-dimensional Lie algebra and the infinite-dimensional algebra associated with waves. This enables a detailed investigation of the geometry of wave superpositions using tools from differential geometry and Lie group theory. In particular, we study the geometry of the manifold of wave superpositions in terms of deformations of submanifolds corresponding to Lie subalgebras associated with waves.

    "summary": "Viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation were introduced by Lions and Crandall. For Tonelli Hamiltonians, these solutions are generated by the Lax-Oleinik operator. It is known that this operator converges in the autonomous framework, but this convergence fails in the general cases. In this paper, we introduce a method to construct smooth, recurrent, non-periodic viscosity solutions on fixed compact manifolds $M$ of dimension 2 or higher. Additionally, we provide a detailed description of the non-wandering set of the Lax-Oleinik operator and identify its action on various omega-limit sets.",

    "summary": "Persistent homology is a fundamental tool in topological data analysis; however, it lacks methods to quantify the fragility or fineness of cycles, anticipate their formation or disappearance, or evaluate their stability beyond persistence. Furthermore, classical Betti numbers fail to capture key structural properties such as simplicial dimensions and higher-order adjacencies. In this work, we investigate the robustness of simplicial networks by analyzing cycle thickness and their resilience to failures or attacks. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from persistent homology to introduce filtrations that model distinct simplicial elimination rules, leading to the definition of two novel Betti number families: thick and cohesive Betti numbers. These improved invariants capture richer structural information, enabling the measurement of the thickness of the links in the homology cycle and the assessment of the strength of their connections. This enhances and refines classical topological descriptors and our approach provides deeper insights into the structural dynamics of simplicial complexes and establishes a theoretical framework for assessing robustness in higher-order networks. Finally, we establish that the resilience of topological features to simplicial attacks can be systematically examined through biparameter persistence modules, wherein one parameter encodes the progression of the attack, and the other captures structural refinements informed by thickness or cohesiveness.",

Recovering the times of recurrence from such a multi-variate time series is of a fundamental importance for many monitoring and control tasks. For a periodic time series this is equivalent to determining its period length. In this work we present a persistent homology framework to estimate recurrence times in multi-variate time series with different generalizations of cyclic behavior (periodic, repetitive, and recurring). To this end, we provide three specialized methods within our framework that are provably stable and validate them using real-world data, including a new benchmark dataset from an injection molding machine.",

    "summary": "Given a pair of time series, we study how the periodicity of one influences the periodicity of the other. There are several known methods to measure the similarity between a pair of time series, such as cross-correlation, coherence, cross-recurrence, and dynamic time warping. But we have yet to find any measures with theoretical stability results.\nPersistence homology has been utilized to construct a scoring function with theoretical guarantees of stability that quantifies the periodicity of a single univariate time series f1, denoted score(f1). Building on this concept, we propose a conditional periodicity score that quantifies the periodicity of one univariate time series f1 given another f2, denoted score(f1|f2), and derive theoretical stability results for the same. With the use of dimension reduction in mind, we prove a new stability result for score(f1|f2) under principal component analysis (PCA) when we use the projections of the time series embeddings onto their respective first K principal components. We show that the change in our score is bounded by a function of the eigenvalues corresponding to the remaining (unused) N-K principal components and hence is small when the first K principal components capture most of the variation in the time series embeddings. Finally we derive a lower bound on the minimum embedding dimension to use in our pipeline which guarantees that any two such embeddings give scores that are within a given epsilon of each other.\nWe present a procedure for computing conditional periodicity scores and implement it on several pairs of synthetic signals. We experimentally compare our similarity measure to the most-similar statistical measure of cross-recurrence, and show the increased accuracy and stability of our score when predicting and measuring whether or not the periodicities of two time series are similar.",

This work focuses on the existence problem for such codes in the n-dimensional infinite grid. We demonstrate that several parameter families of such codes necessarily arise from binary or ternary Hamming graphs or do not exist. Furthermore, employing binary linear programming techniques, we explore completely regular codes in infinite grids of dimensions 3 and 4 for the cases r=1 and r=2.",

In this paper, we present an explicit formula for the eigenvalues of $\\text{Cay}(R, R^{\\times})$ for any finite ring $R$. However, our focus is on a more general case of the unitary Cayley graph. It is well known that the classical Ramanujan's sum represents the eigenvalues of $\\text{Cay}(\\mathbb{Z}_n, \\mathbb{Z}_n^{\\times})$. Consequently, the eigenvalues of $\\text{Cay}(R, R^{\\times})$ can be view as a generalization of classical Ramanujan's sum in the context of finite rings.

    "summary": "A well-known result of Stanley's shows that given a graph $G$ with chromatic symmetric function expanded into the basis of elementary symmetric functions as $X_G = \\sum c_{\\lambda}e_{\\lambda}$, the sum of the coefficients $c_{\\lambda}$ for $\\lambda$ with $\\lambda_1' = k$ (equivalently those $\\lambda$ with exactly $k$ parts) is equal to the number of acyclic orientations of $G$ with exactly $k$ sinks.\nHowever, more is known. The sink sequence of an acyclic orientation of $G$ is a tuple $(s_1,\\dots,s_k)$ such that $s_1$ is the number of sinks of the orientation, and recursively each $s_i$ with $i > 1$ is the number of sinks remaining after deleting the sinks contributing to $s_1,\\dots,s_{i-1}$. Equivalently, the sink sequence gives the number of vertices at each level of the poset induced by the acyclic orientation.\nA lesser-known follow-up result of Stanley's determines certain cases in which we can find a sum of $e$-basis coefficients that gives the number of acyclic orientations of $G$ with a given partial sink sequence. Of interest in its own right, this result also admits as a corollary a simple proof of the $e$-positivity of $X_G$ when the stability number of $G$ is $2$.\nIn this paper, we prove a vertex-weighted generalization of this follow-up result, and conjecture a stronger version that admits a similar combinatorial interpretation for a much larger set of $e$-coefficient sums of chromatic symmetric functions. In particular, the conjectured formula would give a combinatorial interpretation for the sum of the coefficients $c_{\\lambda}$ with prescribed values of $\\lambda_1'$ and $\\lambda_2'$ for any unweighted claw-free graph (not necessarily an incomparability graph, as in the setting of the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture).",

    "summary": "Phylogenetic networks are a special type of graph which generalize phylogenetic trees and that are used to model non-treelike evolutionary processes such as recombination and hybridization. In this paper, we consider {\\em unrooted} phylogenetic networks, i.e. simple, connected graphs $\\mathcal{N}=(V,E)$ with leaf set $X$, for $X$ some set of species, in which every internal vertex in $\\mathcal{N}$ has degree three. One approach used to construct such phylogenetic networks is to take as input a collection $\\mathcal{P}$ of phylogenetic trees and to look for a network $\\mathcal{N}$ that contains each tree in $\\mathcal{P}$ and that minimizes the quantity $r(\\mathcal{N}) = |E|-(|V|-1)$ over all such networks. Such a network always exists, and the quantity $r(\\mathcal{N})$ for an optimal network $\\mathcal{N}$ is called the hybrid number of $\\mathcal{P}$. In this paper, we give a new characterization for the hybrid number in case $\\mathcal{P}$ consists of two trees. This characterization is given in terms of a cherry picking sequence for the two trees, although to prove that our characterization holds we need to define the sequence more generally for two forests. Cherry picking sequences have been intensively studied for collections of rooted phylogenetic trees, but our new sequences are the first variant of this concept that can be applied in the unrooted setting. Since the hybrid number of two trees is equal to the well-known tree bisection and reconnection distance between the two trees, our new characterization also provides an alternative way to understand this important tree distance.",

    "summary": "The Tutte polynomial and Derksen's $\\mathcal{G}$-invariant are the universal deletion-contraction and valuative matroid and polymatroid invariants, respectively. There are only a handful of well known invariants (like the matroid Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials) between (in terms of fineness) the Tutte polynomial and Derksen's $\\mathcal{G}$-invariant. The aim of this study is to define a spectrum of generalized Tutte polynomials to fill the gap between the Tutte polynomial and Derksen's $\\mathcal{G}$-invariant. These polynomials are built by taking repeated convolution products of universal Tutte characters studied by Dupont, Fink, and Moci and using the framework of Ardila and Sanchez for studying valuative invariants. We develop foundational aspects of these polynomials by showing they are valuative on generalized permutahedra and present a generalized deletion-contraction formula. We apply these results on chain Tutte polynomials to obtain formulas for the M√∂bius polynomial, the opposite characteristic polynomial, a generalized M√∂bius polynomial, Ford's expected codimension of a matroid variety, and Derksen's $\\mathcal{G}$-invariant.",

    "summary": "An $r$-uniform hypergraph ($r$-graph for short) is linear if any two edges intersect at most one vertex. Let $\\mathcal{F}$ be a given family of $r$-graphs. An $r$-graph $H$ is called $\\mathcal{F}$-free if $H$ does not contain any member of $\\mathcal{F}$ as a subgraph. The Tur√°n number of $\\mathcal{F}$ is the maximum number of edges in any $\\mathcal{F}$-free $r$-graph on $n$ vertices, and the linear Tur√°n number of $\\mathcal{F}$ is defined as the Tur√°n number of $\\mathcal{F}$ in linear host hypergraphs. An $r$-uniform linear path $P^r_\\ell$ of length $\\ell$ is an $r$-graph with edges $e_1,\\dots,e_\\ell$ such that $|V(e_i)\\cap V(e_j)|=1$ if $|i-j|=1$, and $V(e_i)\\cap V(e_j)=\\emptyset$ for $i\\neq j$ otherwise.

    "summary": "Community detection in graphs is a problem that is likely to be relevant whenever network data appears, and consequently the problem has received much attention with many different methods and algorithms applied. However, many of these methods are hard to study theoretically, and they optimise for somewhat different goals. A general and rigorous account of the problem and possible methods remains elusive.\nWe study the problem of finding overlapping clusterings of hypergraphs, continuing the line of research started by Carlsson and M√©moli (2013) of classifying clustering schemes as functors. We extend their notion of representability to the overlapping case, showing that any representable overlapping clustering scheme is excisive and functorial, and any excisive and functorial clustering scheme is isomorphic to a representable clustering scheme.\nWe also note that, for simple graphs, any representable clustering scheme is computable in polynomial time on graphs of bounded expansion, with an exponent determined by the maximum independence number of a graph in the representing set. This result also applies to non-overlapping representable clustering schemes, and so may be of independent interest.",

However, this result is notoriously evasive in terms of efficient constructions, and it is still unknown whether such a partition can be computed in polynomial time, even for $k = 5$.\nWe make progress towards an efficient constructive version of the Gy≈ëri--Lov√°sz theorem by considering a natural strengthening of the $k$-connectivity requirement. Specifically, we show that the desired connected partition can be found in polynomial time, if $G$ contains $k$ disjoint connected dominating sets. As a consequence of this result, we give several efficient approximate and exact constructive versions of the original Gy≈ëri--Lov√°sz theorem:\n1. On general graphs, a Gy≈ëri--Lov√°sz partition with $k$ parts can be computed in polynomial time when the input graph has connectivity $\\Omega(k \\cdot \\log^2 n)$;\n2. On convex bipartite graphs, connectivity of $4k$ is sufficient;\n3. On biconvex graphs and interval graphs, connectivity of $k$ is sufficient, meaning that our algorithm gives a ``true'' constructive version of the theorem on these graph classes.",

We call such an expansion odd if its vertices can be two-colored so that the edges of the trees are bichromatic but the edges between trees are monochromatic. A graph contains an odd $K_t$ minor or an odd clique minor of order $t$ if it contains an odd $K_t$-expansion. Gerards and Seymour from 1995 conjectured that every graph $G$ contains an odd $K_{\\chi(G)}$ minor, where $\\chi(G)$ denotes the chromatic number of $G$. This conjecture is referred to as ``Odd Hadwiger's Conjecture\". Let $\\alpha(G)$ denote the independence number of a graph $G$. In this paper we investigate the Odd Hadwiger's Conjecture for graphs $G$ with $\\alpha(G)\\le2$. We first observe that a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\\alpha(G)\\le2$ contains an odd $K_{\\chi(G)}$ minor if and only if $G$ contains an odd clique minor of order $\\lceil n/2\\rceil$. We then prove that every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\\alpha(G)\\le 2$ contains an odd clique minor of order $\\lceil n/2\\rceil$ if $G$ contains a clique of order $n/4$ when $n$ is even and $(n+3)/4$ when $n$ is odd, or $G$ does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph, where $\\alpha(H)\\le 2$ and $H$ is an induced subgraph of $K_1 + P_4$, $K_2+(K_1\\cup K_3)$, $K_1+(K_1\\cup K_4)$, $K_7^-$, $K_7$, or the kite graph.",

    "summary": "Inequalities among symmetric functions are fundamental in various branches of mathematics, thus motivating a systematic study of their structure. Majorization has been shown to characterize inequalities among commonly used symmetric functions, except for complete homogeneous symmetric functions (shortened as CHs). In 2011, Cuttler, Greene, and Skandera posed a natural question: Can majorization also characterize inequalities among CHs? Their work demonstrated that majorization characterizes inequalities among CHs up to degree 7 and suggested exploring its validity for higher degrees. In this paper, we show that, for every degree greater than 7, majorization does not characterize inequalities among CHs.",

    "summary": "Many first-order equational theories, such as the theory of groups or boolean algebras, can be presented by a smaller set of axioms than the original one. Recent studies showed that a homological approach to equational theories gives us inequalities to obtain lower bounds on the number of axioms. In this paper, we extend this result to higher-order equational theories. More precisely, we consider simply typed lambda calculus with product and unit types and study sets of equations between lambda terms. Then, we define homology groups of the given equational theory and show that a lower bound on the number of equations can be computed from the homology groups.",

    "summary": "We develop fibrational perspectives on context-free grammars and on nondeterministic finite-state automata over categories and operads. A generalized CFG is a functor from a free colored operad (aka multicategory) generated by a pointed finite species into an arbitrary base operad: this encompasses classical CFGs by taking the base to be a certain operad constructed from a free monoid, as an instance of a more general construction of an \\emph{operad of spliced arrows} $\\mathcal{W}\\,\\mathcal{C}$ for any category $\\mathcal{C}$. A generalized NFA is a functor from an arbitrary bipointed category or pointed operad satisfying the unique lifting of factorizations and finite fiber properties: this encompasses classical word automata and tree automata without $\\epsilon$-transitions, but also automata over non-free categories and operads. We show that generalized context-free and regular languages satisfy suitable generalizations of many of the usual closure properties, and in particular we give a simple conceptual proof that context-free languages are closed under intersection with regular languages. Finally, we observe that the splicing functor $\\mathcal{W} : Cat \\to Oper$ admits a left adjoint $\\mathcal{C}: Oper \\to Cat$, which we call the \\emph{contour category} construction since the arrows of $\\mathcal{C}\\,\\mathcal{O}$ have a geometric interpretation as oriented contours of operations of $\\mathcal{O}$. A direct consequence of the contour / splicing adjunction is that every pointed finite species induces a universal CFG generating a language of \\emph{tree contour words.} This leads us to a generalization of the Chomsky-Sch√ºtzenberger Representation Theorem, establishing that a subset of a homset $L \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}(A,B)$ is a CFL of arrows if and only if it is a functorial image of the intersection of a $\\mathcal{C}$-chromatic tree contour language with a regular language.",

However, many of these methods are hard to study theoretically, and they optimise for somewhat different goals. A general and rigorous account of the problem and possible methods remains elusive.\nWe study the problem of finding overlapping clusterings of hypergraphs, continuing the line of research started by Carlsson and M√©moli (2013) of classifying clustering schemes as functors. We extend their notion of representability to the overlapping case, showing that any representable overlapping clustering scheme is excisive and functorial, and any excisive and functorial clustering scheme is isomorphic to a representable clustering scheme.\nWe also note that, for simple graphs, any representable clustering scheme is computable in polynomial time on graphs of bounded expansion, with an exponent determined by the maximum independence number of a graph in the representing set. This result also applies to non-overlapping representable clustering schemes, and so may be of independent interest.",

We provide a detailed construction of the categorical generalization of BF theory, dubbed BFCG, also known as 2BF. Similar to BF gravity, it is known that BFCG can be deformed to give general relativity. Here, we obtain an alternative relation between BFCG and gravity, which consists of coupling general relativity and BFCG by means of the volume form constructed out of the BFCG connections. The resulting theory, closely related to unimodular gravity, is a generalization of BF sequestered gravity not only in the sense that it adds new fields but also in that it allows for new choices for the volume form that is coupled to gravity. Furthermore, we show that BF sequestered gravity in the abelian case is recovered for a specific choice of the 2-group.",

In both regimes, we derive precise large-$N$ expansions of the free energy up to the $O(1)$ term, providing a non-radially symmetric example that confirms the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture made for general planar Coulomb gas ensembles. As a consequence, our results provide asymptotic behaviours of moments of the characteristic polynomial of the complex Ginibre matrix, where the powers are of order $O(N)$. Furthermore, by combining with a duality formula, we obtain precise large deviation probabilities of the smallest eigenvalue of the Laguerre unitary ensemble.

    "summary": "We investigate the validity of the synthetic Ricci curvature lower bound known as the measure contraction property (MCP) for sub-Riemannian structures beyond step two. We show that whenever the distance function is not Lipschitz in charts, the MCP may fail. This occurs already in fundamental examples such as the Martinet and Engel structures.\nCentral to our analysis are new results on the stability of the local MCP under quotients by isometric group actions for general metric measure spaces, developed under a weaker variant of the essential non-branching condition which, in contrast with the classical one, is implied by the minimizing Sard property in sub-Riemannian geometry.\nSince the MCP is preserved under blow-ups, we focus on Carnot homogeneous spaces, proving that MCP descends to suitable quotients. As a byproduct, any structure whose tangent at some point admits a quotient to Martinet fails the MCP. We also obtain a computation-free proof that the Grushin plane shares the Heisenberg group's MCP. Applications include a detailed analysis of validity and failure of the MCP for Carnot groups of low dimension.\nOur results suggest a conjecture on the failure of the MCP in presence of Goh abnormal geodesics satisfying the strong generalized Legendre condition.",

Previously, examples with this feature were produced by Boyer and van Coevering for Brieskorn-Pham polynomials or their deformations. Our examples are based on the more general framework of invertible polynomials. In particular, we construct families of links that preserve the emptiness of the extremal Sasaki-Reeb cone via the Berglund-H√ºbsch rule: if the link does not admit extremal Sasaki metrics then its Berglund-H√ºbsch dual preserves this property and moreover this dual admits a representative in its local moduli with a larger Sasaki-Reeb cone which remains obstructed to admitting extremal Sasaki metrics. Some of the examples exhibited here have the homotopy type of a sphere or are rational homology spheres.",

Our study extends classical results on parallel and focal surfaces of surfaces of revolution to the helicoidal setting. In particular, we show that both parallel and focal surfaces of a helicoidal surface are helicoidal, with their generating curves arising from one-parameter deformations of the corresponding parallel and evolute curves.

We provide a detailed construction of the categorical generalization of BF theory, dubbed BFCG, also known as 2BF. Similar to BF gravity, it is known that BFCG can be deformed to give general relativity. Here, we obtain an alternative relation between BFCG and gravity, which consists of coupling general relativity and BFCG by means of the volume form constructed out of the BFCG connections. The resulting theory, closely related to unimodular gravity, is a generalization of BF sequestered gravity not only in the sense that it adds new fields but also in that it allows for new choices for the volume form that is coupled to gravity. Furthermore, we show that BF sequestered gravity in the abelian case is recovered for a specific choice of the 2-group.",

    "summary": "I introduce a novel mathematical framework integrating topological dynamics, operator algebras, and ergodic geometry to study lattices of asynchronous metric dynamical systems. Each node in the lattice carries an internal flow represented by a one-parameter family of operators, evolving on its own time scale. I formalize stratified state spaces capturing multiple levels of synchronized behavior, define an asynchronous evolution metric that quantifies phase-offset distances between subsystems, and characterize emergent coherent topologies arising when subsystems synchronize. Within this framework, I develop formal operators for the evolution of each subsystem and give precise conditions under which phase-aligned synchronization occurs across the lattice. The main results include: (1) the existence and uniqueness of coherent (synchronized) states under a contractive coupling condition, (2) stability of these coherent states and criteria for their emergence as a collective phase transition in a continuous operator topology, and (3) the influence of symmetries, with group-invariant coupling leading to flow-invariant synchrony subspaces and structured cluster dynamics. Proofs are given for each theorem, demonstrating full mathematical rigor. In a final section, I discuss hypothetical applications of this framework to symbolic lattice systems (e.g. subshifts), to invariant group actions on dynamical lattices, and to operator fields over stratified manifolds in the spirit of noncommutative geometry. Throughout, I write in the first person to emphasize the exploratory nature of this work. The paper avoids any reference to cosmology or observers, focusing instead on clean, formal mathematics suitable for a broad array of dynamical systems.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we study Borel probability measures of maximal entropy for analytic subsets in a dynamical system. It is well known that higher smoothness of the map over smooth space plays important role in the study of invariant measures of maximal entropy. A famous theorem of Newhouse states that smooth diffeomorphisms on compact manifolds without boundary have invariant measures of maximal entropy. However, we show that the situation becomes completely different when we study measures of maximal entropy for analytic subsets. Namely, we construct a smooth surface system which contains a smooth curve having no Borel probability measure of maximal entropy. Another evidence to show this difference is that, once an analytic set has one measure of maximal entropy, then the set has many measures of maximal entropy (no matter if we consider packing or Bowen entropy). For a general dynamical system with positive entropy $h_\\mathrm{top}(T)$, we shall show that the system contains not only a Borel subset which has Borel probability measures of maximal entropy and has entropy sufficiently close to $h_\\mathrm{top}(T)$, but also a Borel subset which has no Borel probability measures of maximal entropy and has entropy equal to the arbitrarily given positive real number which is at most $h_\\mathrm{top}(T)$. We also provide in all $h$-expansive systems a full characterization for analytic subsets which have Borel probability measures of maximal entropy. Consequently, if let $Z\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ be any analytic subset with positive Hausdorff dimension in Euclidean space, then the set $Z$ either has a measure of full lower Hausdorff dimension, or it can be partitioned into a union of countably many analytic sets $\\{Z_i\\}_{i\\in \\mathbb{N}}$ with $\\dim_{\\mathcal{H}}(Z_i) < \\dim_{\\mathcal{H}}(Z)$ for each $i$.",

The resonance zone is rigorously defined using the separatrix of unstable resonant periodic orbits surrounding stable quasi-periodic regions. Our study leverages the planar, circular, restricted three-body problem (PCR3BP) to estimate the (stable) resonance widths and (unstable) chaotic resonance zones of influence of the 2:1 and 3:1 MMRs across various Jacobi constants, employing a Poincar√© map at perigee and presenting findings in easily interpretable geocentric orbital elements. An analysis of the semi-major axis versus eccentricity plane reveals broader regions of resonance influence than those predicted by semi-analytical models based on the perturbed Kepler problem. A comparison with high-fidelity 3-dimensional ephemeris propagation of several spacecraft - TESS, IBEX, and Spektr-R - in these regions is made, which shows good agreement with the simplified CR3BP model.",

This generalizes previous work by Mackey, Zimmer, Ellis, Austin, and the second author and Tao, and is inspired by the Furstenberg-Zimmer and Host-Kra structure theories for actions of uncountable groups. Our approach translates the ergodic-theoretic question into topological dynamics, where we establish a corresponding classification: an extension in topological dynamics has relative discrete spectrum precisely when it admits a skew-product representation by bundles of compact homogeneous spaces. A key step in our argument is establishing a Peter-Weyl-type theorem for bundles of compact groups which might be of independent interest.",

The CAP tiling has pure-point dynamical spectrum, which we compute explicitly, and comes from a natural cut-and-project scheme with 2-dimensional Euclidean internal space. All other members of the Hat family, in particular the original version constructed from 30-60-90 right triangles, are obtained via small modifications of the projection from this cut-and-project scheme.",

During operation, the emergence of localization is difficult to predict, partly because of changing parameters over the life cycle of a system. This work proposes a novel, network-based approach to detect an imminent localized vibration. Synthetic measurement data is used to generate a functional network, which captures the dynamic interplay of the machine parts, complementary to their geometric coupling. Analysis of these functional networks reveals an impending localized vibration and its location. The method is demonstrated using a model system for a bladed disk, a ring composed of coupled nonlinear Duffing oscillators. Results indicate that the proposed method is robust against small parameter uncertainties, added measurement noise, and the length of the measurement data samples.

This conjecture was disproved by Plotnikov in 1992 for the ir-rotational flow. In this paper we show that this conjecture is wrong also for rotational flows. Moreover we prove that in any neighborhood of the first bifurcation point on the branch of solitary waves, approaching the extreme wave, there are infinitely many pairs of solitary waves corresponding to the same Bernoulli constant. We give a description of the structure of this set of pairs. The proof is based on a bifurcation analysis of the global branch of solitary waves which is of independent interest.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we deal with the construction of holomorphic functions on a simply connected domain satisfying that all its derivatives and antiderivatives under a composition operator have a dense orbit. Such functions will be called Luh hypercyclic vectors for the respective composition operator. We show that there is a dense linear manifold of Luh hypercyclic vectors. Moreover, we study the dynamics of cosine operator function generated by weighted composition operators on solid Banach function spaces, in particular on Orlicz and Morrey spaces, and we give sufficient conditions for supercyclicity of such cosine operator functions in terms of the corresponding weight function. Also, we give concrete examples of weighted translations satisfying these sufficient conditions.",

    "summary": "We consider the inverse problem of recovering a continuous-domain function from a finite number of noisy linear measurements. The unknown signal is modeled as the sum of a slowly varying trend and a periodic or quasi-periodic seasonal component. We formulate a variational framework for their joint recovery by introducing convex regularizations based on generalized total variation, which promote sparsity in spline-like representations. Our analysis is conducted in an infinite-dimensional setting and leads to a representer theorem showing that minimizers are splines in both components. To make the approach numerically feasible, we introduce a family of discrete approximations and prove their convergence to the original problem in the sense of $\\Gamma$-convergence. This further ensures the uniform convergence of discrete solutions to their continuous counterparts. The proposed framework offers a principled approach to seasonal-trend decomposition in the presence of noise and limited measurements, with theoretical guarantees on both representation and discretization.",

For $1<p<\\infty$ and any finite sum $T$ of finite products of Toeplitz operators $T_{\\varphi}$'s, we show that $T$ is compact on the weighted Fock space $F^p_{\\alpha,w}$ if and only if its Berezin transform vanishes at infinity, where $w$ is a restricted $A_p$-weight on $\\mathbb{C}^n$. Concerning boundedness, for $1\\leq p<\\infty$, we characterize the $r$-doubling weights $w$ such that $T_{\\varphi}$ is bounded on the weighted spaces $L^p_{\\alpha,w}$ via a $\\varphi$-adapted $A_p$-type condition. Our method also establishes a two weight inequality for the Fock projections in the case of $r$-doubling weights.

    "summary": "Given two subgroups H,K of a finite group G, the probability that a pair of random elements from H and K commutes is denoted by \\pr(H,K). We address the following question.\nLet P be a p-subgroup of a finite group G and assume that \\pr(P,P^x)\\geq\\e>0 for every x\\in G. Is the order of P modulo O_p(G) bounded in terms of e only?\nWith respect to this question, we establish several positive results but show that in general the answer is negative. In particular, we prove that if the composition factors of G which are isomorphic to simple groups of Lie type in characteristic p, have Lie rank at most n, then the order of P modulo O_p(G) is bounded in terms of n and e only. If P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G, then the order of P modulo O_p(G) is bounded in terms e only. Some other results of similar flavour are established.\nWe also show that if \\pr(P_1,P_2)>0 for every two Sylow p-subgroups P_1,P_2 of a profinite group G, then O_{p,p'}(G) is open in G.",

    "summary": "Semantic communication (SemCom) aims to convey the intended meaning of messages rather than merely transmitting bits, thereby offering greater efficiency and robustness, particularly in resource-constrained or noisy environments. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which is referred to as joint source-channel noise adding with adaptive denoising (JSCNA-AD) for SemCom based on a diffusion model (DM). Unlike conventional encoder-decoder designs, our approach intentionally incorporates the channel noise during transmission, effectively transforming the harmful channel noise into a constructive component of the diffusion-based semantic reconstruction process. Besides, we introduce an attention-based adaptive denoising mechanism, in which transmitted images are divided into multiple regions, and the number of denoising steps is dynamically allocated based on the semantic importance of each region. This design effectively balances the reception quality and the inference latency by prioritizing the critical semantic information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing SemCom schemes under various noise conditions, underscoring the potential of diffusion-based models in next-generation communication systems.",

    "summary": "To circumvent the high path loss of mmWave propagation and reduce the hardware cost of massive multiple-input multiple-output antenna systems, full-dimensional hybrid beamforming is critical in 5G and beyond wireless communications. Concerning an uplink multi-cell system with a large-scale uniform planar antenna array, this paper designs an efficient hybrid beamformer using primitive Kronecker decomposition and dynamic factor allocation, where the analog beamformer applies to null the inter-cell interference and simultaneously enhances the desired signals. In contrast, the digital beamformer mitigates the intra-cell interference using the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. Then, due to the low accuracy of phase shifters inherent in the analog beamformer, a low-complexity hybrid beamformer is developed to slow its adjustment speed. Next, an optimality analysis from a subspace perspective is performed, and a sufficient condition for optimal antenna configuration is established. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the achievable sum rate of the proposed beamformer approaches that of the optimal pure digital MMSE scheme, yet with much lower computational complexity and hardware cost.",

    "summary": "To decode a short linear block code, ordered statics decoding (OSD) and/or the $A^*$ decoding are usually considered. Either OSD or the $A^*$ decoding utilizes the magnitudes of the received symbols to establish the most reliable and independent positions (MRIP) frame. A restricted searched space can be employed to achieve near-optimum decoding with reduced decoding complexity. For a low-rate code with large minimum distance, the restricted search space is still very huge.\nWe propose to use concatenated coding to further restrict the search space by proposing an improved MRIP frame. The improved MRIP frame is founded according to magnitudes of log likelihood ratios (LLRs) obtained by the soft-in soft-out (SISO) decoder for the inner code.\nWe focus on the construction and decoding of several $(n,k)$ = (128,36) binary linear block codes based on concatenated coding. We use the (128,36) extended BCH (eBCH) code as a benchmark for comparison. Simulation shows that there exist constructed concatenated codes which are much more efficient than the (128,36) eBCH code. Some other codes of length 128 or close to 128 are also constructed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.",

    "summary": "We propose a new method for retrieving the algebraic structure of a generic alternant code given an arbitrary generator matrix, provided certain conditions are met. We then discuss how this challenges the security of the McEliece cryptosystem instantiated with this family of codes. The central object of our work is the quadratic hull related to a linear code, defined as the intersection of all quadrics passing through the columns of a given generator or parity-check matrix, where the columns are considered as points in the affine or projective space. The geometric properties of this object reveal important information about the internal algebraic structure of the code. This is particularly evident in the case of generalized Reed-Solomon codes, whose quadratic hull is deeply linked to a well-known algebraic variety called the rational normal curve. By utilizing the concept of Weil restriction of affine varieties, we demonstrate that the quadratic hull of a generic dual alternant code inherits many interesting features from the rational normal curve, on account of the fact that alternant codes are subfield-subcodes of generalized Reed-Solomon codes. If the rate of the generic alternant code is sufficiently high, this allows us to construct a polynomial-time algorithm for retrieving the underlying generalized Reed-Solomon code from which the alternant code is defined, which leads to an efficient key-recovery attack against the McEliece cryptosystem when instantiated with this class of codes. Finally, we discuss the generalization of this approach to Algebraic-Geometry codes and Goppa codes.",

    "summary": "Traditional entropy-based methods - such as cross-entropy loss in classification problems - have long been essential tools for quantifying uncertainty and disorder in data and developing artificial intelligence algorithms. However, the rapid growth of data across various domains has introduced new challenges, particularly the integration of heterogeneous datasets with intrinsic disparities. In this paper, we extend zentropy theory into the data science domain by introducing intrinsic entropy, enabling more effective learning from heterogeneous data sources. We propose a zentropy-enhanced neural network (ZENN) that simultaneously learns both energy and intrinsic entropy components, capturing the underlying structure of multi-source data. To support this, we redesign the neural network architecture to better reflect the intrinsic properties and variability inherent in diverse datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ZENN on classification tasks and energy landscape reconstructions, showing its superior generalization capabilities and robustness-particularly in predicting high-order derivatives. As a practical application, we employ ZENN to reconstruct the Helmholtz energy landscape of Fe3Pt using data generated from DFT and capture key material behaviors, including negative thermal expansion and the critical point in the temperature-pressure space. Overall, our study introduces a novel approach for data-driven machine learning grounded in zentropy theory, highlighting ZENN as a versatile and robust deep learning framework for scientific problems involving complex, heterogeneous datasets.",

This work introduces enhanced polar decoding ($\\mathsf{PD}^+$), a universal soft decoding algorithm that transforms any BLBC into a polar-like code compatible with efficient polar code decoders such as successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding. Key innovations in $\\mathsf{PD}^+$ include pruning polar kernels, shortening codes, and leveraging a simulated annealing algorithm to optimize transformations. These enable $\\mathsf{PD}^+$ to achieve competitive or superior performance to state-of-the-art algorithms like OSD and GRAND across various codes, including extended BCH, extended Golay, and binary quadratic residue codes, with significantly lower complexity. Moreover, $\\mathsf{PD}^+$ is designed to be forward-compatible with advancements in polar code decoding techniques and AI-driven search methods, making it a robust and versatile solution for universal BLBC decoding in both present and future systems.",

We show that, under theoretically ideal conditions, a continuous version of classic 1NN-DTW method can solve the stated problem, even when only one training sample is available. In addition, we propose an alternative dissimilarity measure based on Optimal Transport and show that it can also solve the aforementioned problem statement at a significantly reduced computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the newly proposed approach in simulated and real time series classification data, showing the efficacy of the method.",

Many of our results are optimal. For sub-Gaussian distributions we also provide a CSS which tracks a time-varying mean, generalizing Robbins' mixture approach to the multivariate setting. Finally, we provide several CSSs for heavy-tailed random vectors (two moments only). Our bounds hold under a martingale assumption on the mean and do not require that the observations be iid.

    "summary": "The selection of hyperparameters, such as prompt templates in large language models (LLMs), must often strike a balance between reliability and cost. In many cases, structural relationships between the expected reliability levels of the hyperparameters can be inferred from prior information and held-out data -- e.g., longer prompt templates may be more detailed and thus more reliable. However, existing hyperparameter selection methods either do not provide formal reliability guarantees or are unable to incorporate structured knowledge in the hyperparameter space. This paper introduces reliability graph-based Pareto testing (RG-PT), a novel multi-objective hyperparameter selection framework that maintains formal reliability guarantees in terms of false discovery rate (FDR), while accounting for known relationships among hyperparameters via a directed acyclic graph. Edges in the graph reflect expected reliability and cost trade-offs among hyperparameters, which are inferred via the Bradley-Terry (BT) ranking model from prior information and held-out data. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that RG-PT significantly outperforms existing methods such as learn-then-test (LTT) and Pareto testing (PT) through a more efficient exploration of the hyperparameter space.",

    "summary": "This work presents a joint design of encoding and encryption procedures for public key encryptions (PKEs) and key encapsulation mechanism (KEMs) such as Kyber, without relying on the assumption of independent decoding noise components, achieving reductions in both communication overhead (CER) and decryption failure rate (DFR). Our design features two techniques: ciphertext packing and lattice packing. First, we extend the Peikert-Vaikuntanathan-Waters (PVW) method to Kyber: $\\ell$ plaintexts are packed into a single ciphertext. This scheme is referred to as P$_\\ell$-Kyber. We prove that the P$_\\ell$-Kyber is IND-CCA secure under the M-LWE hardness assumption. We show that the decryption decoding noise entries across the $\\ell$ plaintexts (also known as layers) are mutually independent. Second, we propose a cross-layer lattice encoding scheme for the P$_\\ell$-Kyber, where every $\\ell$ cross-layer information symbols are encoded to a lattice point. This way we obtain a \\emph{coded} P$_\\ell$-Kyber, where the decoding noise entries for each lattice point are mutually independent. Therefore, the DFR analysis does not require the assumption of independence among the decryption decoding noise entries. Both DFR and CER are greatly decreased thanks to ciphertext packing and lattice packing. We demonstrate that with $\\ell=24$ and Leech lattice encoder, the proposed coded P$_\\ell$-KYBER1024 achieves DFR $<2^{-281}$ and CER $ = 4.6$, i.e., a decrease of CER by $90\\%$ compared to KYBER1024.",

Despite their widespread use, the algebraic theory underlying APAs has remained largely unexplored. In recent work, a notation for non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs) was introduced, along with a sound and complete axiomatisation of their equational theory via right-linear algebras. In this paper, we extend that line of work, in particular to the setting of infinite words. We present a dualised syntax, yielding a notation for APAs based on right-linear lattice expressions, and provide a natural axiomatisation of their equational theory with respect to the standard language model of {\\omega}-regular languages. The design of this axiomatisation is guided by the theory of fixed point logics; in fact, the completeness factors cleanly through the completeness of the linear-time {\\mu}-calculus.",

    "summary": "We present a self-contained analysis of infinity from two mathematical perspectives: set theory and algebra. We begin with cardinal and ordinal numbers, examining deep questions such as the continuum hypothesis, along with foundational results such as the Schr√∂der-Bernstein theorem, multiple proofs of the well-ordering of cardinals, and various properties of infinite cardinals and ordinals. Transitioning to algebra, we analyze the interplay between finite and infinite algebraic structures, including groups, rings, and $R$-modules. Major results, such as the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, Krull's Theorem, Hilbert's basis theorem, and the equivalence of free and projective modules over principal ideal domains, highlight the connections and differences between finite and infinite structures, as well as demonstrating the relationship between set-theoretic and algebraic treatments of infinity. Through this approach, we provide insights into how key results about infinity interact with and inform one another across set-theoretic and algebraic mathematics.",

    "summary": "Many first-order equational theories, such as the theory of groups or boolean algebras, can be presented by a smaller set of axioms than the original one. Recent studies showed that a homological approach to equational theories gives us inequalities to obtain lower bounds on the number of axioms. In this paper, we extend this result to higher-order equational theories. More precisely, we consider simply typed lambda calculus with product and unit types and study sets of equations between lambda terms. Then, we define homology groups of the given equational theory and show that a lower bound on the number of equations can be computed from the homology groups.",

We show that whenever the distance function is not Lipschitz in charts, the MCP may fail. This occurs already in fundamental examples such as the Martinet and Engel structures.\nCentral to our analysis are new results on the stability of the local MCP under quotients by isometric group actions for general metric measure spaces, developed under a weaker variant of the essential non-branching condition which, in contrast with the classical one, is implied by the minimizing Sard property in sub-Riemannian geometry.\nSince the MCP is preserved under blow-ups, we focus on Carnot homogeneous spaces, proving that MCP descends to suitable quotients. As a byproduct, any structure whose tangent at some point admits a quotient to Martinet fails the MCP. We also obtain a computation-free proof that the Grushin plane shares the Heisenberg group's MCP. Applications include a detailed analysis of validity and failure of the MCP for Carnot groups of low dimension.\nOur results suggest a conjecture on the failure of the MCP in presence of Goh abnormal geodesics satisfying the strong generalized Legendre condition.",

The CAP tiling has pure-point dynamical spectrum, which we compute explicitly, and comes from a natural cut-and-project scheme with 2-dimensional Euclidean internal space. All other members of the Hat family, in particular the original version constructed from 30-60-90 right triangles, are obtained via small modifications of the projection from this cut-and-project scheme.",

Explicit functional forms are used to show that the spectral form factors for $\\beta =1,2$ and 4 also admit an asymptotic expansion in $1/N^2$. Differential relations are identified expressing the first and second correction in terms of the limiting functional form, and evidence is presented that they hold for general $\\beta$.

We find that for moving solutions of the nKdV equation and the nmKdV equation written in the ``Lou form\" with $u(x,t) \\rightarrow u (x-ct)= u(\\xi) $, the equation for $u(\\xi)$ can be mapped to the equation for the static solutions of the 1+1 dimensional $\\phi^4$ field theory.

We also show that the nKdV equation can be derived from an Action Principle for both of its formulations. Furthermore, for both forms of the nmKdV equations as well as for both focusing and defocusing cases, we show that with a suitable ansatz one can decouple the $x$ and $t$ dependence of the nmKdV field $u(x,t)$ and obtain novel solutions in all the cases.

    "summary": "The Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of a general local gauge theory can be encoded in the structure of a so-called presymplectic gauge PDE -- an almost-$Q$ bundle over the spacetime exterior algebra, equipped with a compatible presymplectic structure. In the case of a trivial bundle and an invertible presymplectic structure, this reduces to the well-known AKSZ sigma model construction. We develop an extension of the presympletic BV-AKSZ approach to describe local gauge theories with background fields. It turns out that such theories correspond to presymplectic gauge PDEs whose base spaces are again gauge PDEs describing background fields. As such, the geometric structure is that of a bundle over a bundle over a given spacetime. Gauge PDEs over backgrounds arise naturally when studying linearisation, coupling (gauge) fields to background geometry, gauging global symmetries, etc. Less obvious examples involve parameterised systems, Fedosov equations, and the so-called homogeneous (presymplectic) gauge PDEs. The latter are the gauge-invariant generalisations of the familiar homogeneous PDEs and they provide a very concise description of gauge fields on homogeneous spaces such as higher spin gauge fields on Minkowski, (A)dS, and conformal spaces. Finally, we briefly discuss how the higher-form symmetries and their gauging fit into the framework using the simplest example of the Maxwell field.",

    "summary": "I introduce a novel mathematical framework integrating topological dynamics, operator algebras, and ergodic geometry to study lattices of asynchronous metric dynamical systems. Each node in the lattice carries an internal flow represented by a one-parameter family of operators, evolving on its own time scale. I formalize stratified state spaces capturing multiple levels of synchronized behavior, define an asynchronous evolution metric that quantifies phase-offset distances between subsystems, and characterize emergent coherent topologies arising when subsystems synchronize. Within this framework, I develop formal operators for the evolution of each subsystem and give precise conditions under which phase-aligned synchronization occurs across the lattice. The main results include: (1) the existence and uniqueness of coherent (synchronized) states under a contractive coupling condition, (2) stability of these coherent states and criteria for their emergence as a collective phase transition in a continuous operator topology, and (3) the influence of symmetries, with group-invariant coupling leading to flow-invariant synchrony subspaces and structured cluster dynamics. Proofs are given for each theorem, demonstrating full mathematical rigor. In a final section, I discuss hypothetical applications of this framework to symbolic lattice systems (e.g. subshifts), to invariant group actions on dynamical lattices, and to operator fields over stratified manifolds in the spirit of noncommutative geometry. Throughout, I write in the first person to emphasize the exploratory nature of this work. The paper avoids any reference to cosmology or observers, focusing instead on clean, formal mathematics suitable for a broad array of dynamical systems.",

    "summary": "This paper explores multiparameter quantum metrology using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)-type photon-added coherent states (PACS) and investigates both independent and simultaneous parameter estimation with linear and non-linear protocols, highlighting the significant potential of quantum resources to enhance precision in multiparameter scenarios. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we explicitly derive analytical expressions for the quantum Cram√©r-Rao bound (QCRB) for each protocol. Additionally, we compare the two estimation strategies, examining the behavior of their QCRBs and offering insights into the advantages and limitations of these quantum states in various contexts. Our results show that simultaneous estimation generally outperforms independent estimation, particularly in non-linear protocols. Furthermore, we analyze how the QCRB varies with the coherent state amplitude $|\\alpha|^2$, the number of estimated parameters $d$, and the photon excitation order $n$ across three protocols. The results indicate that increasing $|\\alpha|^2$ and decreasing $d$ improves estimation precision. For low $n$, the variation in the QCRB is similar for both symmetric and antisymmetric cases; however, at higher $n$, the antisymmetric case exhibits slightly better precision. The dependence on $d$ is comparable for both types of states. We also compare PACS-based GHZ states with NOON states and entangled coherent states, demonstrating the relative performance of each. Finally, we conclude with an analysis of homodyne detection in the context of a linear protocol, discussing its impact on estimation accuracy.",

    "summary": "We understand quantum principal bundle as faithfully flat Hopf--Galois extensions, with a structure Hopf algebra coacting on a total space algebra and with base algebra given by the coinvariant elements. To endow such bundles with a compatible differential structure, one requires the coaction to extend as a morphism of differential graded algebras. This leads to an exact noncommutative Atiyah sequence, a graded Hopf--Galois extension of differential forms and a canonical braiding on total space forms such that the latter are graded-braided commutative. We recall this approach to noncommutative differential geometry and further discuss the extension of quantum gauge transformations, in the sense of Brzezi≈Ñski, to differential forms. In this way we obtain an action of quantum gauge transformations on connections of the quantum principal bundle and their curvature. Explicit examples, such as the noncommutative 2-torus, the quantum Hopf fibration and smash product algebras are discussed.",

We find analytical formulae for Koopman modes defined coherently on the whole of the torus, and their decompositions associated with the partition of the torus into ergodic components. The spectrum of the Koopman operator is studied in four cases of CAT maps: cyclic, quasi-cyclic, critical (transition from quasi-cyclic to chaotic behaviour) and chaotic. We generalise these results to quantum CAT maps defined onto a noncommutative torus (and on its dual space). Finally, we study usual quantum chaos indicators onto quantum CAT maps from the viewpoint of the Koopman picture. The analogy with the classical case suggests that couples of these indicators are in fact necessary to certify a quantum chaotic behaviour.",

Equivalently, this model can be realised as $N$ eigenvalues of the complex Ginibre matrix of size $(c+1) N \\times (c+1) N$ conditioned to have deterministic eigenvalue $a$ with multiplicity $cN$. Depending on the values of $c$ and $a$, the droplet reveals a phase transition: it is doubly connected in the post-critical regime and simply connected in the pre-critical regime. In both regimes, we derive precise large-$N$ expansions of the free energy up to the $O(1)$ term, providing a non-radially symmetric example that confirms the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture made for general planar Coulomb gas ensembles. As a consequence, our results provide asymptotic behaviours of moments of the characteristic polynomial of the complex Ginibre matrix, where the powers are of order $O(N)$. Furthermore, by combining with a duality formula, we obtain precise large deviation probabilities of the smallest eigenvalue of the Laguerre unitary ensemble. Our proof is based on a refined Riemann-Hilbert analysis for planar orthogonal polynomials using the partial Schlesinger transform.",

In this work, we present a global well-posedness result for graphene in the Hartree- Fock approximation. The model allows to describe the time evolution of graphene in the presence of external time-dependent electric potentials, such as those induced by local charge defects in the monolayer of carbon atoms.

In the case of nearest neighbor hoppings, this model is known to give rise to limit shapes and arctic curves for large time and fermion number, with in particular two fluctuating regions which can be tuned to merge depending on ratio between time and N. Fluctuations near the merger are governed by a so-called tacnode kernel. In this paper we study the analogous picture in the presence of a next nearest interactions. In particular, we discuss the limit shapes, and compute analytically the corresponding density profile. We also study the behavior of correlations close to the merger point, and find a novel higher order tacnode kernel governing them.",

Particular attention is devoted to the analysis of non-elastic wave superpositions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise independent interactions of waves (quasi-rectifiability). In the case of the compressible Euler system, we describe the structure of the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of vector fields associated with waves. We prove that a certain class of Lie modules associated with a hydrodynamic-type systems can be uniquely transformed into a real Lie algebra in an angle-preserving manner. For the Euler system, we then demonstrate the connection between the transformed finite-dimensional Lie algebra and the infinite-dimensional algebra associated with waves. This enables a detailed investigation of the geometry of wave superpositions using tools from differential geometry and Lie group theory. In particular, we study the geometry of the manifold of wave superpositions in terms of deformations of submanifolds corresponding to Lie subalgebras associated with waves. Additionally, we present new methods and criteria for determining the quasi-rectifiability of Riemann k-waves.",

We provide a detailed construction of the categorical generalization of BF theory, dubbed BFCG, also known as 2BF. Similar to BF gravity, it is known that BFCG can be deformed to give general relativity. Here, we obtain an alternative relation between BFCG and gravity, which consists of coupling general relativity and BFCG by means of the volume form constructed out of the BFCG connections. The resulting theory, closely related to unimodular gravity, is a generalization of BF sequestered gravity not only in the sense that it adds new fields but also in that it allows for new choices for the volume form that is coupled to gravity. Furthermore, we show that BF sequestered gravity in the abelian case is recovered for a specific choice of the 2-group.",

The Pedersen metric can be derived from a curved twistor space which we conjecture to arise from a backreaction of self-dual gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant when coupled to a defect operator wrapping a certain $\\mathbb{CP}^1$ at infinity. The curved twistor space gives rise to a $2$-parameter deformation of the celestial symmetry algebra $Lw_\\wedge$ which reduces to previously studied algebras in various limits.",

    "summary": "We propose new noncommutative models of quantum phase spaces, containing a pair of $\\kappa$-deformed Poincar√© algebras, with two independent double ($\\kappa,\\tilde{\\kappa}$)-deformations in space-time and four-momenta sectors. The first such quantum phase space can be obtained by contractions $M,R\\to \\infty$ of recently introduced doubly $\\kappa$-deformed $(\\kappa,\\tilde{\\kappa})$-Yang models, with the parameters $M,R$ describing inverse space-time and four-momenta curvatures and constant four-vectors $a_\\mu, b_\\mu$ determining nine types of $(\\kappa,\\tilde{\\kappa})$-deformations. The second considered model is provided by the nonlinear doubly $\\kappa$-deformed TSR algebra spanned by 14 coset $\\hat{o}(1,5)/\\hat {o}(2)$ generators. The basic algebraic difference between the two models is the following: the first one, described by $\\hat{o}(1,5)$ Lie algebra can be supplemented by the Hopf algebra structure, while the second model contains the quantum phase space commutators $[\\hat{x}_\\mu,\\hat{q}_\\nu]$, with the standard numerical $i\\hbar\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}$ term; therefore it describes the quantum-deformed Heisenberg algebra relations which cannot be equipped with the Hopf algebra.",

    "summary": "Our main proposition is that field equations for all spins can be obtained from Casimir eigenvalue equations for Poincare group. We have already confirm that statement for massive scalar, spinor and vector fields in Ref.[1]. In the present article we are going to confirm this statement for massless vector, second and fourth rang tensor fields. In particular we will obtain Maxwell equations and Einstein equation in weak field approximation.\nAs is well known, Wigner define a particles as irreducible representation of Poincare group [2,3]. But, as Weinberg noted in [4] irreducible representations for massless vector field with helicities $\\pm 1$ do not exist. In the present article we will conform this statement for a wide class of massless fields. They are not Lorentz invariant since their Lorentz transformations have additional term in the form of gauge transformations. Such fields can appear in the theory only in the form which do not depend on corresponding gauge parameters. These forms are our equations of motion and they are by definition gauge invariant. So, the massless case is significantly different from massive one. In the end we will show that our approach can reproduce main contributions from well known articles with highest helicity.",

    "summary": "One of the most unconventional features of topological phases of matter is the emergence of quasiparticles with exotic statistics, such as non-Abelian anyons in two dimensional systems. Recently, a different type of exotic particle statistics that is consistently defined in any dimension, called parastatistics, is also shown to be possible in a special family of topological phases. However, the physical significance of emergent parastatistics still remains elusive. Here we demonstrate a distinctive physical consequence of parastatistics by proposing a challenge game that can only be won using physical systems hosting paraparticles, as passing the challenge requires the two participating players to secretly communicate in an indirect way by exploiting the nontrivial exchange statistics of the quasiparticles. The winning strategy using emergent paraparticles is robust against noise, as well as the most relevant class of eavesdropping via local measurements. This provides both an operational definition and an experimental identity test for paraparticles, alongside a potential application in secret communication.",

    "summary": "In the tight binding model with multiple degenerate vacua we might treat wave function overlaps as instanton tunnelings between different wells (vacua). An amplitude for such a tunneling process might be constructed as $\\mathsf{T}_{i\\to j}\\sim e^{-S_{\\mathrm{ inst}}}{\\mathbf{v}}_j^{+}{\\mathbf{v}}_i^{-}$, where there is canonical instanton action suppression, and $\\mathbf{v}_i^{-}$ annihilates a particle in the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ vacuum, whereas $\\mathbf{v}_j^{+}$ creates a particle in the $j^{\\mathrm{th}}$ vacuum. Adiabatic change of the wells leads to a Berry-phase evolution of the couplings, which is described by the zero-curvature Gauss-Manin connection i.e. by a quantum $R$-matrix. Zero-curvature is actually a consequence of level repulsion or topological protection, and its implication is the Yang-Baxter relation for the $R$-matrices. In the simplest case the story is pure Abelian and not very exciting. But when the model becomes more involved, incorporates supersymmetry, gauge and other symmetries, such amplitudes obtain more intricate structures. Operators $\\mathbf{v}_i^{-}$, $\\mathbf{v}_j^{+}$ might also evolve from ordinary Heisenberg operators into a more sophisticated algebraic object -- a ``tunneling algebra''. The result for the tunneling algebra would depend strongly on geometry of the QFT we started with, and, unfortunately, at the moment we are unable to solve the reverse engineering problem. In this note we revise few successful cases of the aforementioned correspondence: quantum algebras $U_q(\\mathfrak{g})$ and affine Yangians $Y(\\hat{\\mathfrak{g}})$. For affine Yangians we demonstrate explicitly how instantons ``perform'' equivariant integrals over associated quiver moduli spaces appearing in the alternative geometric construction.",

    "summary": "The interpretation of quantum measurements remains contested between collapse-based frameworks like the Copenhagen Interpretation and no-collapse approaches like the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI). We propose the Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI) as a minimalist alternative that preserves unitarity while avoiding both wavefunction collapse and ontological excess. BHSI models measurement as the unitary branching of a system's local Hilbert space into decoherent subspaces, formalized through causal state updates using branching and disengaging operators. Unlike MWI, BHSI avoids parallel worlds by maintaining a single-world ontology in which branching is confined to observable subspaces; unlike Copenhagen, it eliminates collapse while recovering the Born rule through branch weights. Through physically meaningful subspace records, the framework resolves quantum paradoxes such as particle-wave duality, Wigner and his friend, black hole radiation, etc. It remains consistent with interference patterns, entanglement correlations, and information preservation. By comparing BHSI with QBism, Relational Quantum Mechanics, and modal interpretations, as well as analyzing quantum teleportation (where locally decoherent Hilbert subspaces are observed), we demonstrate its advantages as a causally sound and empirically grounded approach that reconciles unitary evolution with definite measurement outcomes without metaphysical proliferation.",

    "summary": "Continuum models of plasticity fail to capture the richness of microstructural evolution because the continuum is a homogeneous construction. The present study shows that an alternative way is available at the mesoscale in the form of truly discrete constructions and in the discrete exterior calculus. A pre-existing continuum mean-field model with two parameters is rewritten in the language of the latter to model the properties of a network of plastic slip events in a perfect copper single crystal under uniaxial tension. The behaviour of the system is simulated in a triangular 2D mesh in 3D space employing a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Phases of distinct character emerge and both first-order and second-order phase transitions are observed. The phases can be interpreted as representing crystallographic phenomena like cross-slip, strain localisation and partial dislocations. The first-order transitions mostly occur as functions of the applied stress, while the second-order transitions occur exclusively as functions of the mean-field coupling parameter. The former are reminiscent of transitions in other statistical-mechanical models, while the latter find parallels in experimental observations.",

    "summary": "Fast Ewald summation is the most widely used approach for computing long-range Coulomb interactions in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. While the asymptotic scaling is nearly optimal, its performance on parallel architectures is dominated by the global communication required for the underlying fast Fourier transform (FFT). Here, we develop a novel method, ESP - Ewald summation with prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWFs) - that, for a fixed precision, sharply reduces the size of this transform by performing the Ewald split via a PSWF. In addition, PSWFs minimize the cost of spreading and interpolation steps that move information between the particles and the underlying uniform grid. We have integrated the ESP method into two widely-used open-source MD packages: LAMMPS and GROMACS. Detailed benchmarks show that this reduces the cost of computing far-field electrostatic interactions by an order of magnitude, leading to better strong scaling with respect to number of cores. The total execution time is reduced by a factor of 2 to 3 when using more than one thousand cores, even after optimally tuning the existing internal parameters in the native codes. We validate the accelerated codes in realistic long-time biological simulations.",

    "summary": "This work presents a methodology for reconstructing the spatial distribution of the neutron flux in a nuclear reactor, leveraging real-time measurements obtained from ex-core detectors. The Kirchhoff-Helmholtz (K-H) equation inherently defines the problem of estimating a scalar field within a domain based on boundary data, making it a natural mathematical framework for this task. The main challenge lies in deriving the Green's function specific to the domain and the neutron diffusion process. While analytical solutions for Green's functions exist for simplified geometries, their derivation of complex, heterogeneous domains-such as a nuclear reactor-requires a numerical approach. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the well-posedness of the data-driven Green's function approximation by formulating and solving the K-H equation as an inverse problem. After establishing the symmetry properties that the Green's function must satisfy, the K-H equation is derived from the one-speed neutron diffusion model. This is followed by a comprehensive description of the procedure for interpreting sensor readings and implementing the neutron flux reconstruction algorithm. Finally, the existence and uniqueness of the Green's function inferred from the sampled data are demonstrated, ensuring the reliability of the proposed method and its predictions.",

    "summary": "Isogeometric analysis (IGA) enables exact representations of computational geometries and higher-order approximation of PDEs. In non-smooth domains, however, singularities near corners limit the effectiveness of IGA, since standard methods typically fail to achieve optimal convergence rates. These constraints can be addressed through local mesh refinement, but existing approaches require breaking the tensor-product structure of splines, which leads to increased implementation complexity.\nThis work introduces a novel local refinement strategy based on a polar parameterization, in which one edge of the parametric square is collapsed into the corner. By grading the standard mesh toward the collapsing edge, the desired locality near the singularity is obtained while maintaining the tensor-product structure. A mathematical analysis and numerical tests show that the resulting isogeometric approximation achieves optimal convergence rates with suitable grading parameters.\nPolar parameterizations, however, suffer from a lack of regularity at the polar point, making existing standard isogeometric approximation theory inapplicable. To address this, a new framework is developed for deriving error estimates on polar domains with corners. This involves the construction of polar function spaces on the parametric domain and a modified projection operator onto the space of $C^0$-smooth polar splines. The theoretical results are verified by numerical experiments confirming both the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach.",

The DHMC was proposed in [Biometrika, 107(2)] for discontinuous potential where the variable has a fixed dimension. When the dimension changes, there is no clear explanation of the volume-preserving property, and the conservation of energy is also not necessary. We use a random sampling for the extra dimensions, which corresponds to a measure transform. We show that when the energy is corrected suitably for the trans-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics, the detailed balance condition is then satisfied. For the grand canonical ensemble, such a procedure can be explained very naturally to be the extra free energy change brought by the newly added particles, which justifies the rationality of our approach. To sample the grand canonical ensemble for interacting particle systems, the DHMC is then combined with the random batch method to yield an efficient sampling method. In experiments, we show that the proposed DHMC combined with the random batch method generates samples with much less correlation when compared with the traditional Metropolis-Hastings method.",

    "summary": "The invariant polytope algorithm was a breakthrough in the joint spectral radius computation, allowing to find the exact value of the joint spectral radius for most matrix families~\\cite{GP2013,GP2016}. This algorithm found many applications in problems of functional analysis, approximation theory, combinatorics, etc. In this paper we propose a modification of the invariant polytope algorithm enlarging the class of problems to which it is applicable. Precisely, we introduce mixed numeric and symbolic computations. A further minor modification of augmenting the input set with additional matrices speeds up the algorithm in certain cases. With this modifications we are able to automatically prove the finiteness conjecture for all pairs of binary $3\\times 3$ matrices and sign $2\\times 2$ matrices.",

    "summary": "The Riemannian manifold of curves with a Sobolev metric is an important and frequently studied model in the theory of shape spaces. Various numerical approaches have been proposed to compute geodesics, but so far elude a rigorous convergence theory. By a slick modification of a temporal Galerkin discretization we manage to preserve coercivity and compactness properties of the continuous model and thereby are able to prove convergence for the geodesic boundary value problem. Likewise, for the numerical analysis of the geodesic initial value problem we are able to exploit the geodesic completeness of the underlying continuous model for the error control of a time-stepping approximation. In fact, we develop a convergent discretization of a comprehensive Riemannian calculus that in addition includes parallel transport, covariant differentiation, the Riemann curvature tensor, and sectional curvature, all important tools to explore the geometry of the space of curves. Selected numerical examples confirm the theoretical findings and show the qualitative behaviour. To this end, a low-dimensional submanifold of Sobolev curves with explicit formulas for ground truth covariant derivatives and curvatures are considered.",

    "summary": "A general regularization strategy is considered for the efficient iterative solution of the lowest-order weak Galerkin approximation of singular Stokes problems. The strategy adds a rank-one regularization term to the zero (2,2) block of the underlying singular saddle point system. This strategy includes the existing pressure pinning and mean-zero enforcement regularization as special examples. It is shown that the numerical error maintains the optimal-order convergence provided that the nonzero Dirichlet boundary datum is approximated numerically with sufficient accuracy. Inexact block diagonal and triangular Schur complement preconditioners are considered for the regularized system. The convergence analysis for MINRES and GMRES with corresponding block preconditioners is provided for different choices of the regularization term. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are presented to verify the theoretical findings and the effectiveness of the preconditioning for solving the regularized system.",

    "summary": "We show that a broad range of convex optimization algorithms, including alternating projection, operator splitting, and multiplier methods, can be systematically derived from the framework of subspace correction methods via convex duality. To formalize this connection, we introduce the notion of dualization, a process that transforms an iterative method for the dual problem into an equivalent method for the primal problem. This concept establishes new connections across these algorithmic classes, encompassing both well-known and new methods. In particular, we show that classical algorithms such as the von Neumann, Dykstra, Peaceman--Rachford, and Douglas--Rachford methods can be interpreted as dualizations of subspace correction methods applied to appropriate dual formulations. Beyond unifying existing methods, our framework enables the systematic development of new algorithms for convex optimization. For instance, we derive parallel variants of alternating projection and operator splitting methods, as dualizations of parallel subspace correction methods, that are well-suited for large-scale problems on modern computing architectures and offer straightforward convergence guarantees. We also propose new alternating direction method of multipliers-type algorithms, derived as dualizations of certain operator splitting methods. These algorithms naturally ensure convergence even in the multi-block setting, where the conventional method does not guarantee convergence when applied to more than two blocks. This unified perspective not only facilitates algorithm design and the transfer of theoretical results but also opens new avenues for research and innovation in convex optimization.",

In most cases, $H^3$ regularity is omitted to get the optimal convergence rate for vector and scalar unknowns, and most of our results require a lower regularity for the vector variable than the scalar.

The optimization can be efficiently solved by a first-order splitting method with nearly optimal parameters, which has an $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ computational complexity and is flexible for parallel computation.

    "summary": "Fiber orientation is an important descriptor of the microstructure for short fiber polymer composite materials where accurate and efficient prediction of the orientation state is crucial when evaluating the bulk thermo-mechanical response of the material. Recent macroscopic fiber orientation models have employed the moment-tensor form in representing the fiber orientation state which all require a closure approximation for the higher order orientation tensors. In addition, various models have been developed to account for rotary diffusion due to fiber-fiber and fiber-matrix interactions which can now more accurately simulate the experimentally observed slow fiber kinematics in polymer composite processing. Traditionally explicit numerical IVP-ODE transient solvers like the 4th order Runge-Kutta method have been used to predict the steady-state fiber orientation state. Here we propose a computationally efficient method based on the Newton-Raphson iterative technique for determining steady state orientation tensor values by evaluating the exact derivatives of the moment-tensor evolution equation with respect to the independent components of the orientation tensor. We consider various existing macroscopic fiber orientation models and several closure ap-proximations to ensure the robustness and reliability of the method. The performance and stability of the approach for obtaining physical solutions in various homogeneous flow fields is demonstrated through several examples. Validation of the obtained exact derivatives of the orientation tensor is performed by benchmarking with results of finite difference techniques",

The key innovations include the development of equilibrium-based stress expressions, the modified cross-sectional stiffness matrix, and the mixed beam element model based on semi-analytical definition of internal force fields. In contrast to the conventional quasi-3D theory where stress expressions are derived from constitutive equations and geometric relations, the stress expressions in this study are derived from the differential equilibrium equations among stresses, ensuring strict adherence of stress solutions to equilibrium conditions. To incorporate the influence of equilibrium-derived stress distributions, the modified cross-sectional stiffness matrix is derived, enhancing the theoretical and practical feasibility of the beam model. For beam element construction, the mixed variational principle of two-field variables is employed, with generalized internal forces and generalized displacements regarded as two independent fields. Especially, semi-analytical internal force fields, which partially satisfy the differential equilibrium equations, are introduced to improve the element performance. Numerical examples are conducted to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed theory and beam element.",

    "summary": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are localized dilatations of the abdominal aorta that can lead to life-threatening rupture if left untreated. AAAs primarily affect older individuals, with high mortality rates following rupture, so early diagnosis and risk assessment are critical.

Despite the growing use of computational modeling for AAA investigation, there is a notable gap in accessible, open-source software capable of generating simulation-ready geometries for biomechanical and hemodynamic simulations. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{AneuPy}, an open-source Python-based tool designed to create both idealized and patient-specific AAA geometric models. \\textbf{AneuPy} is a fast and automated approach for generating aneurysm geometries from minimal input data, allowing for extensive parameter customization. By automating the creation of simulation-ready geometries for finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), or fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models, \\textbf{AneuPy} can facilitate research in AAA and improve patient-specific risk prediction.",

Then we introduce Narayana-type refinements of the super Catalan numbers. We prove algebraically the $\\gamma$-positivity of those refinements and give a combinatorial proof in a special case through the type B analog of noncrossing partitions. Then we introduce their natural $q$-analogs, prove their $q$-$\\gamma$-positivity and prove some identities they satisfy, generalizing identities of Kreweras and Le Jen-Shoo. Using yet another identity, we prove that these refinements are positive integer polynomials in $q$.",

    "summary": "We generalize the torsion vanishing results of Caraiani-Scholze and Koshikawa. Our results apply to the cohomology of general Shimura varieties $(\\mathbf{G},X)$ of PEL type $A$ or $C$, localized at a suitable maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m}$ in the spherical Hecke algebra at primes $p$ such that $\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathbb{Q}_{p}}$ is a group for which we know the Fargues-Scholze local Langlands correspondence is the semi-simplification of a suitably nice local Langlands correspondence. This is accomplished by combining Koshikawa's technique, the theory of geometric Eisenstein series over the Fargues-Fontaine curve, the work of Santos describing the structure of the fibers of the minimally and toroidally compactified Hodge-Tate period morphism for general PEL type Shimura varieties of type $A$ or $C$, and ideas developed by Zhang on comparing Hecke correspondences on the moduli stack of $G$-bundles with the cohomology of Shimura varieties. In the process, we also establish a description of the generic part of the cohomology that bears resemblance to the work of Xiao-Zhu. Moreover, we also construct a filtration on the compactly supported cohomology that differs from Manotovan's filtration in the case that the Shimura variety is non-compact, allowing us to circumvent some of the circumlocutions taken by Cariani-Scholze. Our method showcases a very general strategy for proving such torsion vanishing results, and should bear even more fruit once the inputs are generalized. Motivated by this, we formulate an even more general torsion vanishing conjecture.",

    "summary": "I introduce a novel mathematical framework integrating topological dynamics, operator algebras, and ergodic geometry to study lattices of asynchronous metric dynamical systems. Each node in the lattice carries an internal flow represented by a one-parameter family of operators, evolving on its own time scale. I formalize stratified state spaces capturing multiple levels of synchronized behavior, define an asynchronous evolution metric that quantifies phase-offset distances between subsystems, and characterize emergent coherent topologies arising when subsystems synchronize. Within this framework, I develop formal operators for the evolution of each subsystem and give precise conditions under which phase-aligned synchronization occurs across the lattice. The main results include: (1) the existence and uniqueness of coherent (synchronized) states under a contractive coupling condition, (2) stability of these coherent states and criteria for their emergence as a collective phase transition in a continuous operator topology, and (3) the influence of symmetries, with group-invariant coupling leading to flow-invariant synchrony subspaces and structured cluster dynamics. Proofs are given for each theorem, demonstrating full mathematical rigor. In a final section, I discuss hypothetical applications of this framework to symbolic lattice systems (e.g. subshifts), to invariant group actions on dynamical lattices, and to operator fields over stratified manifolds in the spirit of noncommutative geometry. Throughout, I write in the first person to emphasize the exploratory nature of this work. The paper avoids any reference to cosmology or observers, focusing instead on clean, formal mathematics suitable for a broad array of dynamical systems.",

    "summary": "We show that a broad range of convex optimization algorithms, including alternating projection, operator splitting, and multiplier methods, can be systematically derived from the framework of subspace correction methods via convex duality. To formalize this connection, we introduce the notion of dualization, a process that transforms an iterative method for the dual problem into an equivalent method for the primal problem. This concept establishes new connections across these algorithmic classes, encompassing both well-known and new methods. In particular, we show that classical algorithms such as the von Neumann, Dykstra, Peaceman--Rachford, and Douglas--Rachford methods can be interpreted as dualizations of subspace correction methods applied to appropriate dual formulations. Beyond unifying existing methods, our framework enables the systematic development of new algorithms for convex optimization. For instance, we derive parallel variants of alternating projection and operator splitting methods, as dualizations of parallel subspace correction methods, that are well-suited for large-scale problems on modern computing architectures and offer straightforward convergence guarantees. We also propose new alternating direction method of multipliers-type algorithms, derived as dualizations of certain operator splitting methods. These algorithms naturally ensure convergence even in the multi-block setting, where the conventional method does not guarantee convergence when applied to more than two blocks. This unified perspective not only facilitates algorithm design and the transfer of theoretical results but also opens new avenues for research and innovation in convex optimization.",

Our novel method, called Regularized Operator Extrapolation $(\\texttt{R-OpEx})$, is a single-loop algorithm that combines Tikhonov's regularization with operator extrapolation. This method needs only one operator evaluation for each operator per iteration and tracks one sequence of iterates. We show that $\\texttt{R-OpEx}$ gives $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-4})$ complexity in nonsmooth stochastic monotone BVI, where $\\epsilon$ is the error in the inner and outer levels. Using a mini-batching scheme, we improve the outer level complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ while maintaining the $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-4})$ complexity in the inner level when the inner level is smooth and stochastic. Moreover, if the inner level is smooth and deterministic, we show complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$. Finally, in case the outer level is strongly monotone, we improve to $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-4/5})$ for general BVI and $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2/3})$ when the inner level is smooth and deterministic.

However, this process is hindered by limitations inherent in the medical image data, such as noise and sparsity, as well as by complex valve dynamics. We present VALVEFIT, a novel GPU-accelerated and differentiable B-spline surface fitting framework that enables rapid reconstruction of smooth, analysis-suitable geometry from point clouds obtained via medical image segmentation. We start with an idealized TV B-spline template surface and optimize its control point positions to fit segmented point clouds via an innovative loss function, balancing shape fidelity and mesh regularization. Novel regularization terms are introduced to ensure that the surface remains smooth, regular, and intersection-free during large deformations. We demonstrate the robustness and validate the accuracy of the framework by first applying it to simulation-derived point clouds that serve as the ground truth. We further show its robustness across different point cloud densities and noise levels. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the framework toward fitting point clouds obtained from real patients at different stages of valve motion. An isogeometric biomechanical valve simulation is then performed on the fitted surfaces to show their direct applicability toward analysis. VALVEFIT enables automated patient-specific modeling with minimal manual intervention, paving the way for the future development of direct image-to-analysis platforms for clinical applications.",

    "summary": "A method is presented for the numerical solution of optimal boundary control problems governed by parabolic partial differential equations. The continuous space-time optimal control problem is transcribed into a sparse nonlinear programming problem through state and control parameterization. In particular, a multi-interval flipped Legendre-Gauss-Radau collocation method is implemented for temporal discretization alongside a Galerkin finite element spatial discretization. The finite element discretization allows for a reduction in problem size and avoids the redefinition of constraints required under a previous method. Further, a generalization of a Kirchoff transformation is performed to handle variational form nonlinearities in the context of numerical optimization. Due to the correspondence between the collocation points and the applied boundary conditions, the multi-interval flipped Legendre-Gauss-Radau collocation method is demonstrated to be preferable over the standard Legendre-Gauss-Radau collocation method for optimal control problems governed by parabolic partial differential equations. The details of the resulting transcription of the optimal control problem into a nonlinear programming problem are provided. Lastly, numerical examples demonstrate that the use of a multi-interval flipped Legendre-Gauss-Radau temporal discretization can lead to a reduction in the required number of collocation points to compute accurate values of the optimal objective in comparison to other methods.",

    "summary": "Recent work has shown that in certain settings, the Frank-Wolfe algorithm (FW) with open-loop step-sizes $\\eta_t = \\frac{\\ell}{t+\\ell}$ for a fixed parameter $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{N},\\, \\ell \\geq 2$, attains a convergence rate faster than the traditional $O(t^{-1})$ rate. In particular, when a strong growth property holds, the convergence rate attainable with open-loop step-sizes $\\eta_t = \\frac{\\ell}{t+\\ell}$ is $O(t^{-\\ell})$. In this setting there is no single value of the parameter $\\ell$ that prevails as superior. This paper shows that FW with log-adaptive open-loop step-sizes $\\eta_t = \\frac{2+\\log(t+1)}{t+2+\\log(t+1)}$ attains a convergence rate that is at least as fast as that attainable with fixed-parameter open-loop step-sizes $\\eta_t = \\frac{\\ell}{t+\\ell}$ for any value of $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{N},\\,\\ell\\geq 2$. To establish our main convergence results, we extend our previous affine-invariant accelerated convergence results for FW to more general open-loop step-sizes of the form $\\eta_t = g(t)/(t+g(t))$, where $g:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ is any non-decreasing function such that the sequence of step-sizes $(\\eta_t)$ is non-increasing. This covers in particular the fixed-parameter case by choosing $g(t) = \\ell$ and the log-adaptive case by choosing $g(t) = 2+ \\log(t+1)$. To facilitate adoption of log-adaptive open-loop step-sizes, we have incorporated this rule into the {\\tt this http URL} software package.",

This paper proposes a globalized distributionally robust chance-constrained (GDRC) SVM model based on core sets to address uncertainties in the dataset and provide a robust classifier. The globalization means that we focus on the uncertainty in the sample population rather than the small perturbations around each sample point. The uncertainty is mainly specified by the confidence region of the first- and second-order moments. The core sets are constructed to capture some small regions near the potential classification hyperplane, which helps improve the classification quality via the expected distance constraint of the random vector to core sets. We obtain the equivalent semi-definite programming reformulation of the GDRC SVM model under some appropriate assumptions. To deal with the large-scale problem, an approximation approach based on principal component analysis is applied to the GDRC SVM. The numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and advantage of our model.",

    "summary": "Numerical optimization (solving optimization problems using digital computers) currently dominates, but has three major drawbacks: high energy consumption, poor scalability, and lack of an execution time certificate. To address these challenges, this article explores the recent resurgence of analog computers, proposing a novel paradigm of arbitrarily small execution-time-certified analog optimization (solving optimization problems via analog computers). To achieve ultra-low energy consumption, this paradigm transforms optimization problems into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and leverages the ability of analog computers to naturally solve ODEs (no need for time-discretization) in physically real time. However, this transformation can fail if the optimization problem, such as the general convex nonlinear programs (NLPs) considered in this article, has no feasible solution. To avoid transformation failure and enable infeasibility detection, this paradigm introduces the homogeneous monotone complementarity problem formulation for convex NLPs. To achieve scalability and execution time certificate, this paradigm introduces the Newton-based fixed-time-stable scheme for the transformed ODE, whose equilibrium time $T_p$ can be prescribed by choosing the ODE's time coefficient as $k=\\frac{\\pi}{2T_p}$. This equation certifies that the equilibrium time (execution time) is independent of the dimension of optimization problems and can be arbitrarily small if the analog computer allows.",

    "summary": "We investigate the optimal pricing strategy in a service-providing framework, where customers can become impatient and leave the system prior to service completion. In this setting, a price is quoted to an incoming customer based on the current number of customers in the system. When the quoted price is lower than the price the incoming customer is willing to pay (which follows a fixed probability distribution), then the customer joins the system and a reward equal to the quoted price is earned. A cost is incurred upon abandonment and a holding cost is incurred for customers waiting to be served. Our goal is to determine the pricing policy that maximizes the long-run average profit. Unlike traditional queueing systems without abandonments, we show that the optimal quoted prices do not always increase with the queue length in this setting. In particular, we prove that the optimal pricing policy is always uni-modal and provide conditions guaranteeing that the optimal policy is increasing in the number of customers in the system. Moreover, we introduce two heuristics that simplify the optimal dynamic pricing policy. Both heuristics admit customers until the number of customers in the system reaches a certain threshold. The cutoff static policy charges all admitted customers a fixed price while the two price policy charges one price when the arriving customer can enter service immediately and another price if the customer needs to wait. By selecting the price(s) and threshold that maximize the long-run average profit, both heuristics achieve near optimality and the two price policy provides more robustness compared to the cutoff static policy.",

We also extend the equality cases of a primal-dual inequality involving the Goemans-Williamson semidefinite program, which approximates \\textsc{maxcut}, to graphs in certain coherent configurations. Moreover, we obtain spectral bounds for \\textsc{max 2-sat} when the underlying graphs belong to a symmetric association scheme by means of a certain semidefinite program used to approximate quadratic programs, and we further develop this technique in order to explicitly compute the optimum value of its gauge dual in the case of distance-regular graphs.",

    "summary": "We study the out-of-sample performance of multi-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in the fundamental stochastic convex optimization (SCO) model. While one-pass SGD is known to achieve an optimal $\\Theta(1/\\sqrt{n})$ excess population loss given a sample of size $n$, much less is understood about the multi-pass version of the algorithm which is widely used in practice. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that in the general non-smooth case of SCO, just a few epochs of SGD can already hurt its out-of-sample performance significantly and lead to overfitting. In particular, using a step size $\\eta = \\Theta(1/\\sqrt{n})$, which gives the optimal rate after one pass, can lead to population loss as large as $\\Omega(1)$ after just one additional pass. More generally, we show that the population loss from the second pass onward is of the order $\\Theta(1/(\\eta T) + \\eta \\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the total number of steps. These results reveal a certain phase-transition in the out-of-sample behavior of SGD after the first epoch, as well as a sharp separation between the rates of overfitting in the smooth and non-smooth cases of SCO. Additionally, we extend our results to with-replacement SGD, proving that the same asymptotic bounds hold after $O(n \\log n)$ steps. Finally, we also prove a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\eta \\sqrt{n})$ on the generalization gap of one-pass SGD in dimension $d = \\smash{\\widetilde O}(n)$, improving on recent results of Koren et al.(2022) and Schliserman et al.(2024).",

We show that whenever the distance function is not Lipschitz in charts, the MCP may fail. This occurs already in fundamental examples such as the Martinet and Engel structures.\nCentral to our analysis are new results on the stability of the local MCP under quotients by isometric group actions for general metric measure spaces, developed under a weaker variant of the essential non-branching condition which, in contrast with the classical one, is implied by the minimizing Sard property in sub-Riemannian geometry.\nSince the MCP is preserved under blow-ups, we focus on Carnot homogeneous spaces, proving that MCP descends to suitable quotients. As a byproduct, any structure whose tangent at some point admits a quotient to Martinet fails the MCP. We also obtain a computation-free proof that the Grushin plane shares the Heisenberg group's MCP. Applications include a detailed analysis of validity and failure of the MCP for Carnot groups of low dimension.\nOur results suggest a conjecture on the failure of the MCP in presence of Goh abnormal geodesics satisfying the strong generalized Legendre condition.",

    "summary": "This paper presents a risk-aware safe reinforcement learning (RL) control design for stochastic discrete-time linear systems. Rather than using a safety certifier to myopically intervene with the RL controller, a risk-informed safe controller is also learned besides the RL controller, and the RL and safe controllers are combined together. Several advantages come along with this approach: 1) High-confidence safety can be certified without relying on a high-fidelity system model and using limited data available, 2) Myopic interventions and convergence to an undesired equilibrium can be avoided by deciding on the contribution of two stabilizing controllers, and 3) highly efficient and computationally tractable solutions can be provided by optimizing over a scalar decision variable and linear programming polyhedral sets. To learn safe controllers with a large invariant set, piecewise affine controllers are learned instead of linear controllers. To this end, the closed-loop system is first represented using collected data, a decision variable, and noise. The effect of the decision variable on the variance of the safe violation of the closed-loop system is formalized. The decision variable is then designed such that the probability of safety violation for the learned closed-loop system is minimized. It is shown that this control-oriented approach reduces the data requirements and can also reduce the variance of safety violations. Finally, to integrate the safe and RL controllers, a new data-driven interpolation technique is introduced. This method aims to maintain the RL agent's optimal implementation while ensuring its safety within environments characterized by noise. The study concludes with a simulation example that serves to validate the theoretical results.",

    "summary": "We propose a new framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the agents cooperate in a time-evolving network with latent community structures and mixed memberships. Unlike traditional neighbor-based or fixed interaction graphs, our community-based framework captures flexible and abstract coordination patterns by allowing each agent to belong to multiple overlapping communities. Each community maintains shared policy and value functions, which are aggregated by individual agents according to personalized membership weights. We also design actor-critic algorithms that exploit this structure: agents inherit community-level estimates for policy updates and value learning, enabling structured information sharing without requiring access to other agents' policies. Importantly, our approach supports both transfer learning by adapting to new agents or tasks via membership estimation, and active learning by prioritizing uncertain communities during exploration. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees under linear function approximation for both actor and critic updates. To our knowledge, this is the first MARL framework that integrates community structure, transferability, and active learning with provable guarantees.",

We propose two algorithms that achieve near-optimal sample complexity. The first reduces the problem to a DR discounted Markov decision process (MDP), while the second, Anchored DR Average-Reward MDP, introduces an anchoring state to stabilize the controlled transition kernels within the uncertainty set. Assuming the nominal MDP is uniformly ergodic, we prove that both algorithms attain a sample complexity of $\\widetilde{O}\\left(|\\mathbf{S}||\\mathbf{A}| t_{\\mathrm{mix}}^2\\varepsilon^{-2}\\right)$ for estimating the optimal policy as well as the robust average reward under KL and $f_k$-divergence-based uncertainty sets, provided the uncertainty radius is sufficiently small. Here, $\\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\\mathbf{S}|$ and $|\\mathbf{A}|$ denote the sizes of the state and action spaces, and $t_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ is the mixing time of the nominal MDP. This represents the first finite-sample convergence guarantee for DR average-reward reinforcement learning.

    "summary": "Portfolio optimization involves selecting asset weights to minimize a risk-reward objective, such as the portfolio variance in the classical minimum-variance framework. Sparse portfolio selection extends this by imposing a cardinality constraint: only $k$ assets from a universe of $p$ may be included. The standard approach models this problem as a mixed-integer quadratic program and relies on commercial solvers to find the optimal solution. However, the computational costs of such methods increase exponentially with $k$ and $p$, making them too slow for problems of even moderate size. We propose a fast and scalable gradient-based approach that transforms the combinatorial sparse selection problem into a constrained continuous optimization task via Boolean relaxation, while preserving equivalence with the original problem on the set of binary points. Our algorithm employs a tunable parameter that transmutes the auxiliary objective from a convex to a concave function. This allows a stable convex starting point, followed by a controlled path toward a sparse binary solution as the tuning parameter increases and the objective moves toward concavity. In practice, our method matches commercial solvers in asset selection for most instances and, in rare instances, the solution differs by a few assets whilst showing a negligible error in portfolio variance.",

However, practical deployments face fundamental challenges due to heterogeneous computation speeds and unpredictable communication delays. This paper introduces a refined model of Asynchronous Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (ADSGD) under practical assumptions of bounded computation and communication times. To understand the convergence of ADSGD, we first analyze Asynchronous Stochastic Block Coordinate Descent (ASBCD) as a tool, and then show that ADSGD converges under computation-delay-independent step sizes. The convergence result is established without assuming bounded data heterogeneity. Empirical experiments reveal that ADSGD outperforms existing methods in wall-clock convergence time across various scenarios. With its simplicity, efficiency in memory and communication, and resilience to communication and computation delays, ADSGD is well-suited for real-world decentralized learning tasks.",

    "summary": "Assessing centrality in network systems is critical for understanding node importance and guiding decision-making processes. In dynamic networks, incorporating a controllability perspective is essential for identifying key nodes. In this paper, we study two control theoretic centrality measures -- the Volumetric Controllability Score (VCS) and Average Energy Controllability Score (AECS) -- to quantify node importance in linear time-invariant network systems. We prove the uniqueness of VCS and AECS for almost all specified terminal times, thereby enhancing their applicability beyond previously recognized cases. This ensures their interpretability, comparability, and reproducibility. Our analysis reveals substantial differences between VCS and AECS in linear systems with symmetric and skew-symmetric transition matrices. We also investigate the dependence of VCS and AECS on the terminal time and prove that when this parameter is extremely small, both scores become essentially uniform. Additionally, we prove that a sequence generated by a projected gradient method for computing VCS and AECS converges linearly to both measures under several assumptions. Finally, evaluations on brain networks modeled via Laplacian dynamics using real data reveal contrasting evaluation tendencies and correlations for VCS and AECS, with AECS favoring brain regions associated with cognitive and motor functions, while VCS emphasizes sensory and emotional regions.",

Despite considerable research effort, high-dimensional optimization problems over the Stiefel manifold remain challenging, particularly when the objective function is nonsmooth. In this paper, we propose a novel coordinate-type algorithm, named \\emph{randomized submanifold subgradient method} (RSSM), for minimizing a possibly nonsmooth weakly convex function over the Stiefel manifold and study its convergence behavior. Similar to coordinate-type algorithms in the Euclidean setting, RSSM exhibits low per-iteration cost and is suitable for high-dimensional problems. We prove that RSSM has an iteration complexity of $\\mathcal O(\\varepsilon^{-4})$ for driving a natural stationarity measure below $\\varepsilon$, both in expectation and in almost-sure senses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence guarantee for coordinate-type algorithms for nonsmooth optimization over the Stiefel manifold. To establish the said guarantee, we develop two new theoretical tools, namely a Riemannian subgradient inequality for weakly convex functions on proximally smooth matrix manifolds and an averaging operator that induces an adaptive metric on the ambient Euclidean space, which could be of independent interest. Lastly, we present numerical results on robust subspace recovery and orthogonal dictionary learning to demonstrate the viability of our proposed method.",

    "summary": "Smoothness is crucial for attaining fast rates in first-order optimization. However, many optimization problems in modern machine learning involve non-smooth objectives. Recent studies relax the smoothness assumption by allowing the Lipschitz constant of the gradient to grow with respect to the gradient norm, which accommodates a broad range of objectives in practice. Despite this progress, existing generalizations of smoothness are restricted to Euclidean geometry with $\\ell_2$-norm and only have theoretical guarantees for optimization in the Euclidean space. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing a new $\\ell*$-smoothness concept that measures the norm of Hessians in terms of a general norm and its dual, and establish convergence for mirror-descent-type algorithms, matching the rates under the classic smoothness. Notably, we propose a generalized self-bounding property that facilitates bounding the gradients via controlling suboptimality gaps, serving as a principal component for convergence analysis. Beyond deterministic optimization, we establish an anytime convergence for stochastic mirror descent based on a new bounded noise condition that encompasses the widely adopted bounded or affine noise assumptions.",

    "summary": "Organizations are collecting vast amounts of data, but they often lack the capabilities needed to fully extract insights. As a result, they increasingly share data with external experts, such as analysts or researchers, to gain value from it. However, this practice introduces significant privacy risks. Various techniques have been proposed to address privacy concerns in data sharing. However, these methods often degrade data utility, impacting the performance of machine learning (ML) models. Our research identifies key limitations in existing optimization models for privacy preservation, particularly in handling categorical variables, and evaluating effectiveness across diverse datasets. We propose a novel multi-objective optimization model that simultaneously minimizes information loss and maximizes protection against attacks. This model is empirically validated using diverse datasets and compared with two existing algorithms. We assess information loss, the number of individuals subject to linkage or homogeneity attacks, and ML performance after anonymization. The results indicate that our model achieves lower information loss and more effectively mitigates the risk of attacks, reducing the number of individuals susceptible to these attacks compared to alternative algorithms in some cases. Additionally, our model maintains comparable ML performance relative to the original data or data anonymized by other methods. Our findings highlight significant improvements in privacy protection and ML model performance, offering a comprehensive and extensible framework for balancing privacy and utility in data sharing.",

    "summary": "The Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving combinatorial optimisation problems. QAOA encodes solutions into the ground state of a Hamiltonian, approximated by a $p$-level parameterised quantum circuit composed of problem and mixer Hamiltonians, with parameters optimised classically. While deeper QAOA circuits can offer greater accuracy, practical applications are constrained by complex parameter optimisation and physical limitations such as gate noise, restricted qubit connectivity, and state-preparation-and-measurement errors, limiting implementations to shallow depths. This work focuses on QAOA$_1$ (QAOA at $p=1$) for QUBO problems, represented as Ising models. Despite QAOA$_1$ having only two parameters, $(\\gamma, \\beta)$, we show that their optimisation is challenging due to a highly oscillatory landscape, with oscillation rates increasing with the problem size, density, and weight. This behaviour necessitates high-resolution grid searches to avoid distortion of cost landscapes that may result in inaccurate minima. We propose an efficient optimisation strategy that reduces the two-dimensional $(\\gamma, \\beta)$ search to a one-dimensional search over $\\gamma$, with $\\beta^*$ computed analytically. We establish the maximum permissible sampling period required to accurately map the $\\gamma$ landscape and provide an algorithm to estimate the optimal parameters in polynomial time. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that for regular graphs on average, the globally optimal $\\gamma^* \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$ values are concentrated very close to zero and coincide with the first local optimum, enabling gradient descent to replace exhaustive line searches. This approach is validated using Recursive QAOA (RQAOA), where it consistently outperforms both coarsely optimised RQAOA and semidefinite programs across all tested QUBO instances.",

    "summary": "Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) offers a powerful paradigm of integrating data with physical laws to address important scientific problems, such as parameter estimation, inferring hidden physics, equation discovery, and state prediction, etc. However, PIML still faces many serious optimization challenges that significantly restrict its applications. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework that transforms PIML to convex optimization to overcome all these limitations, referred to as Convex-PIML. The linear combination of B-splines is utilized to approximate the data, promoting the convexity of the loss function. By replacing the non-convex components of the loss function with convex approximations, the problem is further converted into a sequence of successively refined approximated convex optimization problems. This conversion allows the use of well-established convex optimization algorithms, obtaining solutions effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, an adaptive knot optimization method based on error estimate is introduced to mitigate the spectral bias issue of PIML, further improving the performance. The proposed theoretically guaranteed framework is tested in scenarios with distinct types of physical prior. The results indicate that optimization problems are effectively solved in these scenarios, highlighting the potential of the framework for broad applications.",

Differing from the existing works on the expected reward criteria, our concern here is to maximize the probabilities that the accumulated rewards until the first passage time to any target set exceed a given goal, which represent the reliability of the players income. Under a mild condition, by developing a comparison theorem for the probability criterion, we prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium over history-dependent policies. Moreover, we provide an efficient algorithm for computing epsilon-Nash equilibria. Finally, we illustrate our main results by a nonstationary energy management model and take a numerical experiment.",

    "summary": "We study Sobolev and BV spaces on local trees which are metric spaces locally isometric to real trees. Such spaces are equipped with a Radon measure satisfying a locally uniform volume growth condition. Using the intrinsic geodesic structure, we define weak gradients and develop from it a coherent theory of Sobolev and BV spaces. We provide two main characterizations: one via Korevaar-Schoen-type energy functionals and another via the heat kernel associated with the natural Dirichlet form. Applications include interpolation results for Besov-Lipschitz spaces, critical exponents computations, and a Nash inequality. In globally tree-like settings we also establish $L^p$ gradient bounds for the heat semigroup.",

    "summary": "In the standard SIR model, infected vertices infect their neighbors at rate $\\lambda$ independently across each edge. They also recover at rate $\\gamma$. In this work we consider the SIR-$\\omega$ model where the graph structure itself co-evolves with the SIR dynamics. Specifically, $S-I$ connections are broken at rate $\\omega$. Then, with probability $\\alpha$, $S$ rewires this edge to another uniformly chosen vertex; and with probability $1-\\alpha$, this edge is simply dropped. When $\\alpha=1$ the SIR-$\\omega$ model becomes the evoSIR model. Jiang et al. proved in \\cite{DOMath} that the probability of an outbreak in the evoSIR model converges to 0 as $\\lambda$ approaches the critical infection rate $\\lambda_c$. On the other hand, numerical experiments in \\cite{DOMath} revealed that, as $\\lambda \\to \\lambda_c$, (conditionally on an outbreak) the fraction of infected vertices may not converge to 0, which is referred to as a discontinuous phase transition. In \\cite{BB} Ball and Britton give two (non-matching) conditions for continuous and discontinuous phase transitions for the fraction of infected vertices in the SIR-$\\omega$ model. In this work, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the emergence of a discontinuous phase transition of the final epidemic size of the SIR-$\\omega$ model on \\ER\\, graphs, thus closing the gap between these two conditions.",

Depending on the topology (vague/tight/weak/total-variational) and Kingman's notion of complete randomness, the limiting random measure is in one of four phases, distinguished by their degrees of concentration (support/domination/discreteness). Results are applied in the well-known Dirichlet and Polya tree families of random probability measures and in a new Gaussian family of signed inverse limit measures. In these three families, examples of all four phases occur and we describe the corresponding conditions on defining parameters.",

To study the learning complexity of functions with hierarchical structure, we study the noise stability of functions with tree hierarchical structure on independent inputs.

In the Boolean setting using the results of Dachman-Soled, Feldman, Tan, Wan and Wimmer (2014) our results provide Statistical Query super-polynomial lower bounds for learning classes that are based on hierarchical functions. Similarly, using the results of Diakonikolas, Kane, Pittas and Zarifis (2021) our results provide super-polynomial lower bounds for SQ learning under the Gaussian measure. Using the results of Abbe, Bengio, Cornacchiam, Kleinberg, Lotfi, Raghu and Zhang (2022) our results imply sample complexity lower bounds for learning hierarchical functions with gradient descent on fully connected neural networks.",

The workload process is observed according to an independent Poisson sampling process. The nonparametric estimator is constructed by first estimating the characteristic function (CF) and then applying an inversion formula. The convergence rate of the CF estimator at $s$ is shown to be of the order of $s^2/n$, where $n$ is the sample size. This convergence rate is leveraged to explore the bias-variance tradeoff of the inversion estimator. It is demonstrated that within a certain class of continuous distributions, the risk, in terms of MSE, is uniformly bounded by $C n^{-\\frac{\\eta}{1+\\eta}}$, where $C$ is a positive constant and the parameter $\\eta>0$ depends on the smoothness of the underlying class of distributions. A heuristic method is further developed to address the case of an unknown rate of the compound Poisson input process.",

Equivalently, this model can be realised as $N$ eigenvalues of the complex Ginibre matrix of size $(c+1) N \\times (c+1) N$ conditioned to have deterministic eigenvalue $a$ with multiplicity $cN$. Depending on the values of $c$ and $a$, the droplet reveals a phase transition: it is doubly connected in the post-critical regime and simply connected in the pre-critical regime. In both regimes, we derive precise large-$N$ expansions of the free energy up to the $O(1)$ term, providing a non-radially symmetric example that confirms the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture made for general planar Coulomb gas ensembles. As a consequence, our results provide asymptotic behaviours of moments of the characteristic polynomial of the complex Ginibre matrix, where the powers are of order $O(N)$. Furthermore, by combining with a duality formula, we obtain precise large deviation probabilities of the smallest eigenvalue of the Laguerre unitary ensemble. Our proof is based on a refined Riemann-Hilbert analysis for planar orthogonal polynomials using the partial Schlesinger transform.",

In doing so, we establish a rigorous connection between the Malliavin derivative, its adjoint, the Malliavin divergence (Skorokhod integral), and diffusion generative models, thereby providing a systematic method for computing $\\nabla \\log p_t(x)$. In the linear case, we present a detailed analysis showing that our formula coincides with the analytical score function derived from the solution of the Fokker--Planck equation. For nonlinear SDEs with state-independent diffusion coefficients, we derive a closed-form expression for $\\nabla \\log p_t(x)$. We evaluate the proposed framework across multiple generative tasks and find that its performance is comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

To endow such bundles with a compatible differential structure, one requires the coaction to extend as a morphism of differential graded algebras. This leads to an exact noncommutative Atiyah sequence, a graded Hopf--Galois extension of differential forms and a canonical braiding on total space forms such that the latter are graded-braided commutative. We recall this approach to noncommutative differential geometry and further discuss the extension of quantum gauge transformations, in the sense of Brzezi≈Ñski, to differential forms. In this way we obtain an action of quantum gauge transformations on connections of the quantum principal bundle and their curvature. Explicit examples, such as the noncommutative 2-torus, the quantum Hopf fibration and smash product algebras are discussed.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we extend Feigin-Frenkel duality at the critical level to the setting of complex rank. This is accomplished by considering the center of a vertex algebra in Deligne's interpolating categories, along with Feigin's Lie algebras of complex rank, $\\mathfrak{gl}_{\\lambda}$ and $\\mathfrak{po}_{\\lambda}$. More precisely, we define the universal affine vertex algebras associated with Lie algebras in $\\underline{\\mathrm{Re}}\\mathrm{p}(\\mathrm{GL}_{\\alpha},\\mathbb{F})$, $\\underline{\\mathrm{Re}}\\mathrm{p}(\\mathrm{O}_{\\alpha},\\mathbb{F})$ and $\\underline{\\mathrm{Re}}\\mathrm{p}(\\mathrm{Sp}_{\\alpha},\\mathbb{F})$, and describe their centers at the critical level explicitly by interpolating Molev's construction of Segal-Sugawara vectors. Using the formalism of Poisson vertex algebras, we identify a natural set of generators for the Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction of $\\mathfrak{gl}_{\\lambda}$ and $\\mathfrak{po}_{\\lambda}$, denoted by $\\mathcal{W}(\\mathfrak{gl}_{\\lambda})$ and $\\mathcal{W}(\\mathfrak{po}_{\\lambda})$, respectively. Finally, we show that the interpolated Feigin-Frenkel isomorphism maps the interpolated Segal-Sugawara vectors to these generators.",

    "summary": "In the tight binding model with multiple degenerate vacua we might treat wave function overlaps as instanton tunnelings between different wells (vacua). An amplitude for such a tunneling process might be constructed as $\\mathsf{T}_{i\\to j}\\sim e^{-S_{\\mathrm{ inst}}}{\\mathbf{v}}_j^{+}{\\mathbf{v}}_i^{-}$, where there is canonical instanton action suppression, and $\\mathbf{v}_i^{-}$ annihilates a particle in the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ vacuum, whereas $\\mathbf{v}_j^{+}$ creates a particle in the $j^{\\mathrm{th}}$ vacuum. Adiabatic change of the wells leads to a Berry-phase evolution of the couplings, which is described by the zero-curvature Gauss-Manin connection i.e. by a quantum $R$-matrix. Zero-curvature is actually a consequence of level repulsion or topological protection, and its implication is the Yang-Baxter relation for the $R$-matrices. In the simplest case the story is pure Abelian and not very exciting. But when the model becomes more involved, incorporates supersymmetry, gauge and other symmetries, such amplitudes obtain more intricate structures. Operators $\\mathbf{v}_i^{-}$, $\\mathbf{v}_j^{+}$ might also evolve from ordinary Heisenberg operators into a more sophisticated algebraic object -- a ``tunneling algebra''. The result for the tunneling algebra would depend strongly on geometry of the QFT we started with, and, unfortunately, at the moment we are unable to solve the reverse engineering problem. In this note we revise few successful cases of the aforementioned correspondence: quantum algebras $U_q(\\mathfrak{g})$ and affine Yangians $Y(\\hat{\\mathfrak{g}})$. For affine Yangians we demonstrate explicitly how instantons ``perform'' equivariant integrals over associated quiver moduli spaces appearing in the alternative geometric construction.",

    "summary": "We understand quantum principal bundle as faithfully flat Hopf--Galois extensions, with a structure Hopf algebra coacting on a total space algebra and with base algebra given by the coinvariant elements. To endow such bundles with a compatible differential structure, one requires the coaction to extend as a morphism of differential graded algebras. This leads to an exact noncommutative Atiyah sequence, a graded Hopf--Galois extension of differential forms and a canonical braiding on total space forms such that the latter are graded-braided commutative. We recall this approach to noncommutative differential geometry and further discuss the extension of quantum gauge transformations, in the sense of Brzezi≈Ñski, to differential forms. In this way we obtain an action of quantum gauge transformations on connections of the quantum principal bundle and their curvature. Explicit examples, such as the noncommutative 2-torus, the quantum Hopf fibration and smash product algebras are discussed.",

More precisely, we define the universal affine vertex algebras associated with Lie algebras in $\\underline{\\mathrm{Re}}\\mathrm{p}(\\mathrm{GL}_{\\alpha},\\mathbb{F})$, $\\underline{\\mathrm{Re}}\\mathrm{p}(\\mathrm{O}_{\\alpha},\\mathbb{F})$ and $\\underline{\\mathrm{Re}}\\mathrm{p}(\\mathrm{Sp}_{\\alpha},\\mathbb{F})$, and describe their centers at the critical level explicitly by interpolating Molev's construction of Segal-Sugawara vectors. Using the formalism of Poisson vertex algebras, we identify a natural set of generators for the Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction of $\\mathfrak{gl}_{\\lambda}$ and $\\mathfrak{po}_{\\lambda}$, denoted by $\\mathcal{W}(\\mathfrak{gl}_{\\lambda})$ and $\\mathcal{W}(\\mathfrak{po}_{\\lambda})$, respectively.

In this paper, we start by recalling a suitable description of the non-projective indecomposable modules for these group algebras.

This generalizes previous work by Mackey, Zimmer, Ellis, Austin, and the second author and Tao, and is inspired by the Furstenberg-Zimmer and Host-Kra structure theories for actions of uncountable groups. Our approach translates the ergodic-theoretic question into topological dynamics, where we establish a corresponding classification: an extension in topological dynamics has relative discrete spectrum precisely when it admits a skew-product representation by bundles of compact homogeneous spaces. A key step in our argument is establishing a Peter-Weyl-type theorem for bundles of compact groups which might be of independent interest.",

The G-linear semiorthogonal decompositions in question are compatible with the Bruhat order on cosets of the Weyl group of P in the Weyl group of G.

    "summary": "In the tight binding model with multiple degenerate vacua we might treat wave function overlaps as instanton tunnelings between different wells (vacua). An amplitude for such a tunneling process might be constructed as $\\mathsf{T}_{i\\to j}\\sim e^{-S_{\\mathrm{ inst}}}{\\mathbf{v}}_j^{+}{\\mathbf{v}}_i^{-}$, where there is canonical instanton action suppression, and $\\mathbf{v}_i^{-}$ annihilates a particle in the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ vacuum, whereas $\\mathbf{v}_j^{+}$ creates a particle in the $j^{\\mathrm{th}}$ vacuum. Adiabatic change of the wells leads to a Berry-phase evolution of the couplings, which is described by the zero-curvature Gauss-Manin connection i.e. by a quantum $R$-matrix. Zero-curvature is actually a consequence of level repulsion or topological protection, and its implication is the Yang-Baxter relation for the $R$-matrices. In the simplest case the story is pure Abelian and not very exciting. But when the model becomes more involved, incorporates supersymmetry, gauge and other symmetries, such amplitudes obtain more intricate structures. Operators $\\mathbf{v}_i^{-}$, $\\mathbf{v}_j^{+}$ might also evolve from ordinary Heisenberg operators into a more sophisticated algebraic object -- a ``tunneling algebra''. The result for the tunneling algebra would depend strongly on geometry of the QFT we started with, and, unfortunately, at the moment we are unable to solve the reverse engineering problem. In this note we revise few successful cases of the aforementioned correspondence: quantum algebras $U_q(\\mathfrak{g})$ and affine Yangians $Y(\\hat{\\mathfrak{g}})$. For affine Yangians we demonstrate explicitly how instantons ``perform'' equivariant integrals over associated quiver moduli spaces appearing in the alternative geometric construction.",

For a pre-fixed time $T^*$, the probability mass functions of the number of nodes obtained the message and the total number of nodes in the graph, as well as the distribution function of their ratio are derived. To this end, the success probability to disseminate the message from the node with the message to the node without message is proved. The exposition is illustrated by the simulation study.",

    "summary": "This paper proposes a robust and computationally efficient estimation framework for fitting parametric distributions based on trimmed L-moments. Trimmed L-moments extend classical L-moment theory by downweighting or excluding extreme order statistics, resulting in estimators that are less sensitive to outliers and heavy tails. We construct estimators for both location-scale and shape parameters using asymmetric trimming schemes tailored to different moments, and establish their asymptotic properties for inferential justification using the general structural theory of L-statistics, deriving simplified single-integration expressions to ensure numerical stability. State-of-the-art algorithms are developed to resolve the sign ambiguity in estimating the scale parameter for location-scale models and the tail index for the Frechet model. The proposed estimators offer improved efficiency over traditional robust alternatives for selected asymmetric trimming configurations, while retaining closed-form expressions for a wide range of common distributions, facilitating fast and stable computation. Simulation studies demonstrate strong finite-sample performance. An application to financial claim severity modeling highlights the practical relevance and flexibility of the approach.",

It postulates that synaptic changes occur locally, depending on the activities of pre- and postsynaptic neurons. While Hebbian learning based on neuronal firing rates is well explored, much less is known about learning rules that account for precise spike-timing. We relate a Hebbian spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule to noisy gradient descent with respect to a natural loss function on the probability simplex. This connection allows us to prove that the learning rule eventually identifies the presynaptic neuron with the highest activity. We also discover an intrinsic connection to noisy mirror descent.",

Motivated by constraints in domains such as medicine and marketing -- where online feedback is limited -- we propose a nonparametric algorithm that combines adaptive k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) regression with the upper confidence bound (UCB) principle. Our method, BaNk-UCB, is fully nonparametric, adapts to the context dimension, and is simple to implement. Unlike prior work relying on parametric or binning-based estimators, BaNk-UCB uses local geometry to estimate rewards and adaptively balances exploration and exploitation. We provide near-optimal regret guarantees under standard Lipschitz smoothness and margin assumptions, using a theoretically motivated batch schedule that balances regret across batches and achieves minimax-optimal rates. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BaNk-UCB consistently outperforms binning-based baselines.",

The workload process is observed according to an independent Poisson sampling process. The nonparametric estimator is constructed by first estimating the characteristic function (CF) and then applying an inversion formula. The convergence rate of the CF estimator at $s$ is shown to be of the order of $s^2/n$, where $n$ is the sample size. This convergence rate is leveraged to explore the bias-variance tradeoff of the inversion estimator. It is demonstrated that within a certain class of continuous distributions, the risk, in terms of MSE, is uniformly bounded by $C n^{-\\frac{\\eta}{1+\\eta}}$, where $C$ is a positive constant and the parameter $\\eta>0$ depends on the smoothness of the underlying class of distributions.

    "summary": "This paper investigates risk bounds for quantile additive trend filtering, a method gaining increasing significance in the realms of additive trend filtering and quantile regression. We investigate the constrained version of quantile trend filtering within additive models, considering both fixed and growing input dimensions. In the fixed dimension case, we discover an error rate that mirrors the non-quantile minimax rate for additive trend filtering, featuring the main term $n^{-2r/(2r+1)}V^{2/(2r+1)}$, when the underlying quantile function is additive, with components whose $(r-1)$th derivatives are of bounded variation by $V$. In scenarios with a growing input dimension $d$, quantile additive trend filtering introduces a polynomial factor of $d^{(2r+2)/(2r+1)}$. This aligns with the non-quantile variant, featuring a linear factor $d$, particularly pronounced for larger $r$ values. Additionally, we propose a practical algorithm for implementing quantile trend filtering within additive models, using dimension-wise backfitting. We conduct experiments with evenly spaced data points or data that samples from a uniform distribution in the interval $[0,1]$, applying distinct component functions and introducing noise from normal and heavy-tailed distributions. Our findings confirm the estimator's convergence as $n$ increases and its superiority, particularly in heavy-tailed distribution scenarios. These results deepen our understanding of additive trend filtering models in quantile settings, offering valuable insights for practical applications and future research.",

In this work we assume that an equilibrium exists, and study instead the identifiability of the graph from the stationary distribution, meaning that we seek a way to reconstruct the influence graph underlying the dynamic network using only static information. We use an approach from algebraic statistics that characterizes models using the Jacobian matroids associated with the parametrization of the models, and we introduce sufficient graphical conditions under which different graphs yield distinct steady-state distributions. Additionally, we illustrate how our results could be applied to characterize networks inspired by ecological research.",

While this area of statistics is often perceived -- somewhat naively -- as saturated, several misconceptions still affect everyday practice, and new frontiers have so far remained unexplored.

The contributions collected in this manuscript span from modeling and estimation to distribution-free goodness-of-fit tests.\nPerhaps the most surprising result presented here is that, in a sparse regime, all tests proposed in the literature are dominated by members of the class of weighted linear statistics.",

    "summary": "Given a pair of time series, we study how the periodicity of one influences the periodicity of the other. There are several known methods to measure the similarity between a pair of time series, such as cross-correlation, coherence, cross-recurrence, and dynamic time warping. But we have yet to find any measures with theoretical stability results.\nPersistence homology has been utilized to construct a scoring function with theoretical guarantees of stability that quantifies the periodicity of a single univariate time series f1, denoted score(f1). Building on this concept, we propose a conditional periodicity score that quantifies the periodicity of one univariate time series f1 given another f2, denoted score(f1|f2), and derive theoretical stability results for the same. With the use of dimension reduction in mind, we prove a new stability result for score(f1|f2) under principal component analysis (PCA) when we use the projections of the time series embeddings onto their respective first K principal components. We show that the change in our score is bounded by a function of the eigenvalues corresponding to the remaining (unused) N-K principal components and hence is small when the first K principal components capture most of the variation in the time series embeddings. Finally we derive a lower bound on the minimum embedding dimension to use in our pipeline which guarantees that any two such embeddings give scores that are within a given epsilon of each other.\nWe present a procedure for computing conditional periodicity scores and implement it on several pairs of synthetic signals. We experimentally compare our similarity measure to the most-similar statistical measure of cross-recurrence, and show the increased accuracy and stability of our score when predicting and measuring whether or not the periodicities of two time series are similar.",

    "summary": "Causal inference across multiple data sources offers a promising avenue to enhance the generalizability and replicability of scientific findings. However, data integration methods for time-to-event outcomes, common in biomedical research, are underdeveloped. Existing approaches focus on binary or continuous outcomes but fail to address the unique challenges of survival analysis, such as censoring and the integration of discrete and continuous time. To bridge this gap, we propose two novel methods for estimating target site-specific causal effects in multi-source settings. First, we develop a semiparametric efficient estimator for settings where individual-level data can be shared across sites. Second, we introduce a federated learning framework designed for privacy-constrained environments, which dynamically reweights source-specific contributions to account for discrepancies with the target population. Both methods leverage flexible, nonparametric machine learning models to improve robustness and efficiency. We illustrate the utility of our approaches through simulation studies and an application to multi-site randomized trials of monoclonal neutralizing antibodies for HIV-1 prevention, conducted among cisgender men and transgender persons in the United States, Brazil, Peru, and Switzerland, as well as among women in sub-Saharan Africa. Our findings underscore the potential of these methods to enable efficient, privacy-preserving causal inference for time-to-event outcomes under distribution shift.",

Building on recent work by von Davier (2025), we propose an adjusted estimator that corrects this bias by modifying both the numerator and denominator of the traditional formula. The new approximation incorporates a weighted average of component degrees of freedom and a scaling factor that ensures consistency as the number of components or their degrees of freedom increases. We demonstrate the utility of this adjustment in practical settings, including Rubin's (1987) total variance estimation in multiple imputations, where weighted variance combinations are common. The proposed estimator generalizes and further improves von Davier's (2025) unweighted case and more accurately approximates synthetic variance estimators with arbitrary weights.",
