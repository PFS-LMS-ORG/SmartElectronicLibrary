    "summary": "The United States Department of Defense (DOD) looks to accelerate the development and deployment of AI capabilities across a wide spectrum of defense applications to maintain strategic advantages. However, many common features of AI algorithms that make them powerful, such as capacity for learning, large-scale data ingestion, and problem-solving, raise new technical, security, and ethical challenges. These challenges may hinder adoption due to uncertainty in development, testing, assurance, processes, and requirements. Trustworthiness through assurance is essential to achieve the expected value from AI.\nThis paper proposes a claims-based framework for risk management and assurance of AI systems that addresses the competing needs for faster deployment, successful adoption, and rigorous evaluation. This framework supports programs across all acquisition pathways provide grounds for sufficient confidence that an AI-enabled system (AIES) meets its intended mission goals without introducing unacceptable risks throughout its lifecycle. The paper's contributions are a framework process for AI assurance, a set of relevant definitions to enable constructive conversations on the topic of AI assurance, and a discussion of important considerations in AI assurance. The framework aims to provide the DOD a robust yet efficient mechanism for swiftly fielding effective AI capabilities without overlooking critical risks or undermining stakeholder trust.",

    "summary": "Defeasible conditionals are a form of non-monotonic inference which enable the expression of statements like \"if $\\phi$ then normally $\\psi$\". The KLM framework defines a semantics for the propositional case of defeasible conditionals by construction of a preference ordering over possible worlds. The pattern of reasoning induced by these semantics is characterised by consequence relations satisfying certain desirable properties of non-monotonic reasoning. In FCA, implications are used to describe dependencies between attributes. However, these implications are unsuitable to reason with erroneous data or data prone to exceptions. Until recently, the topic of non-monotonic inference in FCA has remained largely uninvestigated. In this paper, we provide a construction of the KLM framework for defeasible reasoning in FCA and show that this construction remains faithful to the principle of non-monotonic inference described in the original framework. We present an additional argument that, while remaining consistent with the original ideas around non-monotonic reasoning, the defeasible reasoning we propose in FCA offers a more contextual view on inference, providing the ability for more relevant conclusions to be drawn when compared to the propositional case.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled conversational AI from traditional dialogue systems into sophisticated agents capable of autonomous actions, contextual awareness, and multi-turn interactions with users. Yet, fundamental questions about their capabilities, limitations, and paths forward remain open. This survey paper presents a desideratum for next-generation Conversational Agents - what has been achieved, what challenges persist, and what must be done for more scalable systems that approach human-level intelligence. To that end, we systematically analyze LLM-driven Conversational Agents by organizing their capabilities into three primary dimensions: (i) Reasoning - logical, systematic thinking inspired by human intelligence for decision making, (ii) Monitor - encompassing self-awareness and user interaction monitoring, and (iii) Control - focusing on tool utilization and policy following. Building upon this, we introduce a novel taxonomy by classifying recent work on Conversational Agents around our proposed desideratum. We identify critical research gaps and outline key directions, including realistic evaluations, long-term multi-turn reasoning skills, self-evolution capabilities, collaborative and multi-agent task completion, personalization, and proactivity. This work aims to provide a structured foundation, highlight existing limitations, and offer insights into potential future research directions for Conversational Agents, ultimately advancing progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

    "summary": "With the growing popularity of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach decision-making problems and create new opportunities for human-AI collaboration. In this article, we introduce a novel multi-layered hierarchical HITL DRL algorithm that comprises three types of learning: self learning, imitation learning and transfer learning. In addition, we consider three forms of human inputs: reward, action and demonstration. Furthermore, we discuss main challenges, trade-offs and advantages of HITL in solving complex problems and how human information can be integrated in the AI solution systematically. To verify our technical results, we present a real-world unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) problem wherein a number of enemy drones attack a restricted area. The objective is to design a scalable HITL DRL algorithm for ally drones to neutralize the enemy drones before they reach the area. To this end, we first implement our solution using an award-winning open-source HITL software called Cogment. We then demonstrate several interesting results such as (a) HITL leads to faster training and higher performance, (b) advice acts as a guiding direction for gradient methods and lowers variance, and (c) the amount of advice should neither be too large nor too small to avoid over-training and under-training. Finally, we illustrate the role of human-AI cooperation in solving two real-world complex scenarios, i.e., overloaded and decoy attacks.",

    "summary": "Formally verifying properties of software code has been a highly desirable task, especially with the emergence of LLM-generated code. In the same vein, they provide an interesting avenue for the exploration of formal verification and mechanistic interpretability. Since the introduction of code-specific models, despite their successes in generating code in Lean4 and Isabelle, the task of generalized theorem proving still remains far from being fully solved and will be a benchmark for reasoning capability in LLMs. In this work, we introduce a framework that generates whole proofs in a formal language to be used within systems that utilize the power of built-in tactics and off-the-shelf automated theorem provers. Our framework includes 3 components: generating natural language statements of the code to be verified, an LLM that generates formal proofs for the given statement, and a module employing heuristics for building the final proof. To train the LLM, we employ a 2-stage fine-tuning process, where we first use SFT-based training to enable the model to generate syntactically correct Isabelle code and then RL-based training that encourages the model to generate proofs verified by a theorem prover. We validate our framework using the miniF2F-test benchmark and the Isabelle proof assistant and design a use case to verify the correctness of the AWS S3 bucket access policy code. We also curate a dataset based on the FVEL\\textsubscript{\\textnormal{ER}} dataset for future training tasks.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are being widely applied across various fields, but as tasks become more complex, evaluating their responses is increasingly challenging. Compared to human evaluators, the use of LLMs to support performance evaluation offers a more efficient alternative. However, most studies focus mainly on aligning LLMs' judgments with human preferences, overlooking the existence of biases and mistakes in human judgment. Furthermore, how to select suitable LLM judgments given multiple potential LLM responses remains underexplored. To address these two aforementioned issues, we propose a three-stage meta-judge selection pipeline: 1) developing a comprehensive rubric with GPT-4 and human experts, 2) using three advanced LLM agents to score judgments, and 3) applying a threshold to filter out low-scoring judgments. Compared to methods using a single LLM as both judge and meta-judge, our pipeline introduces multi-agent collaboration and a more comprehensive rubric. Experimental results on the JudgeBench dataset show about 15.55\\% improvement compared to raw judgments and about 8.37\\% improvement over the single-agent baseline. Our work demonstrates the potential of LLMs as meta-judges and lays the foundation for future research on constructing preference datasets for LLM-as-a-judge reinforcement learning.",

    "summary": "Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately detect objects and interpret their surroundings. However, even when trained using millions of miles of real-world data, AVs are often unable to detect rare failure modes (RFMs). The problem of RFMs is commonly referred to as the \"long-tail challenge\", due to the distribution of data including many instances that are very rarely seen. In this paper, we present a novel approach that utilizes advanced generative and explainable AI techniques to aid in understanding RFMs. Our methods can be used to enhance the robustness and reliability of AVs when combined with both downstream model training and testing. We extract segmentation masks for objects of interest (e.g., cars) and invert them to create environmental masks. These masks, combined with carefully crafted text prompts, are fed into a custom diffusion model. We leverage the Stable Diffusion inpainting model guided by adversarial noise optimization to generate images containing diverse environments designed to evade object detection models and expose vulnerabilities in AI systems. Finally, we produce natural language descriptions of the generated RFMs that can guide developers and policymakers to improve the safety and reliability of AV systems.",

    "summary": "Agents that can autonomously navigate the web through a graphical user interface (GUI) using a unified action space (e.g., mouse and keyboard actions) can require very large amounts of domain-specific expert demonstrations to achieve good performance. Low sample efficiency is often exacerbated in sparse-reward and large-action-space environments, such as a web GUI, where only a few actions are relevant in any given situation. In this work, we consider the low-data regime, with limited or no access to expert behavior. To enable sample-efficient learning, we explore the effect of constraining the action space through $\\textit{intent-based affordances}$ -- i.e., considering in any situation only the subset of actions that achieve a desired outcome. We propose $\\textbf{Code as Generative Affordances}$ $(\\textbf{$\\texttt{CoGA}$})$, a method that leverages pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to generate code that determines affordable actions through implicit intent-completion functions and using a fully-automated program generation and verification pipeline. These programs are then used in-the-loop of a reinforcement learning agent to return a set of affordances given a pixel observation. By greatly reducing the number of actions that an agent must consider, we demonstrate on a wide range of tasks in the MiniWob++ benchmark that: $\\textbf{1)}$ $\\texttt{CoGA}$ is orders of magnitude more sample efficient than its RL agent, $\\textbf{2)}$ $\\texttt{CoGA}$'s programs can generalize within a family of tasks, and $\\textbf{3)}$ $\\texttt{CoGA}$ performs better or on par compared with behavior cloning when a small number of expert demonstrations is available.",

This automation drives digital transformation, often through gradual transitions that improve process efficiency and effectiveness. To fully assess the impact of such automation, a data-driven analysis approach is needed - one that examines how traditional and AI-enhanced process variants coexist during this transition. Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM) has emerged as a valuable method that enables such analysis, yet real-world case studies are still needed to demonstrate its applicability. This paper presents a case study from the insurance sector, where an LLM was deployed in production to automate the identification of claim parts, a task previously performed manually and identified as a bottleneck for scalability. To evaluate this transformation, we apply OCPM to assess the impact of AI-driven automation on process scalability. Our findings indicate that while LLMs significantly enhance operational capacity, they also introduce new process dynamics that require further refinement. This study also demonstrates the practical application of OCPM in a real-world setting, highlighting its advantages and limitations.",

    "summary": "Feature selection aims to preprocess the target dataset, find an optimal and most streamlined feature subset, and enhance the downstream machine learning task. Among filter, wrapper, and embedded-based approaches, the reinforcement learning (RL)-based subspace exploration strategy provides a novel objective optimization-directed perspective and promising performance. Nevertheless, even with improved performance, current reinforcement learning approaches face challenges similar to conventional methods when dealing with complex datasets. These challenges stem from the inefficient paradigm of using one agent per feature and the inherent complexities present in the datasets. This observation motivates us to investigate and address the above issue and propose a novel approach, namely HRLFS. Our methodology initially employs a Large Language Model (LLM)-based hybrid state extractor to capture each feature's mathematical and semantic characteristics. Based on this information, features are clustered, facilitating the construction of hierarchical agents for each cluster and sub-cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of our approach. Compared to contemporary or the one-feature-one-agent RL-based approaches, HRLFS improves the downstream ML performance with iterative feature subspace exploration while accelerating total run time by reducing the number of agents involved.",

Specifically, we investigate the generalizability of two state-of-the-art LLMs, DeepSeek and o1-preview, both equipped with reasoning capabilities, by generating ontologies from a set of competency questions (CQs) and related user stories. Our experimental setup comprises six distinct domains carried out in existing ontology engineering projects and a total of 95 curated CQs designed to test the models' reasoning for ontology engineering. Our findings show that with both LLMs, the performance of the experiments is remarkably consistent across all domains, indicating that these methods are capable of generalizing ontology generation tasks irrespective of the domain.

During the progression from AI to ASI, it may exceed human control, violate human values, and even lead to irreversible catastrophic consequences in extreme cases. This gives rise to a pressing issue that needs to be addressed: superalignment, ensuring that AI systems much smarter than humans, remain aligned with human (compatible) intentions and values. Existing scalable oversight and weak-to-strong generalization methods may prove substantially infeasible and inadequate when facing ASI. We must explore safer and more pluralistic frameworks and approaches for superalignment. In this paper, we redefine superalignment as the human-AI co-alignment towards a sustainable symbiotic society, and highlight a framework that integrates external oversight and intrinsic proactive alignment. External oversight superalignment should be grounded in human-centered ultimate decision, supplemented by interpretable automated evaluation and correction, to achieve continuous alignment with humanity's evolving values. Intrinsic proactive superalignment is rooted in a profound understanding of the self, others, and society, integrating self-awareness, self-reflection, and empathy to spontaneously infer human intentions, distinguishing good from evil and proactively considering human well-being, ultimately attaining human-AI co-alignment through iterative interaction. The integration of externally-driven oversight with intrinsically-driven proactive alignment empowers sustainable symbiotic societies through human-AI co-alignment, paving the way for achieving safe and beneficial AGI and ASI for good, for human, and for a symbiotic ecology.",

This development represents a significant progression in the realm of hybrid workflows, where human and artificial intelligence collaborate to address user intentions, with the former responsible for defining these intentions and the latter for implementing the solutions to address them.

    "summary": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) once showed increasing alignment with primate neural responses as they improved on computer vision benchmarks. This trend raised the exciting possibility that better models of biological vision would come as a byproduct of the deep learning revolution in artificial intelligence. However, the trend has reversed over recent years as DNNs have scaled to human or superhuman recognition accuracy, a divergence that may stem from modern DNNs learning to rely on different visual features than primates to solve tasks. Where will better computational models of biological vision come from? We propose that vision science must break from artificial intelligence to develop algorithms that are designed with biological visual systems in mind instead of internet data benchmarks. We predict that the next generation of deep learning models of biological vision will be trained with data diets, training routines, and objectives that are closer to those that shape human vision than those that are in use today.",

This paper introduces S2Vec, a novel self-supervised framework for learning such geospatial embeddings. S2Vec uses the S2 Geometry library to partition large areas into discrete S2 cells, rasterizes built environment feature vectors within cells as images, and applies masked autoencoding on these rasterized images to encode the feature vectors. This approach yields task-agnostic embeddings that capture local feature characteristics and broader spatial relationships. We evaluate S2Vec on three large-scale socioeconomic prediction tasks, showing its competitive performance against state-of-the-art image-based embeddings. We also explore the benefits of combining S2Vec embeddings with image-based embeddings downstream, showing that such multimodal fusion can often improve performance. Our results highlight how S2Vec can learn effective general-purpose geospatial representations and how it can complement other data modalities in geospatial artificial intelligence.",

However, existing methods oversimplify transportation choices in modern cities, and require prohibitive computational resources for large-scale population simulation. To address these limitations, we first present a virtual city that features multiple functional buildings and transportation modes. Then, we conduct extensive surveys to model behavioral choices and mobility preferences among population groups. Building on these insights, we introduce a simulation framework that captures the complexity of urban mobility while remaining scalable, enabling the simulation of over 4,000 agents. To assess the realism of the generated behaviors, we perform a series of micro and macro-level analyses. Beyond mere performance comparison, we explore insightful experiments, such as predicting crowd density from movement patterns and identifying trends in vehicle preferences across agent demographics.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces SCRAG, a prediction framework inspired by social computing, designed to forecast community responses to real or hypothetical social media posts. SCRAG can be used by public relations specialists (e.g., to craft messaging in ways that avoid unintended misinterpretations) or public figures and influencers (e.g., to anticipate social responses), among other applications related to public sentiment prediction, crisis management, and social what-if analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in generating coherent and contextually rich text, their reliance on static training data and susceptibility to hallucinations limit their effectiveness at response forecasting in dynamic social media environments. SCRAG overcomes these challenges by integrating LLMs with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique rooted in social computing. Specifically, our framework retrieves (i) historical responses from the target community to capture their ideological, semantic, and emotional makeup, and (ii) external knowledge from sources such as news articles to inject time-sensitive context. This information is then jointly used to forecast the responses of the target community to new posts or narratives. Extensive experiments across six scenarios on the X platform (formerly Twitter), tested with various embedding models and LLMs, demonstrate over 10% improvements on average in key evaluation metrics. A concrete example further shows its effectiveness in capturing diverse ideologies and nuances. Our work provides a social computing tool for applications where accurate and concrete insights into community responses are crucial.",

Although Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is a standard tokenization method in multilingual language models, its suitability for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in low resource Indic languages remains underexplored due to its limitations in handling morphological complexity. In this work, we systematically compare BPE, SentencePiece, and Character Level tokenization strategies using IndicBERT for NER tasks in low resource Indic languages like Assamese, Bengali, Marathi, and Odia, as well as extremely low resource Indic languages like Santali, Manipuri, and Sindhi. We assess both intrinsic linguistic properties tokenization efficiency, out of vocabulary (OOV) rates, and morphological preservation as well as extrinsic downstream performance, including fine tuning and zero shot cross lingual transfer.\nOur experiments show that SentencePiece is a consistently better performing approach than BPE for NER in low resource Indic Languages, particularly in zero shot cross lingual settings, as it better preserves entity consistency. While BPE provides the most compact tokenization form, it is not capable of generalization because it misclassifies or even fails to recognize entity labels when tested on unseen languages. In contrast, SentencePiece constitutes a better linguistic structural preservation model, benefiting extremely low resource and morphologically rich Indic languages, such as Santali and Manipuri, for superior entity recognition, as well as high generalization across scripts, such as Sindhi, written in Arabic. The results point to SentencePiece as the more effective tokenization strategy for NER within multilingual and low resource Indic NLP applications.",

In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework to analyze the feasibility of automatically detecting hallucinations produced by large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the classical Gold-Angluin framework for language identification and its recent adaptation to language generation by Kleinberg and Mullainathan, we investigate whether an algorithm, trained on examples drawn from an unknown target language $K$ (selected from a countable collection) and given access to an LLM, can reliably determine whether the LLM's outputs are correct or constitute hallucinations.\nFirst, we establish an equivalence between hallucination detection and the classical task of language identification. We prove that any hallucination detection method can be converted into a language identification method, and conversely, algorithms solving language identification can be adapted for hallucination detection. Given the inherent difficulty of language identification, this implies that hallucination detection is fundamentally impossible for most language collections if the detector is trained using only correct examples from the target language.\nSecond, we show that the use of expert-labeled feedback, i.e., training the detector with both positive examples (correct statements) and negative examples (explicitly labeled incorrect statements), dramatically changes this conclusion. Under this enriched training regime, automated hallucination detection becomes possible for all countable language collections.\nThese results highlight the essential role of expert-labeled examples in training hallucination detectors and provide theoretical support for feedback-based methods, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which have proven critical for reliable LLM deployment.",

In this paper, we first reduce monotonicity to asking whether the reachability probability from a given state is never less than that of another given state. Recent results for the latter property imply an efficient algorithm to collapse same-value equivalence classes, which in turn preserves verification results and monotonicity. We implement our algorithm to collapse \"trivial\" equivalence classes in the pMC and show empirical evidence for the following: First, the collapse gives reductions in size for some existing benchmarks and significant reductions on some custom benchmarks; Second, the collapse speeds up existing algorithms to check monotonicity and parameter lifting, and hence can be used as a fast pre-processing step in practice.",

However, it remains an open question as to how best to evaluate salience maps, with three families of evaluation methods commonly being used: subjective user measures, objective user measures, and mathematical metrics. We examine three of the most popular saliency map approaches (viz., LIME, Grad-CAM, and Guided Backpropagation) in a between subject study (N=166) across these families of evaluation methods. We test 1) for subjective measures, if the maps differ with respect to user trust and satisfaction; 2) for objective measures, if the maps increase users' abilities and thus understanding of a model; 3) for mathematical metrics, which map achieves the best ratings across metrics; and 4) whether the mathematical metrics can be associated with objective user measures. To our knowledge, our study is the first to compare several salience maps across all these evaluation methods$-$with the finding that they do not agree in their assessment (i.e., there was no difference concerning trust and satisfaction, Grad-CAM improved users' abilities best, and Guided Backpropagation had the most favorable mathematical metrics). Additionally, we show that some mathematical metrics were associated with user understanding, although this relationship was often counterintuitive.

FourCastNetv2 is an NVIDIA's advanced neural network for weather prediction and is trained on a 73-channel subset of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset at single levels and different pressure levels. Although the training specifications for FourCastNetv2 are not released to the public, the training documentation of the model's first generation, FourCastNet, is available to all users. The training had 64 A100 GPUs and took 16 hours to complete. Although NVIDIA's models offer significant reductions in both time and cost compared to traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), reproducing published forecasting results presents ongoing challenges for resource-constrained university research groups with limited GPU availability. We demonstrate both (i) leveraging FourCastNetv2 to create predictions through the designated application programming interface (API) and (ii) utilizing NVIDIA hardware to train the original FourCastNet model. Further, this paper demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of NVIDIA A100's for resource-limited research groups in universities. We also explore data management, training efficiency, and model validation, highlighting the advantages and challenges of using limited high-performance computing resources. Consequently, this paper and its corresponding GitHub materials may serve as an initial guide for other university research groups and courses related to machine learning, climate science, and data science to develop research and education programs on AI weather forecasting, and hence help democratize the AI NWP in the digital economy.",

Adaptive Optics (AO) systems are designed to counteract these effects, using atmospheric measurements captured by a wavefront sensor to make real-time corrections to the incoming wavefront. The Fried parameter, r0, characterises the strength of atmospheric turbulence and is an essential control parameter for optimising the performance of AO systems and more recently sky profiling for Free Space Optical (FSO) communication channels. In this paper, we develop a novel data-driven approach, adapting machine learning methods from computer vision for Fried parameter estimation from a single Shack-Hartmann or pyramid wavefront sensor image. Using these data-driven methods, we present a detailed simulation-based evaluation of our approach using the open-source COMPASS AO simulation tool to evaluate both the Shack-Hartmann and pyramid wavefront sensors. Our evaluation is over a range of guide star magnitudes, and realistic noise, atmospheric and instrument conditions. Remarkably, we are able to develop a single network-based estimator that is accurate in both open and closed-loop AO configurations. Our method accurately estimates the Fried parameter from a single WFS image directly from AO telemetry to a few millimetres. Our approach is suitable for real time control, exhibiting 0.83ms r0 inference times on retail NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU hardware, and thereby demonstrating a compelling economic solution for use in real-time instrument control.",

Our approach comprises two key components. First, Dynamic Token Merging (DToMe) reduces the number of visual token embeddings by merging similar tokens based on image complexity, addressing the inherent inefficiency of fixed-length outputs in vision transformers. Second, Virtual Token Unmerging (VTU) simulates the expected token sequence for large language models (LLMs) by efficiently reconstructing the attention dynamics of a full sequence, thus preserving the downstream performance without additional fine-tuning. Unlike previous approaches, our method dynamically adapts token compression to the content of the image and operates completely training-free, making it readily applicable to most state-of-the-art VLM architectures. Extensive experiments on image and video understanding tasks demonstrate that DyMU can reduce the average visual token count by 32%-85% while achieving comparable performance to full-length models across diverse VLM architectures, including the recently popularized AnyRes-based visual encoders. Furthermore, through qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that DToMe effectively adapts token reduction based on image complexity and, unlike existing systems, provides users more control over computational costs.

    "summary": "AI-powered facial assessment tools are reshaping how individuals evaluate appearance and internalize social judgments. This study examines the psychological impact of such tools on self-objectification, self-esteem, and emotional responses, with attention to gender differences. Two samples used distinct versions of a facial analysis tool: one overtly critical (N=75; M=22.9 years), and another more neutral (N=51; M=19.9 years). Participants completed validated self-objectification and self-esteem scales and custom items measuring emotion, digital/physical appearance enhancement (DAE, PAEE), and perceived social emotion (PSE). Results revealed consistent links between high self-objectification, low self-esteem, and increased appearance enhancement behaviors across both versions. Despite softer framing, the newer tool still evoked negative emotional responses (U=1466.5, p=0.013), indicating implicit feedback may reinforce appearance-related insecurities. Gender differences emerged in DAE (p=0.025) and PSE (p<0.001), with females more prone to digital enhancement and less likely to perceive emotional impact in others. These findings reveal how AI tools may unintentionally reinforce and amplify existing social biases and underscore the critical need for responsible AI design and development. Future research will investigate how human ideologies embedded in the training data of such tools shape their evaluative outputs, and how these, in turn, influence user attitudes and decisions.",

Existing generative models produce compelling synthetic samples but lack rigorous statistical guarantees about their relation to the underlying data distribution, limiting their applicability in critical domains requiring robust error bounds. We address this fundamental limitation by presenting a novel framework that incorporates conformal prediction methodologies into Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By integrating multiple conformal prediction paradigms including Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP), Mondrian Conformal Prediction, Cross-Conformal Prediction, and Venn-Abers Predictors, we establish distribution-free uncertainty quantification in generated samples. This approach, termed Conformalized GAN (cGAN), demonstrates enhanced calibration properties while maintaining the generative power of traditional GANs, producing synthetic data with provable statistical guarantees. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing finite-sample validity guarantees and asymptotic efficiency properties, enabling the reliable application of synthetic data in high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.",

    "summary": "Autoregressive patch-based image generation has recently shown competitive results in terms of image quality and scalability. It can also be easily integrated and scaled within Vision-Language models. Nevertheless, autoregressive models require a defined order for patch generation. While a natural order based on the dictation of the words makes sense for text generation, there is no inherent generation order that exists for image generation. Traditionally, a raster-scan order (from top-left to bottom-right) guides autoregressive image generation models. In this paper, we argue that this order is suboptimal, as it fails to respect the causality of the image content: for instance, when conditioned on a visual description of a sunset, an autoregressive model may generate clouds before the sun, even though the color of clouds should depend on the color of the sun and not the inverse. In this work, we show that first by training a model to generate patches in any-given-order, we can infer both the content and the location (order) of each patch during generation. Secondly, we use these extracted orders to finetune the any-given-order model to produce better-quality images. Through our experiments, we show on two datasets that this new generation method produces better images than the traditional raster-scan approach, with similar training costs and no extra annotations.",

Traditional inverse-design approaches--whether driven by human intuition, global optimization, or adjoint-based gradient methods--often involve intricate binarization and filtering steps, while recent deep learning strategies demand prohibitively large numbers of simulations (10^5 to 10^6). To overcome these limitations, we present AdjointDiffusion, a physics-guided framework that integrates adjoint sensitivity gradients into the sampling process of diffusion models. AdjointDiffusion begins by training a diffusion network on a synthetic, fabrication-aware dataset of binary masks. During inference, we compute the adjoint gradient of a candidate structure and inject this physics-based guidance at each denoising step, steering the generative process toward high figure-of-merit (FoM) solutions without additional post-processing. We demonstrate our method on two canonical photonic design problems--a bent waveguide and a CMOS image sensor color router--and show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art nonlinear optimizers (such as MMA and SLSQP) in both efficiency and manufacturability, while using orders of magnitude fewer simulations (approximately 2 x 10^2) than pure deep learning approaches (approximately 10^5 to 10^6). By eliminating complex binarization schedules and minimizing simulation overhead, AdjointDiffusion offers a streamlined, simulation-efficient, and fabrication-aware pipeline for next-generation photonic device design.

Here we demonstrate a knowledge-injected Bayesian optimization approach for adaptive XANES data collection that incorporates understanding of spectral features like absorption edges and pre-edge peaks. We show this method accurately reconstructs the absorption edge of XANES spectra using only 15-20% of the measurement points typically needed for conventional sampling, while maintaining the ability to determine the x-ray energy of the sharp peak after absorption edge with errors less than 0.03 eV, the absorption edge with errors less than 0.1 eV; and overall root-mean-square errors less than 0.005 compared to compared to traditionally sampled spectra. Our experiments on battery materials and catalysts demonstrate the method's effectiveness for both static and dynamic XANES measurements, improving data collection efficiency and enabling better time resolution for tracking chemical changes.

Through experiments on DenseNet-BC-100 with CIFAR- 100, EfficientNet-B0 with TinyImageNet and ResNet-34 with ImageNet-1K, we show that maintaining OUI within a prescribed interval correlates strongly with improved generalization and validation scores. Notably, OUI converges significantly faster than traditional metrics such as loss or accuracy, enabling practitioners to identify optimal WD (hyperparameter) values within the early stages of training. By leveraging OUI as a reliable indicator, we can determine early in training whether the chosen WD value leads the model to underfit the training data, overfit, or strike a well-balanced trade-off that maximizes validation scores.

    "summary": "The subcellular localization of RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and other smaller RNAs, plays a critical role in determining their biological functions. For instance, lncRNAs are predominantly associated with chromatin and act as regulators of gene transcription and chromatin structure, while mRNAs are distributed across the nucleus and cytoplasm, facilitating the transport of genetic information for protein synthesis. Understanding RNA localization sheds light on processes like gene expression regulation with spatial and temporal precision. However, traditional wet lab methods for determining RNA localization, such as in situ hybridization, are often time-consuming, resource-demanding, and costly. To overcome these challenges, computational methods leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as powerful alternatives, enabling large-scale prediction of RNA subcellular localization. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in AI-based approaches for RNA subcellular localization prediction, covering various RNA types and focusing on sequence-based, image-based, and hybrid methodologies that combine both data types. We highlight the potential of these methods to accelerate RNA research, uncover molecular pathways, and guide targeted disease treatments. Furthermore, we critically discuss the challenges in AI/ML approaches for RNA subcellular localization, such as data scarcity and lack of benchmarks, and opportunities to address them. This review aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to develop innovative solutions in the field of RNA subcellular localization and beyond.",

    "summary": "Unresolved questions about how autonomous vehicles (AVs) should meet the informational needs of riders hinder real-world adoption. Complicating our ability to satisfy rider needs is that different people, goals, and driving contexts have different criteria for what constitutes interaction success. Unfortunately, most human-AV research and design today treats all people and situations uniformly. It is crucial to understand how an AV should communicate to meet rider needs, and how communications should change when the human-AV complex system changes. I argue that understanding the relationships between different aspects of the human-AV system can help us build improved and adaptable AV communications. I support this argument using three empirical studies. First, I identify optimal communication strategies that enhance driving performance, confidence, and trust for learning in extreme driving environments. Findings highlight the need for task-sensitive, modality-appropriate communications tuned to learner cognitive limits and goals. Next, I highlight the consequences of deploying faulty communication systems and demonstrate the need for context-sensitive communications. Third, I use machine learning (ML) to illuminate personal factors predicting trust in AVs, emphasizing the importance of tailoring designs to individual traits and concerns. Together, this dissertation supports the necessity of transparent, adaptable, and personalized AV systems that cater to individual needs, goals, and contextual demands. By considering the complex system within which human-AV interactions occur, we can deliver valuable insights for designers, researchers, and policymakers. This dissertation also provides a concrete domain to study theories of human-machine joint action and situational awareness, and can be used to guide future human-AI interaction research.

    "summary": "Current text-to-video (T2V) generation models are increasingly popular due to their ability to produce coherent videos from textual prompts. However, these models often struggle to generate semantically and temporally consistent videos when dealing with longer, more complex prompts involving multiple objects or sequential events. Additionally, the high computational costs associated with training or fine-tuning make direct improvements impractical. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \\(\\projectname\\), a novel zero-training video refinement pipeline that leverages neuro-symbolic feedback to automatically enhance video generation, achieving superior alignment with the prompts. Our approach first derives the neuro-symbolic feedback by analyzing a formal video representation and pinpoints semantically inconsistent events, objects, and their corresponding frames. This feedback then guides targeted edits to the original video. Extensive empirical evaluations on both open-source and proprietary T2V models demonstrate that \\(\\projectname\\) significantly enhances temporal and logical alignment across diverse prompts by almost $40\\%$.",

To validate RuleLLM's effectiveness, we implemented a prototype system and conducted experiments on the dataset of 1,633 malicious packages. The results are promising that RuleLLM generated 763 rules (452 YARA and 311 Semgrep) with a precision of 85.2\\% and a recall of 91.8\\%, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) tools and scored-based approaches.

By incorporating auxiliary training and physics-informed loss functions, the proposed method ensures that the generated data exhibit both statistical fidelity and adherence to power system feasibility. We evaluate the approach on the IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus benchmark systems, demonstrating its ability to capture key distributional properties and generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios.

    "summary": "Even in the era of rapid advances in large models, video understanding, particularly long videos, remains highly challenging. Compared with textual or image-based information, videos commonly contain more information with redundancy, requiring large models to strategically allocate attention at a global level for accurate comprehension. To address this, we propose MCAF, an agent-based, training-free framework perform video understanding through Multimodal Coarse-to-fine Attention Focusing. The key innovation lies in its ability to sense and prioritize segments of the video that are highly relevant to the understanding task. First, MCAF hierarchically concentrates on highly relevant frames through multimodal information, enhancing the correlation between the acquired contextual information and the query. Second, it employs a dilated temporal expansion mechanism to mitigate the risk of missing crucial details when extracting information from these concentrated frames. In addition, our framework incorporates a self-reflection mechanism utilizing the confidence level of the model's responses as feedback. By iteratively applying these two creative focusing strategies, it adaptively adjusts attention to capture highly query-connected context and thus improves response accuracy. MCAF outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on average. On the EgoSchema dataset, it achieves a remarkable 5% performance gain over the leading approach. Meanwhile, on Next-QA and IntentQA datasets, it outperforms the current state-of-the-art standard by 0.2% and 0.3% respectively. On the Video-MME dataset, which features videos averaging nearly an hour in length, MCAF also outperforms other agent-based methods.",

Although adversarial training has been an established technique for enhancing robustness in predictive models, it has been overlooked for generative models due to concerns about potential fidelity degradation by the nature of trade-offs between performance and robustness. In this work, we challenge this presumption, introducing Smooth Robust Latent VAE (SRL-VAE), a novel adversarial training framework that boosts both generation quality and robustness. In contrast to conventional adversarial training, which focuses on robustness only, our approach smooths the latent space via adversarial perturbations, promoting more generalizable representations while regularizing with originality representation to sustain original fidelity. Applied as a post-training step on pre-trained VAEs, SRL-VAE improves image robustness and fidelity with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show that SRL-VAE improves both generation quality, in image reconstruction and text-guided image editing, and robustness, against Nightshade attacks and image editing attacks. These results establish a new paradigm, showing that adversarial training, once thought to be detrimental to generative models, can instead enhance both fidelity and robustness.",

Specifically, NeuralGrok trains an auxiliary module (e.g., an MLP block) in conjunction with the base model. This module dynamically modulates the influence of individual gradient components based on their contribution to generalization, guided by a bilevel optimization algorithm. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralGrok significantly accelerates generalization, particularly in challenging arithmetic tasks. We also show that NeuralGrok promotes a more stable training paradigm, constantly reducing the model's complexity, while traditional regularization methods, such as weight decay, can introduce substantial instability and impede generalization. We further investigate the intrinsic model complexity leveraging a novel Absolute Gradient Entropy (AGE) metric, which explains that NeuralGrok effectively facilitates generalization by reducing the model complexity. We offer valuable insights on the grokking phenomenon of Transformer models, which encourages a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles governing generalization ability.",

However, these embeddings are difficult to understand and integrate with external knowledge, limiting the effectiveness of applications such as customer segmentation, search navigation, and product recommendations. To address this, our paper introduces the concept of the customer persona. Condensed from a customer's numerous purchasing histories, a customer persona provides a multi-faceted and human-readable characterization of specific purchase behaviors and preferences, such as Busy Parents or Bargain Hunters.\nThis work then focuses on representing each customer by multiple personas from a predefined set, achieving readable and informative explicit user representations. To this end, we propose an effective and efficient solution GPLR. To ensure effectiveness, GPLR leverages pre-trained LLMs to infer personas for customers. To reduce overhead, GPLR applies LLM-based labeling to only a fraction of users and utilizes a random walk technique to predict personas for the remaining customers. We further propose RevAff, which provides an absolute error $\\epsilon$ guarantee while improving the time complexity of the exact solution by a factor of at least $O(\\frac{\\epsilon\\cdot|E|N}{|E|+N\\log N})$, where $N$ represents the number of customers and products, and $E$ represents the interactions between them. We evaluate the performance of our persona-based representation in terms of accuracy and robustness for recommendation and customer segmentation tasks using three real-world e-commerce datasets. Most notably, we find that integrating customer persona representations improves the state-of-the-art graph convolution-based recommendation model by up to 12% in terms of NDCG@K and F1-Score@K.",

    "summary": "We present FLUKE (Framework for LingUistically-driven and tasK-agnostic robustness Evaluation), a task-agnostic framework for assessing model robustness through systematic minimal variations of test data. FLUKE introduces controlled variations across linguistic levels - from orthography to dialect and style varieties - and leverages large language models (LLMs) with human validation to generate modifications. We demonstrate FLUKE's utility by evaluating both fine-tuned models and LLMs across four diverse NLP tasks, and reveal that (1) the impact of linguistic variations is highly task-dependent, with some tests being critical for certain tasks but irrelevant for others; (2) while LLMs have better overall robustness compared to fine-tuned models, they still exhibit significant brittleness to certain linguistic variations; (3) all models show substantial vulnerability to negation modifications across most tasks. These findings highlight the importance of systematic robustness testing for understanding model behaviors.",

In particular, hands-free locomotion offers a valuable alternative by supporting accessibility and freeing users from reliance on handheld controllers. To this end, traditional speech-based methods often depend on rigid command sets, limiting the naturalness and flexibility of interaction. In this study, we propose a novel locomotion technique powered by large language models (LLMs), which allows users to navigate virtual environments using natural language with contextual awareness. We evaluate three locomotion methods: controller-based teleportation, voice-based steering, and our language model-driven approach. Our evaluation measures include eye-tracking data analysis, including explainable machine learning through SHAP analysis as well as standardized questionnaires for usability, presence, cybersickness, and cognitive load to examine user attention and engagement. Our findings indicate that the LLM-driven locomotion possesses comparable usability, presence, and cybersickness scores to established methods like teleportation, demonstrating its novel potential as a comfortable, natural language-based, hands-free alternative. In addition, it enhances user attention within the virtual environment, suggesting greater engagement. Complementary to these findings, SHAP analysis revealed that fixation, saccade, and pupil-related features vary across techniques, indicating distinct patterns of visual attention and cognitive processing. Overall, we state that our method can facilitate hands-free locomotion in virtual spaces, especially in supporting accessibility.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces an enhanced Genetic Algorithm technique called Dual-Individual Genetic Algorithm (Dual-Individual GA), which optimizes neural networks for binary image classification tasks, such as cat vs. non-cat classification. The proposed method employs only two individuals for crossover, represented by two parameter sets: Leader and Follower. The Leader focuses on exploitation, representing the primary optimal solution at even-indexed positions (0, 2, 4, ...), while the Follower promotes exploration by preserving diversity and avoiding premature convergence, operating at odd-indexed positions (1, 3, 5, ...). Leader and Follower are modeled as two phases or roles. The key contributions of this work are threefold: (1) a self-adaptive layer dimension mechanism that eliminates the need for manual tuning of layer architectures; (2) generates two parameter sets, leader and follower parameter sets, with 10 layer architecture configurations (5 for each set), ranked by Pareto dominance and cost. post-optimization; and (3) demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional gradient-based methods. Experimental results show that the Dual-Individual GA achieves 99.04% training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.034) on a three-layer network with architecture [12288, 17, 4, 1], outperforming a gradient-based approach that achieves 98% training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.092) on a four-layer network with architecture [12288, 20, 7, 5, 1]. These findings highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing neural networks.",

    "summary": "The effective contact area in rough surface contact plays a critical role in multi-physics phenomena such as wear, sealing, and thermal or electrical conduction. Although accurate numerical methods, like the Boundary Element Method (BEM), are available to compute this quantity, their high computational cost limits their applicability in multi-query contexts, such as uncertainty quantification, parameter identification, and multi-scale algorithms, where many repeated evaluations are required. This study proposes a surrogate modeling framework for predicting the effective contact area using fast-to-evaluate data-driven techniques. Various machine learning algorithms are trained on a precomputed dataset, where the inputs are the imposed load and statistical roughness parameters, and the output is the corresponding effective contact area. All models undergo hyperparameter optimization to enable fair comparisons in terms of predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, evaluated using established quantitative metrics. Among the models, the Kernel Ridge Regressor demonstrates the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, achieving high predictive accuracy, low prediction time, and minimal training overhead-making it a strong candidate for general-purpose surrogate modeling. The Gaussian Process Regressor provides an attractive alternative when uncertainty quantification is required, although it incurs additional computational cost due to variance estimation. The generalization capability of the Kernel Ridge model is validated on an unseen simulation scenario, confirming its ability to transfer to new configurations. Database generation constitutes the dominant cost in the surrogate modeling process. Nevertheless, the approach proves practical and efficient for multi-query tasks, even when accounting for this initial expense.",

The framework's core innovation lies in an evolving interaction graph that models features as nodes and transformations as edges. Through graph pruning and backtracking, it dynamically eliminates low-impact edges, reduces redundant operations, and enhances exploration stability. This graph also provides full traceability to empower TCTO to reuse high-utility subgraphs from historical transformations. To demonstrate the efficacy and adaptability of our approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments and case studies, which show superior performance across a range of datasets.",

Although large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on existing benchmarks, these datasets fail to reflect the complexities of such texts, limiting their applicability to practical scenarios. To bridge this gap, we construct the first spoken long-text dataset, derived from live streams, designed to reflect the redundancy-rich and conversational nature of real-world scenarios. We construct tasks in three categories: retrieval-dependent, reasoning-dependent, and hybrid. We then evaluate both popular LLMs and specialized methods to assess their ability to understand long-contexts in these tasks. Our results show that current methods exhibit strong task-specific preferences and perform poorly on highly redundant inputs, with no single method consistently outperforming others. We propose a new baseline that better handles redundancy in spoken text and achieves strong performance across tasks. Our findings highlight key limitations of current methods and suggest future directions for improving long-context understanding. Finally, our benchmark fills a gap in evaluating long-context spoken language understanding and provides a practical foundation for developing real-world e-commerce systems.

To address this gap, this paper presents a complete framework that systematically explores the entire process of developing foundation models in conjunction with geophysical data. From data collection and preprocessing to model architecture selection, pre-training strategies, and model deployment, we provide a detailed analysis of the key techniques and methodologies at each stage. In particular, considering the diversity, complexity, and physical consistency constraints of geophysical data, we discuss targeted solutions to address these challenges. Furthermore, we discuss how to leverage the transfer learning capabilities of foundation models to reduce reliance on labeled data, enhance computational efficiency, and incorporate physical constraints into model training, thereby improving physical consistency and interpretability. Through a comprehensive summary and analysis of the current technological landscape, this paper not only fills the gap in the geophysics domain regarding a full-process review of foundation models but also offers valuable practical guidance for their application in geophysical data analysis, driving innovation and advancement in the field.",

Additionally, the system should satisfy requirements for scalability, accuracy, justification, trustworthiness and adaptability to be adopted in this domain. Participants also emphasised the importance of having end users review the input data that might be challenging for AI to interpret, and validate the generated output to ensure the system's accuracy. To keep up with the evolving nature of the law enforcement domain, end users need to help the system adapt to the changes in criminal behaviour and government guidance, and technical experts need to regularly oversee and monitor the system. Furthermore, user-friendly human interaction with the system is essential for its adoption and some of the participants confirmed they would be happy to be in the loop and provide necessary feedback that the system can learn from. Finally, we argue that it is very unlikely that the system will ever achieve full automation due to the dynamic and complex nature of the law enforcement domain.",

While current deep learning methods have made significant advancements, challenges remain in achieving an optimal balance between accuracy, robustness, and inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose the StereoMamba architecture, which is specifically designed for stereo disparity estimation in RAMIS. Our approach is based on a novel Feature Extraction Mamba (FE-Mamba) module, which enhances long-range spatial dependencies both within and across stereo images. To effectively integrate multi-scale features from FE-Mamba, we then introduce a novel Multidimensional Feature Fusion (MFF) module. Experiments against the state-of-the-art on the ex-vivo SCARED benchmark demonstrate that StereoMamba achieves superior performance on EPE of 2.64 px and depth MAE of 2.55 mm, the second-best performance on Bad2 of 41.49% and Bad3 of 26.99%, while maintaining an inference speed of 21.28 FPS for a pair of high-resolution images (1280*1024), striking the optimum balance between accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. Furthermore, by comparing synthesized right images, generated from warping left images using the generated disparity maps, with the actual right image, StereoMamba achieves the best average SSIM (0.8970) and PSNR (16.0761), exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization on the in-vivo RIS2017 and StereoMIS datasets.",

Pose estimation methods using Neural Networks (NN) based on an RGBD camera are highly accurate, but their accuracy significantly decreases when the camera acquires few texture and shape features at a current view point. However, it is difficult for previous mathematical model-based methods to estimate effective NV which is because the simple shaped objects have few shape features. Therefore, we focus on the relationship between the pose estimation and NV estimation. When the pose estimation is more accurate, the NV estimation is more accurate. Therefore, we develop a new pose estimation NN that estimates NV simultaneously. Experimental results showed that our NV estimation realized a pose estimation success rate 77.3\\%, which was 7.4pt higher than the mathematical model-based NV calculation did. Moreover, we verified that the robot using our method displayed 84.2\\% of products.",

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable program comprehension capabilities, while transformer-based topic modeling techniques offer effective ways to extract semantic information from text. This paper proposes and explores a novel approach that combines these strengths to automatically identify meaningful topics in a corpus of Python programs. Our method consists in applying topic modeling on the descriptions obtained by asking an LLM to summarize the code. To assess the internal consistency of the extracted topics, we compare them against topics inferred from function names alone, and those derived from existing docstrings. Experimental results suggest that leveraging LLM-generated summaries provides interpretable and semantically rich representation of code structure. The promising results suggest that our approach can be fruitfully applied in various software engineering tasks such as automatic documentation and tagging, code search, software reorganization and knowledge discovery in large repositories.",

    "summary": "Context: Previous research on software aging is limited with focus on dynamic runtime indicators like memory and performance, often neglecting evolutionary indicators like source code comments and narrowly examining legacy issues within the TD context. Objective: We introduce the concept of Aging Debt (AD), representing the increased maintenance efforts and costs needed to keep software updated. We study AD through Self-Admitted Aging Debt (SAAD) observed in source code comments left by software developers. Method: We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analyses to detect and measure AD in software. This includes framing SAAD patterns from the source code comments after analysing the source code context, then utilizing the SAAD patterns to detect SAAD comments. In the process, we develop a taxonomy for SAAD that reflects the temporal aging of software and its associated debt. Then we utilize the taxonomy to quantify the different types of AD prevalent in OSS repositories. Results: Our proposed taxonomy categorizes temporal software aging into Active and Dormant types. Our extensive analysis of over 9,000+ Open Source Software (OSS) repositories reveals that more than 21% repositories exhibit signs of SAAD as observed from our gold standard SAAD dataset. Notably, Dormant AD emerges as the predominant category, highlighting a critical but often overlooked aspect of software maintenance. Conclusion: As software volume grows annually, so do evolutionary aging and maintenance challenges; our proposed taxonomy can aid researchers in detailed software aging studies and help practitioners develop improved and proactive maintenance strategies.",

    "summary": "There has been impressive progress in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Recent works extend these models to long inputs, including multi-page documents and long videos. However, the model size and performance of these long context models are still limited due to the computational cost in both training and inference. In this work, we explore an orthogonal direction and process long inputs without long context LMMs. We propose Frame Selection Augmented Generation (FRAG), where the model first selects relevant frames within the input, and then only generates the final outputs based on the selected frames. The core of the selection process is done by scoring each frame independently, which does not require long context processing. The frames with the highest scores are then selected by a simple Top-K selection. We show that this frustratingly simple framework is applicable to both long videos and multi-page documents using existing LMMs without any fine-tuning. We consider two models, LLaVA-OneVision and InternVL2, in our experiments and show that FRAG consistently improves the performance and achieves state-of-the-art performances for both long video and long document understanding. For videos, FRAG substantially improves InternVL2-76B by 5.8% on MLVU and 3.7% on Video-MME. For documents, FRAG achieves over 20% improvements on MP-DocVQA compared with recent LMMs specialized in long document understanding. Code is available at: this https URL",

    "summary": "The significant computational demands of pretrained language models (PLMs), which often require dedicated hardware, present a substantial challenge in serving them efficiently, especially in multi-tenant environments. To address this, we introduce HMI, a Hierarchical knowledge management-based Multi-tenant Inference system, designed to manage tenants with distinct PLMs resource-efficiently. Our approach is three-fold: Firstly, we categorize PLM knowledge into general, domain-specific, and task-specific. Leveraging insights on knowledge acquisition across different model layers, we construct hierarchical PLMs (hPLMs) by extracting and storing knowledge at different levels, significantly reducing GPU memory usage per tenant. Secondly, we establish hierarchical knowledge management for hPLMs generated by various tenants in HMI. We manage domain-specific knowledge with acceptable storage increases by constructing and updating domain-specific knowledge trees based on frequency. We manage task-specific knowledge within limited GPU memory through parameter swapping. Finally, we propose system optimizations to enhance resource utilization and inference throughput. These include fine-grained pipelining via hierarchical knowledge prefetching to overlap CPU and I/O operations with GPU computations, and optimizing parallel implementations with batched matrix multiplications. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HMI can efficiently serve up to 10,000 hPLMs (hBERTs and hGPTs) on a single GPU, with only a negligible compromise in accuracy.",

    "summary": "Climate change increases the frequency of extreme rainfall, placing a significant strain on urban infrastructures, especially Combined Sewer Systems (CSS). Overflows from overburdened CSS release untreated wastewater into surface waters, posing environmental and public health risks. Although traditional physics-based models are effective, they are costly to maintain and difficult to adapt to evolving system dynamics. Machine Learning (ML) approaches offer cost-efficient alternatives with greater adaptability. To systematically assess the potential of ML for modeling urban infrastructure systems, we propose a protocol for evaluating Neural Network architectures for CSS time series forecasting with respect to predictive performance, model complexity, and robustness to perturbations. In addition, we assess model performance on peak events and critical fluctuations, as these are the key regimes for urban wastewater management. To investigate the feasibility of lightweight models suitable for IoT deployment, we compare global models, which have access to all information, with local models, which rely solely on nearby sensor readings. Additionally, to explore the security risks posed by network outages or adversarial attacks on urban infrastructure, we introduce error models that assess the resilience of models. Our results demonstrate that while global models achieve higher predictive performance, local models provide sufficient resilience in decentralized scenarios, ensuring robust modeling of urban infrastructure. Furthermore, models with longer native forecast horizons exhibit greater robustness to data perturbations. These findings contribute to the development of interpretable and reliable ML solutions for sustainable urban wastewater management. The implementation is available in our GitHub repository.",

    "summary": "Gossip Learning (GL) is a decentralized learning paradigm where users iteratively exchange and aggregate models with a small set of neighboring peers. Recent GL approaches rely on dynamic communication graphs built and maintained using Random Peer Sampling (RPS) protocols. Thanks to graph dynamics, GL can achieve fast convergence even over extremely sparse topologies. However, the robustness of GL over dy- namic graphs to Byzantine (model poisoning) attacks remains unaddressed especially when Byzantine nodes attack the RPS protocol to scale up model poisoning. We address this issue by introducing GRANITE, a framework for robust learning over sparse, dynamic graphs in the presence of a fraction of Byzantine nodes. GRANITE relies on two key components (i) a History-aware Byzantine-resilient Peer Sampling protocol (HaPS), which tracks previously encountered identifiers to reduce adversarial influence over time, and (ii) an Adaptive Probabilistic Threshold (APT), which leverages an estimate of Byzantine presence to set aggregation thresholds with formal guarantees. Empirical results confirm that GRANITE maintains convergence with up to 30% Byzantine nodes, improves learning speed via adaptive filtering of poisoned models and obtains these results in up to 9 times sparser graphs than dictated by current theory.",

    "summary": "We propose a novel sample selection method for image classification in the presence of noisy labels. Existing methods typically consider small-loss samples as correctly labeled. However, some correctly labeled samples are inherently difficult for the model to learn and can exhibit high loss similar to mislabeled samples in the early stages of training. Consequently, setting a threshold on per-sample loss to select correct labels results in a trade-off between precision and recall in sample selection: a lower threshold may miss many correctly labeled hard-to-learn samples (low recall), while a higher threshold may include many mislabeled samples (low precision). To address this issue, our goal is to accurately distinguish correctly labeled yet hard-to-learn samples from mislabeled ones, thus alleviating the trade-off dilemma. We achieve this by considering the trends in model prediction confidence rather than relying solely on loss values. Empirical observations show that only for correctly labeled samples, the model's prediction confidence for the annotated labels typically increases faster than for any other classes. Based on this insight, we propose tracking the confidence gaps between the annotated labels and other classes during training and evaluating their trends using the Mann-Kendall Test. A sample is considered potentially correctly labeled if all its confidence gaps tend to increase. Our method functions as a plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing sample selection techniques. Experiments on several standard benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of existing methods for learning with noisy labels.",

Unlike previous methods that fix these ranges beforehand, our training approach breaks down predictions over the entire signal range into smaller segments, which are then dynamically weighted and combined to produce accurate forecasts. We tested our method on standard datasets, including a new dataset from wireless communication, and found that not only it improves prediction accuracy but also improves the performance of end application employing the forecasting model.

    "summary": "Virtual screening plays a critical role in modern drug discovery by enabling the identification of promising candidate molecules for experimental validation. Traditional machine learning methods such as support vector machines (SVM) and XGBoost rely on predefined molecular representations, often leading to information loss and potential bias. In contrast, deep learning approaches-particularly Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)-offer a more expressive and unbiased alternative by operating directly on molecular graphs. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in drug design, thanks to their capacity to capture complex chemical patterns from large-scale data via attention mechanisms.\nIn this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that integrates GCNs with LLM-derived embeddings to combine localized structural learning with global chemical knowledge. The LLM embeddings can be precomputed and stored in a molecular feature library, removing the need to rerun the LLM during training or inference and thus maintaining computational efficiency. We found that concatenating the LLM embeddings after each GCN layer-rather than only at the final layer-significantly improves performance, enabling deeper integration of global context throughout the network. The resulting model achieves superior results, with an F1-score of (88.8%), outperforming standalone GCN (87.9%), XGBoost (85.5%), and SVM (85.4%) baselines.",

Prior works have proposed various methods to mitigate this statistical heterogeneity. While these works can achieve good theoretical performance, in this work we provide the first investigation into a hidden over-correction phenomenon brought by the uniform model correction coefficients across clients adopted by existing methods. Such over-correction could degrade model performance and even cause failures in model convergence. To address this, we propose TACO, a novel algorithm that addresses the non-IID nature of clients' data by implementing fine-grained, client-specific gradient correction and model aggregation, steering local models towards a more accurate global optimum. Moreover, we verify that leading FL algorithms generally have better model accuracy in terms of communication rounds rather than wall-clock time, resulting from their extra computation overhead imposed on clients. To enhance the training efficiency, TACO deploys a lightweight model correction and tailored aggregation approach that requires minimum computation overhead and no extra information beyond the synchronized model parameters. To validate TACO's effectiveness, we present the first FL convergence analysis that reveals the root cause of over-correction. Extensive experiments across various datasets confirm TACO's superior and stable performance in practice.",

Designing suitable feature spaces for neural network-based motion planers that encapsulate all kinds of road scenarios is still an open research challenge.

So that only easy images are selected for training when the model has poor fitting ability at the initial stage, and gradually expand to more difficult images, the strategy includes a difficulty evaluation strategy based on the teacher model and an knee point-based training scheduling strategy. Firstly, multiple teacher models are trained, and the consistency of the quality of steganographic images under multiple teacher models is used as the difficulty score to construct the training subsets from easy to difficult. Secondly, a training control strategy based on knee points is proposed to reduce the possibility of overfitting on small training sets and accelerate the training process. Experimental results on three large public datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, show that the proposed image steganography scheme is able to improve the model performance under multiple algorithmic frameworks, which not only has a high PSNR, SSIM score, and decoding accuracy, but also the steganographic images generated by the model under the training of the STCL strategy have a low steganography analysis scores.

    "summary": "Time series classification (TSC) is a critical task with applications in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Due to privacy concerns and data regulations, Federated Learning has emerged as a promising approach for learning from distributed time series data without centralizing raw information. However, most FL solutions rely on a client-server architecture, which introduces robustness and confidentiality risks related to the distinguished role of the server, which is a single point of failure and can observe knowledge extracted from clients. To address these challenges, we propose DROCKS, a fully decentralized FL framework for TSC that leverages ROCKET (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) features. In DROCKS, the global model is trained by sequentially traversing a structured path across federation nodes, where each node refines the model and selects the most effective local kernels before passing them to the successor. Extensive experiments on the UCR archive demonstrate that DROCKS outperforms state-of-the-art client-server FL approaches while being more resilient to node failures and malicious attacks.

Recent studies suggest that promoting \\{beta}-arrestin-biased signaling in NTSR1 may diminish drugs of abuse, such as psychostimulants, thereby offering a potential avenue for treating human addiction-related disorders. In this study, we utilized a novel computational and experimental approach that combined nudged elastic band-based molecular dynamics simulations, Markov state models, temporal communication network analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and conformational biosensors, to explore the intricate mechanisms underlying NTSR1 activation and biased signaling. Our study reveals a dynamic stepwise transition mechanism and activated transmission network associated with NTSR1 activation. It also yields valuable insights into the complex interplay between the unique polar network, non-conserved ion locks, and aromatic clusters in NTSR1 signaling. Moreover, we identified a cryptic allosteric site located in the intracellular region of the receptor that exists in an intermediate state within the activation pathway. Collectively, these findings contribute to a more profound understanding of NTSR1 activation and biased signaling at the atomic level, thereby providing a potential strategy for the development of NTSR1 allosteric modulators in the realm of G protein-coupled receptor biology, biophysics, and medicine.",

    "summary": "Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like financial transactions and academic collaborations. In such systems, dynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node classification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp. However, it is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to high annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels in fraud detection). In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain as they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a unique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history data. To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum Learning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node classification where only final labels are available. PTCL introduces: (1) a temporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware representations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which generate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that prioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them higher weights using an exponentially decaying function. We contribute a new academic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic graph. Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent superiority over other methods adapted to this task. Beyond methodology, we propose a unified framework FLiD (Framework for Label-Limited Dynamic Node Classification), consisting of a complete preparation workflow, training pipeline, and evaluation standards, and supporting various models and datasets.

    "summary": "This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of conformal prediction methods on a challenging aerial image dataset featuring diverse events in unconstrained environments. Conformal prediction is a powerful post-hoc technique that takes the output of any classifier and transforms it into a set of likely labels, providing a statistical guarantee on the coverage of the true label. Unlike evaluations on standard benchmarks, our study addresses the complexities of data-scarce and highly variable real-world settings. We investigate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained models (MobileNet, DenseNet, and ResNet), fine-tuned with limited labeled data, to generate informative prediction sets. To further evaluate the impact of calibration, we consider two parallel pipelines (with and without temperature scaling) and assess performance using two key metrics: empirical coverage and average prediction set size. This setup allows us to systematically examine how calibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and simple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable uncertainty estimates for complex tasks. Moreover, our analysis reveals that while temperature scaling is often employed for calibration, it does not consistently lead to smaller prediction sets, underscoring the importance of careful consideration in its application. Furthermore, our results highlight the significant potential of model compression techniques within the conformal prediction pipeline for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Based on our observations, we advocate for future research to delve into the impact of noisy or ambiguous labels on conformal prediction performance and to explore effective model reduction strategies.",

While LVLMs excel in multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under user-defined risk levels ($\\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous control of \\textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain strictly below $\\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes inversely with $\\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces theoretical guarantees across all $\\alpha$ values. The framework achieves stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios, underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems, offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware decision-making.",

This study proposes an interpretable Machine Learning (ML) framework for MDR prediction, aiming for both accurate inference and enhanced explainability.\nMethods: Patients are modeled as Multivariate Time Series (MTS), capturing clinical progression and patient-to-patient interactions. Similarity among patients is quantified using MTS-based methods: descriptive statistics, Dynamic Time Warping, and Time Cluster Kernel. These similarity measures serve as inputs for MDR classification via Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, with dimensionality reduction and kernel transformations improving model performance. For explainability, patient similarity networks are constructed from these metrics. Spectral clustering and t-SNE are applied to identify MDR-related subgroups and visualize high-risk clusters, enabling insight into clinically relevant patterns.\nResults: The framework was validated on ICU Electronic Health Records from the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada, achieving an AUC of 81%. It outperforms baseline ML and deep learning models by leveraging graph-based patient similarity. The approach identifies key risk factors -- prolonged antibiotic use, invasive procedures, co-infections, and extended ICU stays -- and reveals clinically meaningful clusters.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in educational settings. These applications expand beyond English, though current LLMs remain primarily English-centric. In this work, we ascertain if their use in education settings in non-English languages is warranted. We evaluated the performance of popular LLMs on four educational tasks: identifying student misconceptions, providing targeted feedback, interactive tutoring, and grading translations in six languages (Hindi, Arabic, Farsi, Telugu, Ukrainian, Czech) in addition to English. We find that the performance on these tasks somewhat corresponds to the amount of language represented in training data, with lower-resource languages having poorer task performance. Although the models perform reasonably well in most languages, the frequent performance drop from English is significant. Thus, we recommend that practitioners first verify that the LLM works well in the target language for their educational task before deployment.",

    "summary": "In industrial settings, surface defects on steel can significantly compromise its service life and elevate potential safety risks. Traditional defect detection methods predominantly rely on manual inspection, which suffers from low efficiency and high costs. Although automated defect detection approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks(e.g., Mask R-CNN) have advanced rapidly, their reliability remains challenged due to data annotation uncertainties during deep model training and overfitting issues. These limitations may lead to detection deviations when processing the given new test samples, rendering automated detection processes unreliable. To address this challenge, we first evaluate the detection model's practical performance through calibration data that satisfies the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) condition with test data. Specifically, we define a loss function for each calibration sample to quantify detection error rates, such as the complement of recall rate and false discovery rate. Subsequently, we derive a statistically rigorous threshold based on a user-defined risk level to identify high-probability defective pixels in test images, thereby constructing prediction sets (e.g., defect regions). This methodology ensures that the expected error rate (mean error rate) on the test set remains strictly bounced by the predefined risk level. Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between the average prediction set size and the risk level on the test set, establishing a statistically rigorous metric for assessing detection model uncertainty. Furthermore, our study demonstrates robust and efficient control over the expected test set error rate across varying calibration-to-test partitioning ratios, validating the method's adaptability and operational effectiveness.",

The downside of this approach is the necessity for suitable symbolic representations describing the state of the environment as well as the actions that can change it. Traditionally such representations are carefully hand-designed by experts for distinct problem domains, which limits their transferability to different problems and environment complexities. In this paper, we propose a novel concept to generalize symbolic actions using a given entity hierarchy and observed similar behavior. In a simulated grid-based kitchen environment, we show that type-generalized actions can be learned from few observations and generalize to novel situations. Incorporating an additional on-the-fly generalization mechanism during planning, unseen task combinations, involving longer sequences, novel entities and unexpected environment behavior, can be solved.",

However, for planning tasks with limited prior data (e.g., blocks world, advanced travel planning), the performance of LLMs, including proprietary models like GPT and Gemini, is poor. This paper investigates the impact of fine-tuning on the planning capabilities of LLMs, revealing that LLMs can achieve strong performance in planning through substantial (tens of thousands of specific examples) fine-tuning. Yet, this process incurs high economic, time, and computational costs for each planning problem variation. To address this, we propose Clustering-Based Maximum Diversity Sampling (CMDS), which selects diverse and representative data to enhance sample efficiency and the model's generalization capability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CMDS-l, a baseline method combining CMDS with language embeddings, outperforms random sampling. Furthermore, we introduce a novel algorithm, CMDS-g, which encodes planning task instances with their graph representations into the embedding space. Empirical results show that CMDS-g consistently outperforms baseline methods across various scales and multiple benchmark domains.",

However, in many real-world applications, particularly in medical and low-resource domains, collecting large datasets is challenging due to resource constraints, which leads to overfitting and poor generalization. This study introduces FICAug, a novel feature-to-image data augmentation framework designed to improve model generalization under limited data conditions by generating structured synthetic samples.\nFICAug first operates in the feature space, where original data are clustered using the k-means algorithm. Within pure-label clusters, synthetic data are generated through Gaussian sampling to increase diversity while maintaining label consistency. These synthetic features are then projected back into the image domain using a generative neural network, and a convolutional neural network is trained on the reconstructed images to learn enhanced representations.\nExperimental results demonstrate that FICAug significantly improves classification accuracy. In feature space, it achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 84.09%, while training a ResNet-18 model on the reconstructed images further boosted performance to 88.63%, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework in extracting new and task-relevant features.",

Our approach leverages simple yet powerful preprocessing techniques, including regular expressions (regex) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to extract and highlight critical information from clinical notes. By pre-filtering long, unstructured text, we enhance the performance of smaller LLMs on EHR-related tasks. Our framework is evaluated using zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms on both private and publicly available datasets (MIMIC-IV), with additional comparisons against fine-tuned LLMs on MIMIC-IV. Experimental results demonstrate that our preprocessing strategy significantly supercharges the performance of smaller LLMs, making them well-suited for privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained applications. This study offers valuable insights into optimizing LLM performance for local, secure, and efficient healthcare applications. It provides practical guidance for real-world deployment for LLMs while tackling challenges related to privacy, computational feasibility, and clinical applicability.",

To address this problem, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach called neural DNF-MT for end-to-end policy learning. The differentiable nature of the neural DNF-MT model enables the use of deep actor-critic algorithms for training. At the same time, its architecture is designed so that trained models can be directly translated into interpretable policies expressed as standard (bivalent or probabilistic) logic programs. Moreover, additional layers can be included to extract abstract features from complex observations, acting as a form of predicate invention. The logic representations are highly interpretable, and we show how the bivalent representations of deterministic policies can be edited and incorporated back into a neural model, facilitating manual intervention and adaptation of learned policies. We evaluate our approach on a range of tasks requiring learning deterministic or stochastic behaviours from various forms of observations. Our empirical results show that our neural DNF-MT model performs at the level of competing black-box methods whilst providing interpretable policies.",

In this paper, we introduce a synthetic learning task, \"FTCT\" (Fragmented at Training, Chained at Testing), to validate the potential of Transformers in replicating this skill and interpret its inner mechanism. In the training phase, data consist of separated knowledge fragments from an overall causal graph. During testing, Transformers must infer complete causal graph traces by integrating these fragments. Our findings demonstrate that few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting enables Transformers to perform compositional reasoning on FTCT by revealing correct combinations of fragments, even if such combinations were absent in the training data. Furthermore, the emergence of compositional reasoning ability is strongly correlated with the model complexity and training-testing data similarity. We propose, both theoretically and empirically, that Transformers learn an underlying generalizable program from training, enabling effective compositional reasoning during testing.",

The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark plays a crucial role in evaluating these capabilities by testing how well AI models generalize to novel problems. While GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance by solving all ARC tasks under zero-noise conditions, other models like DeepSeek R1 and LLaMA 3.2 fail to solve any, suggesting limitations in their ability to reason beyond simple pattern matching. To explore this gap, we systematically evaluate these models across different noise levels and temperature settings. Our results reveal that the introduction of noise consistently impairs model performance, regardless of architecture. This decline highlights a shared vulnerability: current LLMs, despite showing signs of abstract reasoning, remain highly sensitive to input perturbations. Such fragility raises concerns about their real-world applicability, where noise and uncertainty are common. By comparing how different model architectures respond to these challenges, we offer insights into the structural weaknesses of modern LLMs in reasoning tasks. This work underscores the need for developing more robust and adaptable AI systems capable of handling the ambiguity and variability inherent in real-world scenarios. Our findings aim to guide future research toward enhancing model generalization, robustness, and alignment with human-like cognitive flexibility.",

In this paper, we consider explicitly modeling the generation process of states with the causal graphical model, based on which we augment the policy. We formulate the causal structure updating into the RL interaction process with active intervention learning of the environment. To optimize the derived objective, we propose a framework with theoretical performance guarantees that alternates between two steps: using interventions for causal structure learning during exploration and using the learned causal structure for policy guidance during exploitation. Due to the lack of public benchmarks that allow direct intervention in the state space, we design the root cause localization task in our simulated fault alarm environment and then empirically show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method against state-of-the-art baselines. Theoretical analysis shows that our performance improvement attributes to the virtuous cycle of causal-guided policy learning and causal structure learning, which aligns with our experimental results.

    "summary": "The traditional two-stage approach to causal inference first identifies a single causal model (or equivalence class of models), which is then used to answer causal queries. However, this neglects any epistemic model uncertainty. In contrast, Bayesian causal inference does incorporate epistemic uncertainty into query estimates via Bayesian marginalisation (posterior averaging) over all causal models. While principled, this marginalisation over entire causal models, i.e., both causal structures (graphs) and mechanisms, poses a tremendous computational challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by decomposing structure marginalisation into the marginalisation over (i) causal orders and (ii) directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) given an order. We can marginalise the latter in closed form by limiting the number of parents per variable and utilising Gaussian processes to model mechanisms. To marginalise over orders, we use a sampling-based approximation, for which we devise a novel auto-regressive distribution over causal orders (ARCO). Our method outperforms state-of-the-art in structure learning on simulated non-linear additive noise benchmarks, and yields competitive results on real-world data. Furthermore, we can accurately infer interventional distributions and average causal effects.",

This problem is important for many applications, such as oncology, for analyzing immune-tumor relationships and designing new immunotherapies. It is challenging due to spatial variability and interpretability needs. Previously proposed techniques require dense training data or have limited ability to handle significant spatial variability within a single place-type. Most importantly, these deep neural network (DNN) approaches are not designed to work in non-Euclidean space, particularly point sets. Existing non-Euclidean DNN methods are limited to one-size-fits-all approaches. We explore a spatial ensemble framework that explicitly uses different training strategies, including weighted-distance learning rate and spatial domain adaptation, on various place-types for spatially-lucid classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets (e.g., MxIF oncology data) show that the proposed framework provides higher prediction accuracy than baseline methods.",

With the growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical imaging, the development and evaluation of robust AI models require access to large, well-annotated datasets. In this study, we introduce the utility of Duke Lung Cancer Screening (DLCS) Dataset, the largest open-access LDCT dataset with over 2,000 scans and 3,000 expert-verified nodules. We benchmark deep learning models for both 3D nodule detection and lung cancer classification across internal and external datasets including LUNA16, LUNA25, and NLST-3D+. For detection, we develop two MONAI-based RetinaNet models (DLCSDmD and LUNA16-mD), evaluated using the Competition Performance Metric (CPM). For classification, we compare five models, including state-of-the-art pretrained models (Models Genesis, Med3D), a selfsupervised foundation model (FMCB), a randomly initialized ResNet50, and proposed a novel Strategic Warm-Start++ (SWS++) model. SWS++ uses curated candidate patches to pretrain a classification backbone within the same detection pipeline, enabling task-relevant feature learning. Our models demonstrated strong generalizability, with SWS++ achieving comparable or superior performance to existing foundational models across multiple datasets (AUC: 0.71 to 0.90). All code, models, and data are publicly released to promote reproducibility and collaboration. This work establishes a standardized benchmarking resource for lung cancer AI research, supporting future efforts in model development, validation, and clinical translation.",

    "summary": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) policies are highly susceptible to adversarial noise in observations, which poses significant risks in safety-critical scenarios. The challenge inherent to adversarial perturbations is that by altering the information observed by the agent, the state becomes only partially observable. Existing approaches address this by either enforcing consistent actions across nearby states or maximizing the worst-case value within adversarially perturbed observations. However, the former suffers from performance degradation when attacks succeed, while the latter tends to be overly conservative, leading to suboptimal performance in benign settings. We hypothesize that these limitations stem from their failing to account for partial observability directly. To this end, we introduce a novel objective called Adversarial Counterfactual Error (ACoE), defined on the beliefs about the true state and balancing value optimization with robustness. To make ACoE scalable in model-free settings, we propose the theoretically-grounded surrogate objective Cumulative-ACoE (C-ACoE). Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks (MuJoCo, Atari, and Highway) demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches for addressing adversarial RL challenges, offering a promising direction for improving robustness in DRL under adversarial conditions.

Although reviews have been conducted on this topic, there is a lack of comprehensive work detailing the challenges of dialogue summarization, unifying the differing understanding of the task, and aligning proposed techniques, datasets, and evaluation metrics with the challenges. This article summarizes the research on Transformer-based abstractive summarization for English dialogues by systematically reviewing 1262 unique research papers published between 2019 and 2024, relying on the Semantic Scholar and DBLP databases. We cover the main challenges present in dialog summarization (i.e., language, structure, comprehension, speaker, salience, and factuality) and link them to corresponding techniques such as graph-based approaches, additional training tasks, and planning strategies, which typically overly rely on BART-based encoder-decoder models. We find that while some challenges, like language, have seen considerable progress, mainly due to training methods, others, such as comprehension, factuality, and salience, remain difficult and hold significant research opportunities. We investigate how these approaches are typically assessed, covering the datasets for the subdomains of dialogue (e.g., meeting, medical), the established automatic metrics and human evaluation approaches for assessing scores and annotator agreement. We observe that only a few datasets span across all subdomains. The ROUGE metric is the most used, while human evaluation is frequently reported without sufficient detail on inner-annotator agreement and annotation guidelines. Additionally, we discuss the possible implications of the recently explored large language models and conclude that despite a potential shift in relevance and difficulty, our described challenge taxonomy remains relevant.",

Nevertheless, most of them cannot perform well in more complicated datasets like LOL-v2 while consuming too much computational resources. Besides, some of these methods require sophisticated training at different stages, making the procedure even more time-consuming and tedious. In this paper, we propose a more accurate, concise, and one-stage Retinex theory based framework, RSEND. RSEND first divides the low-light image into the illumination map and reflectance map, then captures the important details in the illumination map and performs light enhancement. After this step, it refines the enhanced gray-scale image and does element-wise matrix multiplication with the reflectance map. By denoising the output it has from the previous step, it obtains the final result. In all the steps, RSEND utilizes Squeeze and Excitation network to better capture the details. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our Efficient Retinex model significantly outperforms other CNN-based models, achieving a PSNR improvement ranging from 0.44 dB to 4.2 dB in different datasets and even outperforms transformer-based models in the LOL-v2-real dataset.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for empowering large language model (LLM) applications. Compared with the supervised training process of LLMs, the RLHF training process is much more sophisticated, requiring a diverse range of computation workloads with intricate dependencies between multiple LLM instances. Therefore, simply adopting the fixed parallelization strategies from supervised training for LLMs can be insufficient for RLHF and result in low training efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel technique named parameter ReaLlocation, which dynamically adapts the parallelization strategies for different workloads during training by redistributing LLM parameters across the training cluster. Building upon this idea, we introduce ReaL, a pioneering system for efficient RLHF training. ReaL introduces the concept of an execution plan, which defines a fine-grained resource allocation and parallelization strategy particularly designed for RLHF training. Based on this concept, ReaL employs a tailored search algorithm with a lightweight run-time estimator to automatically discover an efficient execution plan for an instance of RLHF experiment. Subsequently, the runtime engine deploys the selected plan by effectively parallelizing computations and redistributing parameters. We evaluate ReaL on the LLaMA models with up to 70 billion parameters and 128 GPUs. The experimental results demonstrate that ReaL achieves speedups of up to $3.58\\times$ compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, the execution plans generated by ReaL exhibit an average of $81\\%$ performance improvement over heuristic approaches based on Megatron-LM in the long-context scenario.

For time-dependent PDEs, many approaches are Markovian -- the evolution of the trained system only depends on the current state, and not the past states. In this work, we investigate the benefits of using memory for modeling time-dependent PDEs: that is, when past states are explicitly used to predict the future. Motivated by the Mori-Zwanzig theory of model reduction, we theoretically exhibit examples of simple (even linear) PDEs, in which a solution that uses memory is arbitrarily better than a Markovian solution. Additionally, we introduce Memory Neural Operator (MemNO), a neural operator architecture that combines recent state space models (specifically, S4) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) to effectively model memory. We empirically demonstrate that when the PDEs are supplied in low resolution or contain observation noise at train and test time, MemNO significantly outperforms the baselines without memory -- with up to 6x reduction in test error. Furthermore, we show that this benefit is particularly pronounced when the PDE solutions have significant high-frequency Fourier modes (e.g., low-viscosity fluid dynamics) and we construct a challenging benchmark dataset consisting of such PDEs.",

GPT-4-turbo with RAG outperformed the best non-RAG system by 33.5% in factor retrieval and showed 132% and 100% improvements in question-level and lab-level performance, respectively, for normal range retrieval. These findings highlight Lab-AI's potential to enhance patient understanding of lab results.",

In nGPT, all vectors forming the embeddings, MLP, attention matrices and hidden states are unit norm normalized. The input stream of tokens travels on the surface of a hypersphere, with each layer contributing a displacement towards the target output predictions. These displacements are defined by the MLP and attention blocks, whose vector components also reside on the same hypersphere. Experiments show that nGPT learns much faster, reducing the number of training steps required to achieve the same accuracy by a factor of 4 to 20, depending on the sequence length.",

We introduce Selective Attention, a simple parameter-free change to the standard attention mechanism which reduces attention to unneeded elements. Selective attention consistently improves language modeling and downstream task performance in a variety of model sizes and context lengths. For example, transformers trained with the language modeling objective on C4 with selective attention perform language modeling equivalently to standard transformers with ~2X more heads and parameters in their attention modules. Selective attention also allows decreasing the size of the attention's context buffer, leading to meaningful reductions in the memory and compute requirements during inference. For example, transformers trained on C4 with context sizes of 512, 1,024, and 2,048 need 16X, 25X, and 47X less memory for their attention module, respectively, when equipped with selective attention, as those without selective attention, with the same validation perplexity.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success at tasks like summarization that involve a single turn of interaction. However, they can still struggle with multi-turn tasks like dialogue that require long-term planning. Previous works on multi-turn dialogue extend single-turn reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods to the multi-turn setting by treating all prior dialogue turns as a long context. Such approaches suffer from covariate shift: the conversations in the training set have previous turns generated by some reference policy, which means that low training error may not necessarily correspond to good performance when the learner is actually in the conversation loop. In response, we introduce REgressing the RELative FUture (REFUEL), an efficient policy optimization approach designed to address multi-turn RLHF in LLMs. REFUEL employs a single model to estimate $Q$-values and trains on self-generated data, addressing the covariate shift issue. REFUEL frames the multi-turn RLHF problem as a sequence of regression tasks on iteratively collected datasets, enabling ease of implementation. Theoretically, we prove that REFUEL can match the performance of any policy covered by the training set. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm by using Llama-3.1-70B-it to simulate a user in conversation with our model. REFUEL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as DPO and REBEL across various settings. Furthermore, despite having only 8 billion parameters, Llama-3-8B-it fine-tuned with REFUEL outperforms Llama-3.1-70B-it on long multi-turn dialogues. Implementation of REFUEL can be found at this https URL, and models trained by REFUEL can be found at this https URL.",

This study presents a post-hoc analysis of microtargeting practices within climate campaigns by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to examine Facebook advertisements. Our analysis focuses on two key aspects: demographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age group, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.55%. Furthermore, we instruct the LLMs to generate explanations for their classifications, providing transparent reasoning behind each decision. These explanations reveal the specific thematic elements used to engage different demographic segments, highlighting distinct strategies tailored to various audiences. Our findings show that young adults are primarily targeted through messages emphasizing activism and environmental consciousness, while women are engaged through themes related to caregiving roles and social advocacy. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting microtargeted messaging, we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis to identify potential biases in model predictions. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist, particularly in the classification of senior citizens and male audiences. By showcasing the efficacy of LLMs in dissecting and explaining targeted communication strategies and by highlighting fairness concerns, this study provides a valuable framework for future research aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in social media-driven climate campaigns.",

    "summary": "The large models, as predicted by scaling raw forecasts, have made groundbreaking progress in many fields, particularly in natural language generation tasks, where they have approached or even surpassed human levels. However, the unprecedented scale of their parameters brings significant computational and storage costs. These large models require substantial computational resources and GPU memory to operate. When adapting large models to specific downstream tasks, their massive parameter scale poses a significant challenge in fine-tuning on hardware platforms with limited computational power and GPU memory. To address this issue, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) offers a practical solution by efficiently adjusting the parameters of large pre-trained models to suit various downstream tasks. Specifically, PEFT adjusts the parameters of pre-trained large models to adapt to specific tasks or domains, minimizing the introduction of additional parameters and the computational resources required. This review mainly introduces the preliminary knowledge of PEFT, the core ideas and principles of various PEFT algorithms, the applications of PEFT, and potential future research directions. By reading this review, we believe that interested parties can quickly grasp the PEFT methodology, thereby accelerating its development and innovation.",

    "summary": "Extending Bayesian optimization to batch evaluation can enable the designer to make the most use of parallel computing technology. However, most of current batch approaches do not scale well with the batch size. That is, their performances deteriorate dramatically as the batch size increases. To address this issue, we propose a simple and efficient approach to extend Bayesian optimization to large-scale batch evaluation in this work. Different from existing batch approaches, the idea of the new approach is to draw a batch of axis-aligned subspaces of the original problem and select one acquisition point from each subspace. To achieve this, we propose the expected subspace improvement criterion to measure the amount of the improvement that a candidate point can achieve within a certain axis-aligned subspace. By optimizing these expected subspace improvement functions simultaneously, we can get a batch of query points for parallel evaluation. Numerical experiments show that our proposed approach can speedup the convergence significantly when compared with the sequential Bayesian optimization algorithm, and performs very competitively when compared with seven batch Bayesian optimization algorithms. A Matlab implementation of the proposed approach is available at this https URL.",

As these models become prevalent, various metrics and benchmarks have emerged to evaluate the quality of the generated videos. However, these metrics emphasize visual quality and smoothness, neglecting temporal fidelity and text-to-video alignment, which are crucial for safety-critical applications. To address this gap, we introduce NeuS-V, a novel synthetic video evaluation metric that rigorously assesses text-to-video alignment using neuro-symbolic formal verification techniques. Our approach first converts the prompt into a formally defined Temporal Logic (TL) specification and translates the generated video into an automaton representation. Then, it evaluates the text-to-video alignment by formally checking the video automaton against the TL specification. Furthermore, we present a dataset of temporally extended prompts to evaluate state-of-the-art video generation models against our benchmark. We find that NeuS-V demonstrates a higher correlation by over 5x with human evaluations when compared to existing metrics. Our evaluation further reveals that current video generation models perform poorly on these temporally complex prompts, highlighting the need for future work in improving text-to-video generation capabilities.",

    "summary": "This research aims to know traffic anomalies as early as possible. A traffic anomaly refers to a generic incident on the road that influences traffic flow and calls for urgent traffic management measures. `Knowing'' the occurrence of a traffic anomaly is twofold: the ability to detect this anomaly before it is reported anywhere, or it may be such that an anomaly can be predicted before it actually occurs on the road (e.g., non-recurrent traffic breakdown). In either way, the objective is to inform traffic operators of unreported incidents in real time and as early as possible. The key is to stay ahead of the curve. Time is of the essence.\nConventional automatic incident detection (AID) methods often struggle with early detection due to their limited consideration of spatial effects and early-stage characteristics. Therefore, we propose a deep learning framework utilizing prior domain knowledge and model-designing strategies. This allows the model to detect a broader range of anomalies, not only incidents that significantly influence traffic flow but also early characteristics of incidents along with historically unreported anomalies. We specially design the model to target the early-stage detection/prediction of an incident. Additionally, unlike most conventional AID studies, our method is highly scalable and generalizable, as it is fully automated with no manual selection of historical reports required, relies solely on widely available low-cost data, and requires no additional detectors. The experimental results across numerous road segments on different maps demonstrate that our model leads to more effective and early anomaly detection.",

Unlike previous structural pruning methods designed for classification models that deal with lowdimensional classification logits, generative Code LLMs produce high-dimensional token logit sequences, making traditional pruning objectives inherently limited. Moreover, existing single component pruning approaches further constrain the effectiveness when applied to generative Code LLMs. In response, we propose Flab-Pruner, an innovative unified structural pruning method that combines vocabulary, layer, and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) pruning. This approach effectively reduces model parameters while maintaining performance. Additionally, we introduce a customized code instruction data strategy for coding tasks to enhance the performance recovery efficiency of the pruned model. Through extensive evaluations on three state-of-the-art Code LLMs across multiple generative coding tasks, the results demonstrate that Flab-Pruner retains 97% of the original performance after pruning 22% of the parameters and achieves the same or even better performance after post-training. The pruned models exhibit significant improvements in storage, GPU usage, computational efficiency, and environmental impact, while maintaining well robustness.

Performance was assessed using supervised and unsupervised models, and an ablation study compared results. Kinematic features--RMS velocity, RMS acceleration, RMS jerk, total path length, and Bimanual Dexterity--were extracted and analyzed using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, and XGBoost.

We use GRUs, LSTMs, and Transformers trained using Next Token Prediction (NTP) on numeric tasks where the solutions to the tasks depend on numeric information only latent in the task structure. We show through multiple causal and theoretical methods that we can interpret NN's raw activity through the lens of simplified SAs when we frame the neural activity in terms of interpretable subspaces rather than individual neurons. Depending on the analysis, however, these interpretations can be graded, existing on a continuum, highlighting the philosophical question of what it means to \"interpret\" neural activity, and motivating us to introduce Alignment Functions to add flexibility to the existing Distributed Alignment Search (DAS) method. Through our specific analyses we show the importance of causal interventions for NN interpretability; we show that recurrent models develop graded, symbol-like number variables within their neural activity; we introduce a generalization of DAS to frame NN activity in terms of linear functions of interpretable variables; and we show that Transformers must use anti-Markovian solutions -- solutions that avoid using cumulative, Markovian hidden states -- in the absence of sufficient attention layers.

In this work, we introduce Model Alignment Search (MAS), a method for causally exploring distributed representational similarity as it relates to behavior. The method learns invertible linear transformations that find an aligned subspace between two distributed networks' representations where functional information can be isolated and manipulated. We first show that the method can be used to transfer values of specific causal variables -- such as the number of items in a counting task -- between networks with different training seeds and different architectures. We then explore open questions in number cognition by comparing different types of numeric representations in models trained on structurally different tasks, we explore differences between MAS and preexisting functional similarity methods, and lastly, we introduce a counterfactual latent auxiliary loss that helps shape functionally relevant alignments even in cases where we do not have causal access to one of the two models for training.",

This work advances model-based reinforcement learning by addressing the challenges of long-horizon prediction, error accumulation, and sim-to-real transfer. By providing a scalable and robust framework, the introduced methods pave the way for adaptive and efficient robotic systems in real-world applications.",

    "summary": "Given multi-type point maps from different place-types (e.g., tumor regions), our objective is to develop a classifier trained on the source place-type to accurately distinguish between two classes of the target place-type based on their point arrangements. This problem is societally important for many applications, such as generating clinical hypotheses for designing new immunotherapies for cancer treatment. The challenge lies in the spatial variability, the inherent heterogeneity and variation observed in spatial properties or arrangements across different locations (i.e., place-types). Previous techniques focus on self-supervised tasks to learn domain-invariant features and mitigate domain differences; however, they often neglect the underlying spatial arrangements among data points, leading to significant discrepancies across different place-types. We explore a novel multi-task self-learning framework that targets spatial arrangements, such as spatial mix-up masking and spatial contrastive predictive coding, for spatially-delineated domain-adapted AI classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets (e.g., oncology data) show that the proposed framework provides higher prediction accuracy than baseline methods.",

    "summary": "The attribution of the author of an art piece is typically a laborious manual process, usually relying on subjective evaluations of expert figures. However, there are some situations in which quantitative features of the artwork can support these evaluations. The extraction of these features can sometimes be automated, for instance, with the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. An example of these features is represented by repeated, mechanically impressed patterns, called punches, present chiefly in 13th and 14th-century panel paintings from Tuscany. Previous research in art history showcased a strong connection between the shapes of punches and specific artists or workshops, suggesting the possibility of using these quantitative cues to support the attribution. In the present work, we first collect a dataset of large-scale images of these panel paintings. Then, using YOLOv10, a recent and popular object detection model, we train a ML pipeline to perform object detection on the punches contained in the images. Due to the large size of the images, the detection procedure is split across multiple frames by adopting a sliding-window approach with overlaps, after which the predictions are combined for the whole image using a custom non-maximal suppression routine. Our results indicate how art historians working in the field can reliably use our method for the identification and extraction of punches.",

While GraphRAG has demonstrated success across domains, its security implications remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, this work examines GraphRAG's vulnerability to poisoning attacks, uncovering an intriguing security paradox: compared to conventional RAG, GraphRAG's graph-based indexing and retrieval enhance resilience against simple poisoning attacks; yet, the same features also create new attack surfaces. We present GRAGPoison, a novel attack that exploits shared relations in the underlying knowledge graph to craft poisoning text capable of compromising multiple queries simultaneously. GRAGPoison employs three key strategies: i) relation injection to introduce false knowledge, ii) relation enhancement to amplify poisoning influence, and iii) narrative generation to embed malicious content within coherent text. Empirical evaluation across diverse datasets and models shows that GRAGPoison substantially outperforms existing attacks in terms of effectiveness (up to 98\\% success rate) and scalability (using less than 68\\% poisoning text) on various GraphRAG-based systems. We also explore potential defensive measures and their limitations, identifying promising directions for future research.",

    "summary": "The integration of contextual embeddings into the optimization processes of large language models is an advancement in natural language processing. The Context-Aware Neural Gradient Mapping framework introduces a dynamic gradient adjustment mechanism, incorporating contextual embeddings directly into the optimization process. This approach facilitates real-time parameter adjustments, enhancing task-specific generalization even in the presence of sparse or noisy data inputs. The mathematical foundation of this framework relies on gradient descent modifications, where contextual embeddings are derived from a supplementary neural network trained to map input features to optimal adaptation gradients. By employing differential geometry principles, high-dimensional input dependencies are encoded into low-dimensional gradient manifolds, enabling efficient adaptation without necessitating the retraining of the entire model. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline models across various metrics, including accuracy, robustness to noise, and computational efficiency. The integration of context-specific embeddings allows for a more complex understanding of language, thereby improving the model's ability to handle diverse linguistic phenomena. Furthermore, the computational efficiency achieved through this method demonstrates its scalability for large-scale language models operating under diverse constraints.",

For example, computer vision predictions of economic and environmental indicators based on satellite imagery are used in downstream regressions; similarly, language models are widely used to approximate human ratings and opinions in social science research. However, failure to properly account for errors in the machine learning predictions renders standard statistical procedures invalid. Prior work uses what we call the Predict-Then-Debias estimator to give valid confidence intervals when machine learning algorithms impute missing variables, assuming a small complete sample from the population of interest. We expand the scope by introducing bootstrap confidence intervals that apply when the complete data is a nonuniform (i.e., weighted, stratified, or clustered) sample and to settings where an arbitrary subset of features is imputed. Importantly, the method can be applied to many settings without requiring additional calculations. We prove that these confidence intervals are valid under no assumptions on the quality of the machine learning model and are no wider than the intervals obtained by methods that do not use machine learning predictions.",

We evaluated multiple SSM architectures across diverse datasets representing various Indic languages and conducted a comparative analysis of their performance. Our results demonstrate that these models effectively capture linguistic subtleties, leading to significant improvements in question interpretation, context alignment, and answer generation. This work represents the first application of SSMs to question answering tasks in Indic languages, establishing a foundational benchmark for future research in this domain. We propose enhancements to existing SSM frameworks, optimizing their applicability to low-resource settings and multilingual scenarios prevalent in Indic languages.",

Recent applications in machine learning motivate the need to understand finite-time error rates, but conventional stochastic approximation analysis focus on either asymptotic convergence in distribution or finite-time bounds that are far from optimal. Prior work on asymptotic central limit theorems (CLTs) suggest that two-time-scale algorithms may be able to achieve $1/\\sqrt{n}$ error in expectation, with a constant given by the expected norm of the limiting Gaussian vector. However, the best known finite-time rates are much slower. We derive the first non-asymptotic central limit theorem with respect to the Wasserstein-1 distance for two-time-scale stochastic approximation with Polyak-Ruppert averaging. As a corollary, we show that expected error achieved by Polyak-Ruppert averaging decays at rate $1/\\sqrt{n}$, which significantly improves on the rates of convergence in prior works.",

    "summary": "Reasoning has long been viewed as an emergent property of large language models (LLMs), appearing at or above a certain scale ($\\sim$100B parameters). However, recent studies challenge this assumption, showing that small language models (SLMs) can also achieve competitive reasoning performance. SLMs are increasingly favored for their efficiency and deployability. However, there is a lack of systematic study on the reasoning abilities of diverse SLMs, including those trained from scratch or derived from LLMs through quantization, pruning, and distillation. This raises a critical question: Can SLMs achieve reasoning abilities comparable to LLMs? In this work, we systematically survey, benchmark, and analyze 72 SLMs from six model families across 14 reasoning benchmarks. For reliable evaluation, we examine four evaluation methods and compare four LLM judges against human evaluations on 800 data points. We repeat all experiments three times to ensure a robust performance assessment. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different prompting strategies in small models. Beyond accuracy, we also evaluate model robustness under adversarial conditions and intermediate reasoning steps. Our findings challenge the assumption that scaling is the only way to achieve strong reasoning. Instead, we foresee a future where SLMs with strong reasoning capabilities can be developed through structured training or post-training compression. They can serve as efficient alternatives to LLMs for reasoning-intensive tasks.",

For instance, they can reveal sensitive information that can be inferred from location data. This location data is shared through service providers as well as mobile applications. Understanding how and with whom users share their location data -- as well as users' perception of the underlying privacy risks --, are important notions to grasp in order to design usable privacy-enhancing technologies. In this work, we perform a quantitative and qualitative analysis of smartphone users' awareness, perception and self-reported behavior towards location data-sharing through a survey of n=99 young adult participants (i.e., digital natives). We compare stated practices with actual behaviors to better understand their mental models, and survey participants' understanding of privacy risks before and after the inspection of location traces and the information that can be inferred therefrom.\nOur empirical results show that participants have risky privacy practices: about 54% of participants underestimate the number of mobile applications to which they have granted access to their data, and 33% forget or do not think of revoking access to their data. Also, by using a demonstrator to perform inferences from location data, we observe that slightly more than half of participants (57%) are surprised by the extent of potentially inferred information, and that 47% intend to reduce access to their data via permissions as a result of using the demonstrator. Last, a majority of participants have little knowledge of the tools to better protect themselves, but are nonetheless willing to follow suggestions to improve privacy (51%). Educating people, including digital natives, about privacy risks through transparency tools seems a promising approach.",

The dataset is collected by a coached human-human data collection protocol and is available for dual markets and two languages. By formulating the task of CPS, the dataset allows for comprehensive and in-depth research on six subtasks: user intent detection, keyword extraction, system action prediction, question selection, item ranking, and response generation.

To address this, we present HyperDAS, a transformer-based hypernetwork architecture that (1) automatically locates the token-positions of the residual stream that a concept is realized in and (2) constructs features of those residual stream vectors for the concept. In experiments with Llama3-8B, HyperDAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the RAVEL benchmark for disentangling concepts in hidden states. In addition, we review the design decisions we made to mitigate the concern that HyperDAS (like all powerful interpretabilty methods) might inject new information into the target model rather than faithfully interpreting it.",

This decision should take into account both the variability of the objective functions and the current estimate of a point in relation to the Pareto front. Since the amount and distribution of noise are generally unknown, it is desirable for a decision function to be highly adaptive to the properties of the optimization problem. This paper presents a resampling decision function that incorporates the stochastic nature of the optimization problem by using bootstrapping and the probability of dominance. The distribution-free estimation of the probability of dominance is achieved using bootstrap estimates of the means. To make the procedure applicable even with very few observations, we transfer the distribution observed at other decision points. The efficiency of this resampling approach is demonstrated by applying it in the NSGA-II algorithm with a sequential resampling procedure under multiple noise variations.",

    "summary": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks; however, their ability to perform Theory of Mind (ToM) tasks, such as inferring human intentions, beliefs, and mental states, remains underexplored. We propose an open-ended question framework to evaluate VLMs' performance across diverse categories of ToM tasks. We curated and annotated a benchmark dataset of 30 images and evaluated the performance of four VLMs of varying sizes. Our results show that the GPT-4 model outperformed all the others, with only one smaller model, GPT-4o-mini, achieving comparable performance. We observed that VLMs often struggle to infer intentions in complex scenarios such as bullying or cheating. Our findings reveal that smaller models can sometimes infer correct intentions despite relying on incorrect visual cues. The dataset is available at this https URL.",

    "summary": "This paper examines memory mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing their importance for context-rich responses, reduced hallucinations, and improved efficiency. It categorizes memory into sensory, short-term, and long-term, with sensory memory corresponding to input prompts, short-term memory processing immediate context, and long-term memory implemented via external databases or structures. The text-based memory section covers acquisition (selection and summarization), management (updating, accessing, storing, and resolving conflicts), and utilization (full-text search, SQL queries, semantic search). The KV cache-based memory section discusses selection methods (regularity-based summarization, score-based approaches, special token embeddings) and compression techniques (low-rank compression, KV merging, multimodal compression), along with management strategies like offloading and shared attention mechanisms. Parameter-based memory methods (LoRA, TTT, MoE) transform memories into model parameters to enhance efficiency, while hidden-state-based memory approaches (chunk mechanisms, recurrent transformers, Mamba model) improve long-text processing by combining RNN hidden states with current methods. Overall, the paper offers a comprehensive analysis of LLM memory mechanisms, highlighting their significance and future research directions.",

    "summary": "The structure of causal language model training assumes that each token can be accurately predicted from the previous context. This contrasts with humans' natural writing and reasoning process, where goals are typically known before the exact argument or phrasings. While this mismatch has been well studied in the literature, the working assumption has been that architectural changes are needed to address this mismatch. We argue that rearranging and processing the training data sequences can allow models to more accurately imitate the true data-generating process, and does not require any other changes to the architecture or training infrastructure. We demonstrate that this technique, Trelawney, and the inference algorithms derived from it allow us to improve performance on several key benchmarks that span planning, algorithmic reasoning, and story generation tasks. Finally, our method naturally enables the generation of long-term goals at no additional cost. We investigate how using the model's goal-generation capability can further improve planning and reasoning. Additionally, we believe Trelawney could potentially open doors to new capabilities beyond the current language modeling paradigm.",

    "summary": "Leveraging inference-time search in large language models has proven effective in further enhancing a trained model's capability to solve complex mathematical and reasoning problems. However, this approach significantly increases computational costs and inference time, as the model must generate and evaluate multiple candidate solutions to identify a viable reasoning path. To address this, we propose an effective approach that integrates search capabilities directly into the model by fine-tuning it using both successful (learning) and failed reasoning paths (forgetting) derived from diverse search methods. While fine-tuning the model with these data might seem straightforward, we identify a critical issue: the model's search capability tends to degrade rapidly if fine-tuning is performed naively. We show that this degradation can be substantially mitigated by employing a smaller learning rate. Extensive experiments on the challenging Game-of-24 and Countdown mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our approach not only outperforms both standard fine-tuning and inference-time search baselines but also significantly reduces inference time by 180$\\times$.",

Our approach features a novel deep generative model, CSegSynth, which outperforms existing prominent generative models, including conditional variational autoencoder (C-VAE), conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN), and conditional latent diffusion model (C-LDM). We demonstrate the high quality of our synthetic segmentations through extensive evaluations. Also, in assessing the effectiveness of the individual-specific generation, we achieve superior volume prediction, with mean absolute errors of only 36.44mL, 29.20mL, and 35.51mL between the ground-truth WM, GM, and CSF volumes of test individuals and those volumes predicted based on generated individual-specific segmentations, respectively.",

    "summary": "Recently, Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered recommender systems (RecSys) have brought significant advances in personalized user experience and have attracted considerable attention. Despite the impressive progress, the research question regarding the safety vulnerability of LLM-empowered RecSys still remains largely under-investigated. Given the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to focus on attacking the black-box RecSys, where attackers can only observe the system's inputs and outputs. However, traditional attack approaches employing reinforcement learning (RL) agents are not effective for attacking LLM-empowered RecSys due to the limited capabilities in processing complex textual inputs, planning, and reasoning. On the other hand, LLMs provide unprecedented opportunities to serve as attack agents to attack RecSys because of their impressive capability in simulating human-like decision-making processes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel attack framework called CheatAgent by harnessing the human-like capabilities of LLMs, where an LLM-based agent is developed to attack LLM-Empowered RecSys. Specifically, our method first identifies the insertion position for maximum impact with minimal input modification. After that, the LLM agent is designed to generate adversarial perturbations to insert at target positions. To further improve the quality of generated perturbations, we utilize the prompt tuning technique to improve attacking strategies via feedback from the victim RecSys iteratively. Extensive experiments across three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attacking method.",

It addresses critical challenges related to fairness, transparency, and ethical implications in these systems, providing a comparative analysis of key tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), image captioning, and visual dialogue. Background: Multimodal models, particularly vision-language models, enhance artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities by integrating visual and textual data, mimicking human learning processes. Despite significant advancements, the trustworthiness of these models remains a crucial concern, particularly as AI systems increasingly confront issues regarding fairness, transparency, and ethics.

It employs a comparative approach to analyze these tasks through the lens of trustworthiness, underlining fairness, explainability, and ethics. This study synthesizes findings from recent literature to identify trends, challenges, and state-of-the-art solutions. Results: Several key findings were highlighted. Transparency: Explainability of vision language tasks is important for user trust. Techniques, such as attention maps and gradient-based methods, have successfully addressed this issue. Fairness: Bias mitigation in VQA and visual dialogue systems is essential for ensuring unbiased outcomes across diverse demographic groups. Ethical Implications: Addressing biases in multilingual models and ensuring ethical data handling is critical for the responsible deployment of vision-language systems. Conclusion: This study underscores the importance of integrating fairness, transparency, and ethical considerations in developing vision-language models within a unified framework.",

    "summary": "Menisci are cartilaginous tissue found within the knee that contribute to joint lubrication and weight dispersal. Damage to menisci can lead to onset and progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA), a condition that is a leading cause of disability, and for which there are few effective therapies. Accurate automated segmentation of menisci would allow for earlier detection and treatment of meniscal abnormalities, as well as shedding more light on the role the menisci play in OA pathogenesis. Focus in this area has mainly used variants of convolutional networks, but there has been no attempt to utilise recent large vision transformer segmentation models. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a so-called foundation segmentation model, which has been found useful across a range of different tasks due to the large volume of data used for training the model. In this study, SAM was adapted to perform fully-automated segmentation of menisci from 3D knee magnetic resonance images. A 3D U-Net was also trained as a baseline. It was found that, when fine-tuning only the decoder, SAM was unable to compete with 3D U-Net, achieving a Dice score of $0.81\\pm0.03$, compared to $0.87\\pm0.03$, on a held-out test set. When fine-tuning SAM end-to-end, a Dice score of $0.87\\pm0.03$ was achieved. The performance of both the end-to-end trained SAM configuration and the 3D U-Net were comparable to the winning Dice score ($0.88\\pm0.03$) in the IWOAI Knee MRI Segmentation Challenge 2019. Performance in terms of the Hausdorff Distance showed that both configurations of SAM were inferior to 3D U-Net in matching the meniscus morphology. Results demonstrated that, despite its generalisability, SAM was unable to outperform a basic 3D U-Net in meniscus segmentation, and may not be suitable for similar 3D medical image segmentation tasks also involving fine anatomical structures with low contrast and poorly-defined boundaries.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities, particularly when enhanced through Reinforcement Learning (RL). While prior work has successfully applied RL to mathematical reasoning -- where rules and correctness are well-defined -- generalizing these methods to broader reasoning domains remains challenging due to limited data, the lack of verifiable reward structures, and diverse task requirements. In this work, we propose NEMOTRON-CROSSTHINK, a framework that systematically incorporates multi-domain corpora, including both synthetic and real-world question-answer pairs, into RL training to improve generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. NEMOTRON-CROSSTHINK addresses key challenges by (1) incorporating data from varied sources spanning STEM, humanities, social sciences, etc.; (2) applying structured templates (e.g., multiple-choice and open-ended) to control answer-space complexity; (3) filtering for verifiable answers; and (4) optimizing data blending strategies that utilizes data from multiple sources effectively. Our approach enables scalable and verifiable reward modeling beyond mathematics and demonstrates improved accuracies on both math (MATH-500: +30.1%, AMC23:+27.5%) and non-math reasoning benchmarks (MMLU-PRO: +12.8%, GPQA-DIAMOND: +11.3%, AGIEVAL: +15.1%, SUPERGPQA: +3.8%). Moreover, NEMOTRON-CROSSTHINK exhibits significantly improved response efficiency -- using 28% fewer tokens for correct answers -- highlighting more focused and effective reasoning. Through NEMOTRON-CROSSTHINK, we demonstrate that integrating multi-domain, multi-format data in RL leads to more accurate, efficient, and generalizable LLMs.",

    "summary": "Diagnostic imaging relies on interpreting both images and radiology reports, but the growing data volumes place significant pressure on medical experts, yielding increased errors and workflow backlogs. Medical vision-language models (med-VLMs) have emerged as a powerful framework to efficiently process multimodal imaging data, particularly in chest X-ray (CXR) evaluations, albeit their performance hinges on how well image and text representations are aligned. Existing alignment methods, predominantly based on contrastive learning, prioritize separation between disease classes over segregation of fine-grained pathology attributes like location, size or severity, leading to suboptimal representations. Here, we propose MedTrim (Meta-entity-driven Triplet mining), a novel method that enhances image-text alignment through multimodal triplet learning synergistically guided by disease class as well as adjectival and directional pathology descriptors. Unlike common alignment methods that separate broad disease classes, MedTrim leverages structured meta-entity information to preserve subtle but clinically significant intra-class variations. For this purpose, we first introduce an ontology-based entity recognition module that extracts pathology-specific meta-entities from CXR reports, as annotations on pathology attributes are rare in public datasets. For refined sample selection in triplet mining, we then introduce a novel score function that captures an aggregate measure of inter-sample similarity based on disease classes and adjectival/directional descriptors. Lastly, we introduce a multimodal triplet alignment objective for explicit within- and cross-modal alignment between samples sharing detailed pathology characteristics. Our demonstrations indicate that MedTrim improves performance in downstream retrieval and classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art alignment methods.",

However, existing AI-based detection models for NFT contract vulnerabilities remain limited due to their complexity, while traditional manual methods are time-consuming and costly. This study proposes an AI-driven approach to detect vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts.\nWe collected 16,527 public smart contract codes, classifying them into five vulnerability categories: Risky Mutable Proxy, ERC-721 Reentrancy, Unlimited Minting, Missing Requirements, and Public Burn. Python-processed data was structured into training/test sets. Using the CART algorithm with Gini coefficient evaluation, we built initial decision trees for feature extraction. A random forest model was implemented to improve robustness through random data/feature sampling and multitree integration. GridSearch hyperparameter tuning further optimized the model, with 3D visualizations demonstrating parameter impacts on vulnerability detection.\nResults show the random forest model excels in detecting all five vulnerabilities. For example, it identifies Risky Mutable Proxy by analyzing authorization mechanisms and state modifications, while ERC-721 Reentrancy detection relies on external call locations and lock mechanisms. The ensemble approach effectively reduces single-tree overfitting, with stable performance improvements after parameter tuning. This method provides an efficient technical solution for automated NFT contract detection and lays groundwork for scaling AI applications.",

    "summary": "LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex, agentic tasks requiring multifaceted reasoning and collaboration, from generating high-quality presentation slides to conducting sophisticated scientific research. Meanwhile, RL has been widely recognized for its effectiveness in enhancing agent intelligence, but limited research has investigated the fine-tuning of LaMAS using foundational RL techniques. Moreover, the direct application of MARL methodologies to LaMAS introduces significant challenges, stemming from the unique characteristics and mechanisms inherent to LaMAS. To address these challenges, this article presents a comprehensive study of LLM-based MARL and proposes a novel paradigm termed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MARFT). We introduce a universal algorithmic framework tailored for LaMAS, outlining the conceptual foundations, key distinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We begin by reviewing the evolution from RL to Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, setting the stage for a parallel analysis in the multi-agent domain. In the context of LaMAS, we elucidate critical differences between MARL and MARFT. These differences motivate a transition toward a novel, LaMAS-oriented formulation of RFT. Central to this work is the presentation of a robust and scalable MARFT framework.

    "summary": "Multimodal language analysis is a rapidly evolving field that leverages multiple modalities to enhance the understanding of high-level semantics underlying human conversational utterances. Despite its significance, little research has investigated the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehend cognitive-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce MMLA, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to address this gap. MMLA comprises over 61K multimodal utterances drawn from both staged and real-world scenarios, covering six core dimensions of multimodal semantics: intent, emotion, dialogue act, sentiment, speaking style, and communication behavior. We evaluate eight mainstream branches of LLMs and MLLMs using three methods: zero-shot inference, supervised fine-tuning, and instruction tuning. Extensive experiments reveal that even fine-tuned models achieve only about 60%~70% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current MLLMs in understanding complex human language. We believe that MMLA will serve as a solid foundation for exploring the potential of large language models in multimodal language analysis and provide valuable resources to advance this field.

    "summary": "Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) excel in various vision-language tasks. Yet, their robustness to visual variations in position, scale, orientation, and context that objects in natural scenes inevitably exhibit due to changes in viewpoint and environment remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce V$^2$R-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating Visual Variation Robustness of LVLMs, which encompasses automated evaluation dataset generation and principled metrics for thorough robustness assessment. Through extensive evaluation on 21 LVLMs, we reveal a surprising vulnerability to visual variations, in which even advanced models that excel at complex vision-language tasks significantly underperform on simple tasks such as object recognition. Interestingly, these models exhibit a distinct visual position bias that contradicts theories of effective receptive fields, and demonstrate a human-like visual acuity threshold. To identify the source of these vulnerabilities, we present a systematic framework for component-level analysis, featuring a novel visualization approach for aligned visual features. Results show that these vulnerabilities stem from error accumulation in the pipeline architecture and inadequate multimodal alignment. Complementary experiments with synthetic data further demonstrate that these limitations are fundamentally architectural deficiencies, scoring the need for architectural innovations in future LVLM designs.",

    "summary": "Formal specifications of on-chip communication protocols are crucial for system-on-chip (SoC) design and verification. However, manually constructing these formal specifications from informal documents remains a tedious and error-prone task. Although recent efforts have used Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate SystemVerilog Assertion (SVA) properties from design documents for Register-Transfer Level (RTL) design verification, in our experience these approaches have not shown promise in generating SVA properties for communication protocols. Since protocol specification documents are unstructured and ambiguous in nature, LLMs often fail to extract the necessary information and end up generating irrelevant or even incorrect properties. We propose FLAG, a two-stage framework to help construct formal protocol specifications from informal documents. In the first stage, a predefined template set is used to generate candidate SVA properties. To avoid missing necessary properties, we develop a grammar-based approach to generate comprehensive template sets that capture critical signal behaviors for various communication protocols. In the second stage, we utilize unambiguous timing diagrams in conjunction with textual descriptions from the specification documents to filter out incorrect properties. A formal approach is first implemented to check the candidate properties and filter out those inconsistent with the timing diagrams. An LLM is then consulted to further remove incorrect properties with respect to the textual description, obtaining the final property set. Experiments on various open-source communication protocols demonstrate the effectiveness of FLAG in generating SVA properties from informal documents.",

However, their efficiency remains hindered by memory-bound operations, particularly in the prefill stage.

This work systematically analyzes SSM acceleration opportunities both from the scheduling perspective through fine-grained operator fusion and the hardware perspective through design space exploration, using an extended version of the Stream modeling framework.\nOur results demonstrate that the improved data locality stemming from our optimized fusion and scheduling strategy enables a speedup of up to 4.8x over unfused execution, while our adaptive memory-aware fusion approach reduces on-chip memory requirements by an order of magnitude without sacrificing performance. We further explore accelerator design trade-offs, showing that a fusion-aware hardware architecture can achieve 1.78x higher performance than the state-of-the-art MARCA accelerator, within the same area budget. These results establish operator fusion as a key enabler for next-generation SSM accelerators.",

This paper addresses these challenges by presenting an efficient framework for deploying the Qwen2.5-0.5B model on the Xilinx Kria KV260 edge platform, a heterogeneous system integrating an ARM Cortex-A53 CPU with reconfigurable FPGA logic. Leveraging Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ) with FPGA-accelerated execution pipelines, the proposed approach enhances both model compression rate and system throughput. Additionally, we propose a hybrid execution strategy that intelligently offloads compute-intensive operations to the FPGA while utilizing the CPU for lighter tasks, effectively balancing the computational workload and maximizing overall performance. Our framework achieves a model compression rate of 55.08% compared to the original model and produces output at a rate of 5.1 tokens per second, outperforming the baseline performance of 2.8 tokens per second.",

While HBM-based acceleration offers high bandwidth, its capacity remains constrained. Offloading data to host-side DIMMs improves capacity but introduces costly data swapping overhead. We identify that the critical memory bottleneck lies in the decoding phase of multi-head attention (MHA) exclusively, which demands substantial capacity for storing KV caches and high bandwidth for attention computation. Our key insight reveals this operation uniquely aligns with modern DIMM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures, which offers scalability of both capacity and bandwidth.\nBased on this observation and insight, we propose L3, a hardware-software co-designed system integrating DIMM-PIM and GPU devices. L3 introduces three innovations: First, hardware redesigns resolve data layout mismatches and computational element mismatches in DIMM-PIM, enhancing LLM inference utilization. Second, communication optimization enables hiding the data transfer overhead with the computation. Third, an adaptive scheduler coordinates GPU-DIMM-PIM operations to maximize parallelism between devices. Evaluations using real-world traces show L3 achieves up to 6.1$\\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art HBM-PIM solutions while significantly improving batch sizes.",

    "summary": "Conventional wisdom holds that an efficient interface between an OS running on a CPU and a high-bandwidth I/O device should use Direct Memory Access (DMA) to offload data transfer, descriptor rings for buffering and queuing, and interrupts for asynchrony between cores and device.\nIn this paper we question this wisdom in the light of two trends: modern and emerging cache-coherent interconnects like CXL3.0, and workloads, particularly microservices and serverless computing. Like some others before us, we argue that the assumptions of the DMA-based model are obsolete, and in many use-cases programmed I/O, where the CPU explicitly transfers data and control information to and from a device via loads and stores, delivers a more efficient system.\nHowever, we push this idea much further. We show, in a real hardware implementation, the gains in latency for fine-grained communication achievable using an open cache-coherence protocol which exposes cache transitions to a smart device, and that throughput is competitive with DMA over modern interconnects. We also demonstrate three use-cases: fine-grained RPC-style invocation of functions on an accelerator, offloading of operators in a streaming dataflow engine, and a network interface targeting serverless functions, comparing our use of coherence with both traditional DMA-style interaction and a highly-optimized implementation using memory-mapped programmed I/O over PCIe.",

However, current CIM solutions face latency and reliability challenges. CIM fidelity lags considerably behind access fidelity. Furthermore, bulk-bitwise CIM, although highly parallelized, requires long latency for operations like multiplication and addition, due to their bit-serial computation. This paper presents Count2Multiply, a technology-agnostic digital CIM approach to perform multiplication, addition and other operations using high-radix, massively parallel counting enabled by CIM bulk-bitwise logic operations. Designed to meet fault tolerance requirements, Count2Multiply integrates traditional row-wise error correction codes, such as Hamming and BCH, to address the high error rates in existing CIM designs. We demonstrate Count2Multiply with a detailed application to CIM in conventional DRAM due to its ubiquity and high endurance. However, we note that the Count2Multiply architecture is compatible with other functionally complete CIM proposals. Compared to the state-of-the-art in-DRAM CIM method, Count2Multiply achieves up to 10x speedup, 8x higher GOPS/Watt, and 9.5x higher GOPS/area, while outperforming GPU for vector-matrix multiplications.",

    "summary": "FPGAs are increasingly used in multi-tenant cloud environments to offload compute-intensive tasks from the main CPU. The operating system (OS) plays a vital role in identifying tasks suitable for offloading and coordinating between the CPU and FPGA for seamless task execution. The OS leverages preemption to manage CPU efficiently and balance CPU time; however, preempting tasks running on FPGAs without context loss remains challenging. Despite growing reliance on FPGAs, vendors have yet to deliver a solution that fully preserves and restores task context.\nThis paper presents EPOCH, the first out-of-the-box framework to seamlessly preserve the state of tasks running on multi-tenant cloud FPGAs. EPOCH enables interrupting a tenant's execution at any arbitrary clock cycle, capturing its state, and saving this 'state snapshot' in off-chip memory with fine-grain granularity. Subsequently, when task resumption is required, EPOCH can resume execution from the saved 'state snapshot', eliminating the need to restart the task from scratch. EPOCH automates intricate processes, shields users from complexities, and synchronizes all underlying logic in a common clock domain, mitigating timing violations and ensuring seamless handling of interruptions.\nEPOCH proficiently captures the state of fundamental FPGA elements, such as look-up tables, flip-flops, block--RAMs, and digital signal processing units. On real hardware, ZynQ-XC7Z020 SoC, the proposed solution achieves context save and restore operations per frame in 62.2us and 67.4us, respectively.",

This work presents a comprehensive methodology for conducting controlled fault injection attacks at the pre-silicon level and an analysis of the underlying system for root-causing behavior. As the driving application, we use the clock glitch attacks in AI/ML applications for critical misclassification. Our study aims to characterize and diagnose the impact of faults within the RISC-V instruction set and pipeline stages, while tracing fault propagation from the circuit level to the AI/ML application software. This analysis resulted in discovering two new vulnerabilities through controlled clock glitch parameters. First, we reveal a novel method for causing instruction skips, thereby preventing the loading of critical values from memory. This can cause disruption and affect program continuity and correctness. Second, we demonstrate an attack that converts legal instructions into illegal ones, thereby diverting control flow in a manner exploitable by attackers. Our work underscores the complexity of fault injection attack exploits and emphasizes the importance of preemptive security analysis.",

    "summary": "The Sum-of-Squares (SoS) hierarchy, also known as Lasserre hierarchy, has emerged as a promising tool in optimization. However, it remains unclear whether fixed-degree SoS proofs can be automated [O'Donnell (2017)]. Indeed, there are examples of polynomial systems with bounded coefficients that admit low-degree SoS proofs, but these proofs necessarily involve numbers with an exponential number of bits, implying that low-degree SoS proofs cannot always be found efficiently.\nA sufficient condition derived from the Nullstellensatz proof system [Raghavendra and Weitz (2017)] identifies cases where bit complexity issues can be circumvented. One of the main problems left open by Raghavendra and Weitz is proving any result for refutations, as their condition applies only to polynomial systems with a large set of solutions.\nIn this work, we broaden the class of polynomial systems for which degree-$d$ SoS proofs can be automated. To achieve this, we develop a new criterion and we demonstrate how our criterion applies to polynomial systems beyond the scope of Raghavendra and Weitz's result. In particular, we establish a separation for instances arising from Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). Moreover, our result extends to refutations, establishing that polynomial-time refutation is possible for broad classes of polynomial time solvable constraint problems, highlighting a first advancement in this area.",

    "summary": "Quantization Aware Training (QAT) is a neural network quantization technique that compresses model size and improves operational efficiency while effectively maintaining model performance. The paradigm of QAT is to introduce fake quantization operators during the training process, allowing the model to autonomously compensate for information loss caused by quantization. Making quantization parameters trainable can significantly improve the performance of QAT, but at the cost of compromising the flexibility during inference, especially when dealing with activation values with substantially different distributions. In this paper, we propose an effective learnable adaptive neural network quantization method, called Adaptive Step Size Quantization (ASQ), to resolve this conflict. Specifically, the proposed ASQ method first dynamically adjusts quantization scaling factors through a trained module capable of accommodating different activations. Then, to address the rigid resolution issue inherent in Power of Two (POT) quantization, we propose an efficient non-uniform quantization scheme. We utilize the Power Of Square root of Two (POST) as the basis for exponential quantization, effectively handling the bell-shaped distribution of neural network weights across various bit-widths while maintaining computational efficiency through a Look-Up Table method (LUT). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ASQ method is superior to the state-of-the-art QAT approaches. Notably that the ASQ is even competitive compared to full precision baselines, with its 4-bit quantized ResNet34 model improving accuracy by 1.2\\% on ImageNet.",

    "summary": "In the knapsack problems with neighborhood constraints that were studied before, the input is a graph $\\mathcal{G}$ on a set $\\mathcal{V}$ of items, each item $v \\in \\mathcal{V}$ has a weight $w_v$ and profit $p_v$, the size $s$ of the knapsack, and the demand $d$. The goal is to compute if there exists a feasible solution whose total weight is at most $s$ and total profit is at most $d$. Here, feasible solutions are all subsets $\\mathcal{S}$ of the items such that, for every item in $\\mathcal{S}$, at least one of its neighbors in $\\mathcal{G}$ is also in $\\mathcal{S}$ for \\hor, and all its neighbors in $\\mathcal{G}$ are also in $\\mathcal{S}$ for \\hand~\\cite{borradaile2012knapsack}. We study a relaxation of the above problems. Specifically, we allow all possible subsets of items to be feasible solutions. However, only those items for which we pick at least one or all of its neighbor (out-neighbor for directed graph) contribute to profit whereas every item picked contribute to the weight; we call the corresponding problems \\sor and \\sand. We show that both \\sor and \\sand are strongly \\NPC even on undirected graphs. Regarding parameterized complexity, we show both \\sor and \\hor are \\WTH parameterized by the size $s$ of the knapsack size. Interestingly, both \\sand and \\hand are \\WOH parameterized by knapsack size, $s$ plus profit demand, $d$ and also parameterized by solution size, $b$. For \\sor and \\hor, we present a randomized color-coding-based pseudo-\\FPT algorithm, parameterized by the solution size $b$, and consequently by the demand $d$. We then consider the treewidth of the input graph as our parameter and design pseudo fixed-parameter tractable (\\FPT) algorithm parameterized by treewidth, $\\text{tw}$ for all variants. Finally, we present an additive $1$ approximation for \\sor when both the weight and profit of every vertex is $1$.",

Our framework applies to problems satisfying two structural properties: (i) All solutions are of equal size and (ii) the family of all solutions can be represented by a surjection from the family of ideals of some finite poset. Under these conditions, we show that the problem of computing $k$ diverse solutions can be reduced to the minimum cost flow problem and the maximum $s$-$t$ flow problem. As applications, we demonstrate that both the unweighted minimum $s$-$t$ cut problem and the stable matching problem satisfy the requirements of our framework.

We present a generalization of the sticky random walk for which Golowich and Vadhan predict a TVD upper bound of $O(\\lambda p^{O(p)})$ using a Fourier-analytic approach. For this family of graphs, we use a combinatorial approach involving the Krawtchouk functions to derive a strengthened TVD of $O(\\lambda)$.

For distributions $P$ and $Q$ over a finite sample space, their statistical similarity is defined as $S_{\\mathrm{stat}}(P, Q) := \\sum_{x} \\min(P(x), Q(x))$. Statistical similarity is a basic measure of similarity between distributions, with several natural interpretations, and captures the Bayes error in prediction and hypothesis testing problems.

This motivates the question of designing approximation algorithms for statistical similarity. Our primary contribution is a Fully Polynomial-Time deterministic Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) for estimating statistical similarity between two product distributions. To obtain this result, we introduce a new variant of the Knapsack problem, which we call the Masked Knapsack problem, and design an FPTAS to estimate the number of solutions of a multidimensional version of this problem. This new technical contribution could be of independent interest. Furthermore, we also establish a complementary hardness result. We show that it is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard to estimate statistical similarity when $P$ and $Q$ are Bayes net distributions of in-degree $2$.",

Robust algorithms can be developed by incorporating nonlinear physical stability principles in their design, such as the entropy production inequality (i.e., the Clausius-Duhem inequality or second law of thermodynamics), rather than by simply adding artificial viscosity (a common approach). This idea is applied to the k-epsilon and two-equation turbulence models by introducing space-time averaging. Then, a set of entropy variables can be defined which leads to a symmetric system of advective-diffusive equations. Positivity and symmetry of the equations require certain constraints on the turbulence diffusivity coefficients and the turbulence source terms.

    "summary": "Effective stock price forecasting (estimating future prices) and prediction (estimating future price changes) are pivotal for investors, regulatory agencies, and policymakers. These tasks enable informed decision-making, risk management, strategic planning, and superior portfolio returns. Despite their importance, forecasting and prediction are challenging due to the dynamic nature of stock price data, which exhibit significant temporal variations in distribution and statistical properties. Additionally, while both forecasting and prediction targets are derived from the same dataset, their statistical characteristics differ significantly. Forecasting targets typically follow a log-normal distribution, characterized by significant shifts in mean and variance over time, whereas prediction targets adhere to a normal distribution. Furthermore, although multi-step forecasting and prediction offer a broader perspective and richer information compared to single-step approaches, it is much more challenging due to factors such as cumulative errors and long-term temporal variance. As a result, many previous works have tackled either single-step stock price forecasting or prediction instead. To address these issues, we introduce a novel model, termed Patched Channel Integration Encoder (PCIE), to tackle both stock price forecasting and prediction. In this model, we utilize multiple stock channels that cover both historical prices and price changes, and design a novel tokenization method to effectively embed these channels in a cross-channel and temporally efficient manner. Specifically, the tokenization process involves univariate patching and temporal learning with a channel-mixing encoder to reduce cumulative errors. Comprehensive experiments validate that PCIE outperforms current state-of-the-art models in forecast and prediction tasks.",

Although accurate numerical methods, like the Boundary Element Method (BEM), are available to compute this quantity, their high computational cost limits their applicability in multi-query contexts, such as uncertainty quantification, parameter identification, and multi-scale algorithms, where many repeated evaluations are required. This study proposes a surrogate modeling framework for predicting the effective contact area using fast-to-evaluate data-driven techniques. Various machine learning algorithms are trained on a precomputed dataset, where the inputs are the imposed load and statistical roughness parameters, and the output is the corresponding effective contact area. All models undergo hyperparameter optimization to enable fair comparisons in terms of predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, evaluated using established quantitative metrics. Among the models, the Kernel Ridge Regressor demonstrates the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, achieving high predictive accuracy, low prediction time, and minimal training overhead-making it a strong candidate for general-purpose surrogate modeling. The Gaussian Process Regressor provides an attractive alternative when uncertainty quantification is required, although it incurs additional computational cost due to variance estimation. The generalization capability of the Kernel Ridge model is validated on an unseen simulation scenario, confirming its ability to transfer to new configurations. Database generation constitutes the dominant cost in the surrogate modeling process. Nevertheless, the approach proves practical and efficient for multi-query tasks, even when accounting for this initial expense.",

Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to generate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer connectivity throughout the architecture. Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized molecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar chemical structures. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen effectively generates diverse conformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its performance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. Given these initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level structure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for predicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for their intrinsic structural flexibility.",

Here we demonstrate a knowledge-injected Bayesian optimization approach for adaptive XANES data collection that incorporates understanding of spectral features like absorption edges and pre-edge peaks. We show this method accurately reconstructs the absorption edge of XANES spectra using only 15-20% of the measurement points typically needed for conventional sampling, while maintaining the ability to determine the x-ray energy of the sharp peak after absorption edge with errors less than 0.03 eV, the absorption edge with errors less than 0.1 eV; and overall root-mean-square errors less than 0.005 compared to compared to traditionally sampled spectra. Our experiments on battery materials and catalysts demonstrate the method's effectiveness for both static and dynamic XANES measurements, improving data collection efficiency and enabling better time resolution for tracking chemical changes.

This is an important reason that makes the design and optimization of microelectronic components (characterized by large solution space and multiphysics constraints) very challenging for traditional methods. By taking as prototypical elements an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and a heterogeneously integrated (HI) interposer, we develop and numerically test an optimization framework based on reinforcement learning (RL). More specifically, we consider the optimization of the bonded interconnect geometry for an ASIC chip as well as the placement of components on a HI interposer while satisfying thermoelastic and design constraints.

    "summary": "Context: Previous research on software aging is limited with focus on dynamic runtime indicators like memory and performance, often neglecting evolutionary indicators like source code comments and narrowly examining legacy issues within the TD context. Objective: We introduce the concept of Aging Debt (AD), representing the increased maintenance efforts and costs needed to keep software updated. We study AD through Self-Admitted Aging Debt (SAAD) observed in source code comments left by software developers. Method: We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analyses to detect and measure AD in software. This includes framing SAAD patterns from the source code comments after analysing the source code context, then utilizing the SAAD patterns to detect SAAD comments. In the process, we develop a taxonomy for SAAD that reflects the temporal aging of software and its associated debt. Then we utilize the taxonomy to quantify the different types of AD prevalent in OSS repositories. Results: Our proposed taxonomy categorizes temporal software aging into Active and Dormant types. Our extensive analysis of over 9,000+ Open Source Software (OSS) repositories reveals that more than 21% repositories exhibit signs of SAAD as observed from our gold standard SAAD dataset. Notably, Dormant AD emerges as the predominant category, highlighting a critical but often overlooked aspect of software maintenance. Conclusion: As software volume grows annually, so do evolutionary aging and maintenance challenges; our proposed taxonomy can aid researchers in detailed software aging studies and help practitioners develop improved and proactive maintenance strategies.",

    "summary": "The train timetabling problem in liberalized railway markets represents a challenge to the coordination between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings. Efficient scheduling is critical in maximizing infrastructure capacity and utilization while adhering as closely as possible to the requests of railway undertakings. These objectives ultimately contribute to maximizing the infrastructure manager's revenues. This paper sets out a modular simulation framework to reproduce the dynamics of deregulated railway systems. Ten metaheuristic algorithms using the MEALPY Python library are then evaluated in order to optimize train schedules in the liberalized Spanish railway market. The results show that the Genetic Algorithm outperforms others in revenue optimization, convergence speed, and schedule adherence. Alternatives, such as Particle Swarm Optimization and Ant Colony Optimization Continuous, show slower convergence and higher variability. The results emphasize the trade-off between scheduling more trains and adhering to requested times, providing insights into solving complex scheduling problems in deregulated railway systems.",

    "summary": "Over the last few decades, European rail transport has undergone major changes as part of the process of liberalization set out in European regulations. In this context of liberalization, railway undertakings compete with each other for the limited infrastructure capacity available to offer their rail services. The infrastructure manager is responsible for the equitable allocation of infrastructure between all companies in the market, which is essential to ensure the efficiency and sustainability of this competitive ecosystem. In this paper, a methodology based on Jain, Gini and Atkinson equity metrics is used to solve the rail service allocation problem in a liberalized railway market, analyzing the solutions obtained. The results show that the proposed methodology and the equity metrics used allow for equitable planning in different competitiveness scenarios. These results contrast with solutions where the objective of the infrastructure manager is to maximize its own profit, without regard for the equitable allocation of infrastructure. Therefore, the computational tests support the methodology and metrics used as a planning and decision support tool in a liberalized railway market.",

    "summary": "The Fréchet distance is a distance measure between trajectories in the plane or walks in a graph G. Given constant-time shortest path queries in a graph G, the Discrete Fréchet distance $F_G(P, Q)$ between two walks P and Q can be computed in $O(|P| \\cdot |Q|)$ time using a dynamic program. Driemel, van der Hoog, and Rotenberg [SoCG'22] show that for weighted planar graphs this approach is likely tight, as there can be no strongly subquadratic algorithm to compute a $1.01$-approximation of $F_G(P, Q)$ unless the Orthogonal Vector Hypothesis (OVH) fails.\nSuch quadratic-time conditional lower bounds are common to many Fréchet distance variants. However, they can be circumvented by assuming that the input comes from some well-behaved class: There exist $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximations, both in weighted graphs and in Rd, that take near-linear time for $c$-packed or $\\kappa$-straight walks in the graph. In Rd, there also exists a near-linear time algorithm to compute the Fréchet distance whenever all input edges are long compared to the distance.\nWe consider computing the Fréchet distance in unweighted planar graphs. We show that there exist no 1.25-approximations of the discrete Fréchet distance between two disjoint simple paths in an unweighted planar graph in strongly subquadratic time, unless OVH fails. This improves the previous lower bound, both in terms of generality and approximation factor. We subsequently show that adding graph structure circumvents this lower bound: If the graph is a regular tiling with unit-weighted edges, then there exists an $\\tilde{O}( (|P| + |Q|)^{1.5})$-time algorithm to compute $D_F(P, Q)$. Our result has natural implications in the plane, as it allows us to define a new class of well-behaved curves that facilitate $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximations of their discrete Fréchet distance in subquadratic time.",

    "summary": "Many application areas collect unstructured trajectory data. In subtrajectory clustering, one is interested to find patterns in this data using a hybrid combination of segmentation and clustering. We analyze two variants of this problem based on the well-known \\textsc{SetCover} and \\textsc{CoverageMaximization} problems. In both variants the set system is induced by metric balls under the Fréchet distance centered at polygonal curves. Our algorithms focus on improving the running time of the update step of the generic greedy algorithm by means of a careful combination of sweeps through a candidate space. In the first variant, we are given a polygonal curve $P$ of complexity $n$, distance threshold $\\Delta$ and complexity bound $\\ell$ and the goal is to identify a minimum-size set of center curves $\\mathcal{C}$, where each center curve is of complexity at most $\\ell$ and every point $p$ on $P$ is covered. A point $p$ on $P$ is covered if it is part of a subtrajectory $\\pi_p$ of $P$ such that there is a center $c\\in\\mathcal{C}$ whose Fréchet distance to $\\pi_p$ is at most $\\Delta$. We present an approximation algorithm for this problem with a running time of $O((n^2\\ell + \\sqrt{k_\\Delta}n^{5/2})\\log^2n)$, where $k_\\Delta$ is the size of an optimal solution. The algorithm gives a bicriterial approximation guarantee that relaxes the Fréchet distance threshold by a constant factor and the size of the solution by a factor of $O(\\log n)$. The second problem variant asks for the maximum fraction of the input curve $P$ that can be covered using $k$ center curves, where $k\\leq n$ is a parameter to the algorithm. Here, we show that our techniques lead to an algorithm with a running time of $O((k+\\ell)n^2\\log^2 n)$ and similar approximation guarantees. Note that in both algorithms $k,k_\\Delta\\in O(n)$ and hence the running time is cubic, or better if $k\\ll n$.",

Leveraging the Bi-Mamba architecture, GeneMamba captures bidirectional gene context with linear-time complexity, offering substantial computational gains over transformer baselines. The model is pretrained on nearly 30 million cells and incorporates biologically informed objectives, including pathway-aware contrastive loss and rank-based gene encoding. We evaluate GeneMamba across diverse tasks, including multi-batch integration, cell type annotation, and gene-gene correlation, demonstrating strong performance, interpretability, and robustness. These results position GeneMamba as a practical and powerful alternative to transformer-based methods, advancing the development of biologically grounded, scalable tools for large-scale single-cell data analysis.",

    "summary": "Tokenization is a critical component of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially for low resource languages, where subword segmentation influences vocabulary structure and downstream task accuracy. Although Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is a standard tokenization method in multilingual language models, its suitability for Named Entity Recognition (NER) in low resource Indic languages remains underexplored due to its limitations in handling morphological complexity. In this work, we systematically compare BPE, SentencePiece, and Character Level tokenization strategies using IndicBERT for NER tasks in low resource Indic languages like Assamese, Bengali, Marathi, and Odia, as well as extremely low resource Indic languages like Santali, Manipuri, and Sindhi. We assess both intrinsic linguistic properties tokenization efficiency, out of vocabulary (OOV) rates, and morphological preservation as well as extrinsic downstream performance, including fine tuning and zero shot cross lingual transfer.\nOur experiments show that SentencePiece is a consistently better performing approach than BPE for NER in low resource Indic Languages, particularly in zero shot cross lingual settings, as it better preserves entity consistency. While BPE provides the most compact tokenization form, it is not capable of generalization because it misclassifies or even fails to recognize entity labels when tested on unseen languages. In contrast, SentencePiece constitutes a better linguistic structural preservation model, benefiting extremely low resource and morphologically rich Indic languages, such as Santali and Manipuri, for superior entity recognition, as well as high generalization across scripts, such as Sindhi, written in Arabic. The results point to SentencePiece as the more effective tokenization strategy for NER within multilingual and low resource Indic NLP applications.",

While state-of-the-art LLMs can handle other languages, due to language contamination or some degree of multilingual pretraining data, they are not optimized for non-English languages, leading to inefficient encoding (high token \"fertility\") and slower inference speed. In this work, we thoroughly compare a variety of vocabulary adaptation techniques for optimizing English LLMs for the Italian language, and put forward Semantic Alignment Vocabulary Adaptation (SAVA), a novel method that leverages neural mapping for vocabulary substitution. SAVA achieves competitive performance across multiple downstream tasks, enhancing grounded alignment strategies. We adapt two LLMs: Mistral-7b-v0.1, reducing token fertility by 25\\%, and Llama-3.1-8B, optimizing the vocabulary and reducing the number of parameters by 1 billion. We show that, following the adaptation of the vocabulary, these models can recover their performance with a relatively limited stage of continual training on the target language. Finally, we test the capabilities of the adapted models on various multi-choice and generative tasks.",

While prior research has primarily categorized LLM outputs as left- or right-leaning to assess their political stances, a critical question remains: Do these responses reflect genuine internal beliefs or merely surface-level alignment with training data? To address this, we propose a novel framework for evaluating belief depth by analyzing (1) argumentative consistency and (2) uncertainty quantification. We evaluate 12 LLMs on 19 economic policies from the Political Compass Test, challenging their belief stability with both supportive and opposing arguments. Our analysis reveals that LLMs exhibit topic-specific belief stability rather than a uniform ideological stance. Notably, up to 95% of left-leaning models' responses and 89% of right-leaning models' responses remain consistent under the challenge, enabling semantic entropy to achieve high accuracy (AUROC=0.78), effectively distinguishing between surface-level alignment from genuine belief. These findings call into question the assumption that LLMs maintain stable, human-like political ideologies, emphasizing the importance of conducting topic-specific reliability assessments for real-world applications.",

However, it has gone unexamined whether these evaluation methods have convergent validity, that is, whether their results align. Therefore, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of these methods across three existing datasets for LLM misgendering. We propose a method to transform each dataset to enable parallel probability- and generation-based evaluation. Then, by automatically evaluating a suite of 6 models from 3 families, we find that these methods can disagree with each other at the instance, dataset, and model levels, conflicting on 20.2% of evaluation instances. Finally, with a human evaluation of 2400 LLM generations, we show that misgendering behaviour is complex and goes far beyond pronouns, which automatic evaluations are not currently designed to capture, suggesting essential disagreement with human evaluations. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future evaluations of LLM misgendering. Our results are also more widely relevant, as they call into question broader methodological conventions in LLM evaluation, which often assume that different evaluation methods agree.",

    "summary": "What makes an interaction with the LLM more preferable for the user? While it is intuitive to assume that information accuracy in the LLM's responses would be one of the influential variables, recent studies have found that inaccurate LLM's responses could still be preferable when they are perceived to be more authoritative, certain, well-articulated, or simply verbose. These variables interestingly fall under the broader category of language style, implying that the style in the LLM's responses might meaningfully influence users' preferences. This hypothesized dynamic could have double-edged consequences: enhancing the overall user experience while simultaneously increasing their susceptibility to risks such as LLM's misinformation or hallucinations. In this short paper, we present our preliminary studies in exploring this subject. Through a series of exploratory and experimental user studies, we found that LLM's language style does indeed influence user's preferences, but how and which language styles influence the preference varied across different user populations, and more interestingly, moderated by the user's very own individual traits. As a preliminary work, the findings in our studies should be interpreted with caution, particularly given the limitations in our samples, which still need wider demographic diversity and larger sample sizes. Our future directions will first aim to address these limitations, which would enable a more comprehensive joint effect analysis between the language style, individual traits, and preferences, and further investigate the potential causal relationship between and beyond these variables.",

    "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained prominence as an effective method for enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through the incorporation of external knowledge. However, the evaluation of RAG systems remains a challenge, due to the intricate interplay between retrieval and generation components. This limitation has resulted in a scarcity of benchmarks that facilitate a detailed, component-specific assessment. In this work, we present MIRAGE, a Question Answering dataset specifically designed for RAG evaluation. MIRAGE consists of 7,560 curated instances mapped to a retrieval pool of 37,800 entries, enabling an efficient and precise evaluation of both retrieval and generation tasks. We also introduce novel evaluation metrics aimed at measuring RAG adaptability, encompassing dimensions such as noise vulnerability, context acceptability, context insensitivity, and context misinterpretation. Through comprehensive experiments across various retriever-LLM configurations, we provide new insights into the optimal alignment of model pairs and the nuanced dynamics within RAG systems. The dataset and evaluation code are publicly available, allowing for seamless integration and customization in diverse research settings\\footnote{The MIRAGE code and data are available at this https URL.",

In the meantime, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into functional code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning, where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files; analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both model-based and human evaluations, specifically from the original paper authors, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality, faithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by substantial margins.",

In this work we propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based multi-agent LLM system to support analysis and decision-making in the context of natural hazards and extreme weather events. As a proof of concept, we present WildfireGPT, a specialized system focused on wildfire hazards. The architecture employs a user-centered, multi-agent design to deliver tailored risk insights across diverse stakeholder groups. By integrating natural hazard and extreme weather projection data, observational datasets, and scientific literature through an RAG framework, the system ensures both the accuracy and contextual relevance of the information it provides.

However, deploying large-scale LLMs introduces significant efficiency challenges, primarily high computational costs during fine-tuning and inference due to their massive parameterization. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a promising solution, transferring expertise from large teacher models to compact student models. This study systematically investigates knowledge distillation approaches for bundle generation, aiming to minimize computational demands while preserving performance. We explore three critical research questions: (1) how does the format of KD impact bundle generation performance? (2) to what extent does the quantity of distilled knowledge influence performance? and (3) how do different ways of utilizing the distilled knowledge affect performance? We propose a comprehensive KD framework that (i) progressively extracts knowledge (patterns, rules, deep thoughts); (ii) captures varying quantities of distilled knowledge through different strategies; and (iii) exploits complementary LLM adaptation techniques (in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, combination) to leverage distilled knowledge in small student models for domain-specific adaptation and enhanced efficiency. Extensive experiments provide valuable insights into how knowledge format, quantity, and utilization methodologies collectively shape LLM-based bundle generation performance, exhibiting KD's significant potential for more efficient yet effective LLM-based bundle generation.",

To address this gap, we propose CRDial, a novel framework for CR, which creates multi-turn dialogues with specifically designed identification and restructuring stages of negative thoughts, integrates sentence-level supportive conversation strategies, and adopts a multi-channel loop mechanism to enable iterative CR. With CRDial, we distill Crisp, a large-scale and high-quality bilingual dialogue dataset, from LLM. We then train Crispers, Crisp-based conversational LLMs for CR, at 7B and 14B scales.

However, there is growing concern that such AI systems may reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality of their performance in historically under-served populations. The fairness issue has attracted considerable research interest in the medical imaging classification field, yet it remains understudied in the text generation domain. In this study, we investigate the fairness problem in text generation within the medical field and observe significant performance discrepancies across different races, sexes, and age groups, including intersectional groups, various model scales, and different evaluation metrics. To mitigate this fairness issue, we propose an algorithm that selectively optimizes those underperformed groups to reduce bias. The selection rules take into account not only word-level accuracy but also the pathology accuracy to the target reference, while ensuring that the entire process remains fully differentiable for effective model training. Our evaluations across multiple backbones, datasets, and modalities demonstrate that our proposed algorithm enhances fairness in text generation without compromising overall performance. Specifically, the disparities among various groups across different metrics were diminished by more than 30% with our algorithm, while the relative change in text generation accuracy was typically within 2%. By reducing the bias generated by deep learning models, our proposed approach can potentially alleviate concerns about the fairness and reliability of text generation diagnosis in medical domain.\nOur code is publicly available to facilitate further research at this https URL.",

Additionally, we confirm that when compared to fine-tuned models, our proposal is less prone to data leak problems without hurting performance.

To bridge this gap, we construct the first spoken long-text dataset, derived from live streams, designed to reflect the redundancy-rich and conversational nature of real-world scenarios. We construct tasks in three categories: retrieval-dependent, reasoning-dependent, and hybrid. We then evaluate both popular LLMs and specialized methods to assess their ability to understand long-contexts in these tasks. Our results show that current methods exhibit strong task-specific preferences and perform poorly on highly redundant inputs, with no single method consistently outperforming others. We propose a new baseline that better handles redundancy in spoken text and achieves strong performance across tasks.

To address this, we introduce PicPersona-TOD, a novel dataset that incorporates user images as part of the persona, enabling personalized responses tailored to user-specific factors such as age or emotional context. This is facilitated by first impressions, dialogue policy-guided prompting, and the use of external knowledge to reduce hallucinations. Human evaluations confirm that our dataset enhances user experience, with personalized responses contributing to a more engaging interaction. Additionally, we introduce a new NLG model, Pictor, which not only personalizes responses, but also demonstrates robust performance across unseen domains this https URL.",

These methods overcome common concerns about reproducibility and costliness involved in the labor-intensive process of human qualitative analysis. However, two major limitations of topic models are their interpretability and their practicality for answering targeted, domain-specific social science research questions. In this work, we investigate opportunities for using LLM-generated text augmentation to improve the usefulness of topic modeling output. We use a political science case study to evaluate our results in a domain-specific application, and find that topic modeling using GPT-4 augmentations creates highly interpretable categories that can be used to investigate domain-specific research questions with minimal human guidance.",

    "summary": "Watermarking has emerged as a critical technique for combating misinformation and protecting intellectual property in large language models (LLMs). A recent discovery, termed watermark radioactivity, reveals that watermarks embedded in teacher models can be inherited by student models through knowledge distillation. On the positive side, this inheritance allows for the detection of unauthorized knowledge distillation by identifying watermark traces in student models. However, the robustness of watermarks against scrubbing attacks and their unforgeability in the face of spoofing attacks under unauthorized knowledge distillation remain largely unexplored. Existing watermark attack methods either assume access to model internals or fail to simultaneously support both scrubbing and spoofing attacks. In this work, we propose Contrastive Decoding-Guided Knowledge Distillation (CDG-KD), a unified framework that enables bidirectional attacks under unauthorized knowledge distillation. Our approach employs contrastive decoding to extract corrupted or amplified watermark texts via comparing outputs from the student model and weakly watermarked references, followed by bidirectional distillation to train new student models capable of watermark removal and watermark forgery, respectively. Extensive experiments show that CDG-KD effectively performs attacks while preserving the general performance of the distilled model. Our findings underscore critical need for developing watermarking schemes that are robust and unforgeable.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) often generate responses that deviate from user input or training data, a phenomenon known as \"hallucination.\" These hallucinations undermine user trust and hinder the adoption of generative AI systems. Addressing hallucinations is essential for the advancement of LLMs. This paper introduces a comprehensive hallucination benchmark, incorporating both new extrinsic and existing intrinsic evaluation tasks, built upon clear taxonomy of hallucination. A major challenge in benchmarking hallucinations is the lack of a unified framework due to inconsistent definitions and categorizations. We disentangle LLM hallucination from \"factuality,\" proposing a clear taxonomy that distinguishes between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucinations, to promote consistency and facilitate research. Extrinsic hallucinations, where the generated content is not consistent with the training data, are increasingly important as LLMs evolve. Our benchmark includes dynamic test set generation to mitigate data leakage and ensure robustness against such leakage. We also analyze existing benchmarks, highlighting their limitations and saturation. The work aims to: (1) establish a clear taxonomy of hallucinations, (2) introduce new extrinsic hallucination tasks, with data that can be dynamically regenerated to prevent saturation by leakage, (3) provide a comprehensive analysis of existing benchmarks, distinguishing them from factuality evaluations.",

    "summary": "The ability to acquire latent semantics is one of the key properties that determines the performance of language models. One convenient approach to invoke this ability is to prepend metadata (e.g. URLs, domains, and styles) at the beginning of texts in the pre-training data, making it easier for the model to access latent semantics before observing the entire text. Previous studies have reported that this technique actually improves the performance of trained models in downstream tasks; however, this improvement has been observed only in specific downstream tasks, without consistent enhancement in average next-token prediction loss. To understand this phenomenon, we closely investigate how prepending metadata during pre-training affects model performance by examining its behavior using artificial data. Interestingly, we found that this approach produces both positive and negative effects on the downstream tasks. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of the approach depends on whether latent semantics can be inferred from the downstream task's prompt. Specifically, through investigations using data generated by probabilistic context-free grammars, we show that training with metadata helps improve model's performance when the given context is long enough to infer the latent semantics. In contrast, the technique negatively impacts performance when the context lacks the necessary information to make an accurate posterior inference.",

    "summary": "Although large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance on various complex reasoning benchmarks, the academic community still lacks an in-depth understanding of base model training processes and data quality. To address this, we construct a large-scale, difficulty-graded reasoning dataset containing approximately 3.34 million unique queries of varying difficulty levels and about 40 million distilled responses generated by multiple models over several passes. Leveraging pass rate and Coefficient of Variation (CV), we precisely select the most valuable training data to enhance reasoning capability. Notably, we observe a training pattern shift, indicating that reasoning-focused training based on base models requires higher learning rates for effective training. Using this carefully selected data, we significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of the base model, achieving a pass rate of 79.2\\% on the AIME2024 mathematical reasoning benchmark. This result surpasses most current distilled models and closely approaches state-of-the-art performance. We provide detailed descriptions of our data processing, difficulty assessment, and training methodology, and have publicly released all datasets and methods to promote rapid progress in open-source long-reasoning LLMs. The dataset is available at: this https URL",

In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting an in-depth analysis of code-assisted LLMs' generated programs in response to math reasoning tasks. Our evaluation focuses on the extent to which LLMs ground their programs to math rules, and how that affects their end performance. For this purpose, we assess the generations of five different LLMs, on two different math datasets, both manually and automatically. Our results reveal that the distribution of grounding depends on LLMs' capabilities and the difficulty of math problems. Furthermore, mathematical grounding is more effective for closed-source models, while open-source models fail to employ math rules in their solutions correctly. On MATH500, the percentage of grounded programs decreased to half, while the ungrounded generations doubled in comparison to ASDiv grade-school problems. Our work highlights the need for in-depth evaluation beyond execution accuracy metrics, toward a better understanding of code-assisted LLMs' capabilities and limits in the math domain.",

    "summary": "This study addresses the critical challenge of hallucination mitigation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks through a Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) framework. While LVLMs excel in multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under user-defined risk levels ($\\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous control of \\textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain strictly below $\\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes inversely with $\\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces theoretical guarantees across all $\\alpha$ values. The framework achieves stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios, underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems, offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware decision-making.",

We introduce a modeling approach that approximates real-world LLM workflows through a binning strategy for input-output token distributions and batch size variations. Our empirical analysis spans software frameworks, decoding strategies, GPU architectures, online and offline serving settings, and model parallelism configurations. We show that the effectiveness of inference optimizations is highly sensitive to workload geometry, software stack, and hardware accelerators, demonstrating that naive energy estimates based on FLOPs or theoretical GPU utilization significantly underestimate real-world energy consumption. Our findings reveal that the proper application of relevant inference efficiency optimizations can reduce total energy use by up to 73% from unoptimized baselines.

To address this gap, we perform a careful comparison of training-free sparse attention methods at varying model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels on a diverse collection of long-sequence tasks-including novel ones that rely on natural language while remaining controllable and easy to evaluate. Based on our experiments, we report a series of key findings: 1) an isoFLOPS analysis reveals that for very long sequences, larger and highly sparse models are preferable to smaller and dense ones. 2) The level of sparsity attainable while statistically guaranteeing accuracy preservation is higher during decoding than prefilling, and correlates with model size in the former. 3) There is no clear strategy that performs best across tasks and phases, with different units of sparsification or budget adaptivity needed for different scenarios. Even moderate sparsity levels often result in significant performance degradation on at least one task, highlighting that sparse attention is not a universal solution. 4) We introduce and validate novel scaling laws specifically tailored for sparse attention, providing evidence that our findings are likely to hold true beyond our range of experiments. Through these insights, we demonstrate that sparse attention is a key tool to enhance the capabilities of Transformer LLMs for processing longer sequences, but requires careful evaluation of trade-offs for performance-sensitive applications.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled conversational AI from traditional dialogue systems into sophisticated agents capable of autonomous actions, contextual awareness, and multi-turn interactions with users. Yet, fundamental questions about their capabilities, limitations, and paths forward remain open. This survey paper presents a desideratum for next-generation Conversational Agents - what has been achieved, what challenges persist, and what must be done for more scalable systems that approach human-level intelligence. To that end, we systematically analyze LLM-driven Conversational Agents by organizing their capabilities into three primary dimensions: (i) Reasoning - logical, systematic thinking inspired by human intelligence for decision making, (ii) Monitor - encompassing self-awareness and user interaction monitoring, and (iii) Control - focusing on tool utilization and policy following. Building upon this, we introduce a novel taxonomy by classifying recent work on Conversational Agents around our proposed desideratum. We identify critical research gaps and outline key directions, including realistic evaluations, long-term multi-turn reasoning skills, self-evolution capabilities, collaborative and multi-agent task completion, personalization, and proactivity. This work aims to provide a structured foundation, highlight existing limitations, and offer insights into potential future research directions for Conversational Agents, ultimately advancing progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

    "summary": "Is automated hallucination detection possible? In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework to analyze the feasibility of automatically detecting hallucinations produced by large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the classical Gold-Angluin framework for language identification and its recent adaptation to language generation by Kleinberg and Mullainathan, we investigate whether an algorithm, trained on examples drawn from an unknown target language $K$ (selected from a countable collection) and given access to an LLM, can reliably determine whether the LLM's outputs are correct or constitute hallucinations.\nFirst, we establish an equivalence between hallucination detection and the classical task of language identification. We prove that any hallucination detection method can be converted into a language identification method, and conversely, algorithms solving language identification can be adapted for hallucination detection. Given the inherent difficulty of language identification, this implies that hallucination detection is fundamentally impossible for most language collections if the detector is trained using only correct examples from the target language.\nSecond, we show that the use of expert-labeled feedback, i.e., training the detector with both positive examples (correct statements) and negative examples (explicitly labeled incorrect statements), dramatically changes this conclusion. Under this enriched training regime, automated hallucination detection becomes possible for all countable language collections.\nThese results highlight the essential role of expert-labeled examples in training hallucination detectors and provide theoretical support for feedback-based methods, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which have proven critical for reliable LLM deployment.",

    "summary": "Soccer is a globally popular sporting event, typically characterized by long matches and distinctive highlight moments. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising capabilities in temporal grounding and video understanding, soccer commentary generation often requires precise temporal localization and semantically rich descriptions over long-form video. However, existing soccer MLLMs often rely on the temporal a priori for caption generation, so they cannot process the soccer video end-to-end. While some traditional approaches follow a two-step paradigm that is complex and fails to capture the global context to achieve suboptimal performance. To solve the above issues, we present TimeSoccer, the first end-to-end soccer MLLM for Single-anchor Dense Video Captioning (SDVC) in full-match soccer videos. TimeSoccer jointly predicts timestamps and generates captions in a single pass, enabling global context modeling across 45-minute matches. To support long video understanding of soccer matches, we introduce MoFA-Select, a training-free, motion-aware frame compression module that adaptively selects representative frames via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and incorporates complementary training paradigms to strengthen the model's ability to handle long temporal sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TimeSoccer achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on the SDVC task in an end-to-end form, generating high-quality commentary with accurate temporal alignment and strong semantic relevance.",

To address this, we introduce HMI, a Hierarchical knowledge management-based Multi-tenant Inference system, designed to manage tenants with distinct PLMs resource-efficiently. Our approach is three-fold: Firstly, we categorize PLM knowledge into general, domain-specific, and task-specific. Leveraging insights on knowledge acquisition across different model layers, we construct hierarchical PLMs (hPLMs) by extracting and storing knowledge at different levels, significantly reducing GPU memory usage per tenant. Secondly, we establish hierarchical knowledge management for hPLMs generated by various tenants in HMI. We manage domain-specific knowledge with acceptable storage increases by constructing and updating domain-specific knowledge trees based on frequency. We manage task-specific knowledge within limited GPU memory through parameter swapping. Finally, we propose system optimizations to enhance resource utilization and inference throughput. These include fine-grained pipelining via hierarchical knowledge prefetching to overlap CPU and I/O operations with GPU computations, and optimizing parallel implementations with batched matrix multiplications. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HMI can efficiently serve up to 10,000 hPLMs (hBERTs and hGPTs) on a single GPU, with only a negligible compromise in accuracy.",

    "summary": "Abstractive dialogue summarization is the task of distilling conversations into informative and concise summaries. Although reviews have been conducted on this topic, there is a lack of comprehensive work detailing the challenges of dialogue summarization, unifying the differing understanding of the task, and aligning proposed techniques, datasets, and evaluation metrics with the challenges. This article summarizes the research on Transformer-based abstractive summarization for English dialogues by systematically reviewing 1262 unique research papers published between 2019 and 2024, relying on the Semantic Scholar and DBLP databases. We cover the main challenges present in dialog summarization (i.e., language, structure, comprehension, speaker, salience, and factuality) and link them to corresponding techniques such as graph-based approaches, additional training tasks, and planning strategies, which typically overly rely on BART-based encoder-decoder models. We find that while some challenges, like language, have seen considerable progress, mainly due to training methods, others, such as comprehension, factuality, and salience, remain difficult and hold significant research opportunities. We investigate how these approaches are typically assessed, covering the datasets for the subdomains of dialogue (e.g., meeting, medical), the established automatic metrics and human evaluation approaches for assessing scores and annotator agreement. We observe that only a few datasets span across all subdomains. The ROUGE metric is the most used, while human evaluation is frequently reported without sufficient detail on inner-annotator agreement and annotation guidelines. Additionally, we discuss the possible implications of the recently explored large language models and conclude that despite a potential shift in relevance and difficulty, our described challenge taxonomy remains relevant.",

These advances provide valuable tools for artists and enhance their creative processes, but they also raise concerns about copyright violations, consumer satisfaction, and content spamming. Previous research has explored content detection in various domains. However, no work has focused on the text modality, lyrics, in music. To address this gap, we curated a diverse dataset of real and synthetic lyrics from multiple languages, music genres, and artists. The generation pipeline was validated using both humans and automated methods. We performed a thorough evaluation of existing synthetic text detection approaches on lyrics, a previously unexplored data type. We also investigated methods to adapt the best-performing features to lyrics through unsupervised domain adaptation. Following both music and industrial constraints, we examined how well these approaches generalize across languages, scale with data availability, handle multilingual language content, and perform on novel genres in few-shot settings. Our findings show promising results that could inform policy decisions around AI-generated music and enhance transparency for users.",

    "summary": "Autoregressive language models demonstrate excellent performance in various scenarios. However, the inference efficiency is limited by its one-step-one-word generation mode, which has become a pressing problem recently as the models become increasingly larger. Speculative decoding employs a \"draft and then verify\" mechanism to allow multiple tokens to be generated in one step, realizing lossless acceleration. Existing methods mainly adopt fixed heuristic draft structures, which fail to adapt to different situations to maximize the acceptance length during verification. To alleviate this dilemma, we proposed OPT-Tree, an algorithm to construct adaptive and scalable draft trees. It searches the optimal tree structure that maximizes the mathematical expectation of the acceptance length in each decoding step. Experimental results reveal that OPT-Tree outperforms the existing draft structures and achieves a speed-up ratio of up to 3.2 compared with autoregressive decoding. If the draft model is powerful enough and the node budget is sufficient, it can generate more than ten tokens in a single step. Our code is available at this https URL.",

The skeptical thinking of humankind could be useful for LLMs to self-cognition, self-reflection and alleviate their hallucinations. Inspired by this consideration, we propose a novel approach called LaMsS, which combines the semantic understanding capability of LLMs with self-skepticism. By introducing a series of skepticism tokens and augmenting them into the vocabulary, we conduct both pertaining and finetuning, which allow the LLM to decode each normal token followed by a skeptical token, representing different skepticism levels. By calculating the response skepticism given a query, one can define a new self-aware LLM which is only willing to answer with relative lower skepticism level than the threshold. By examining the accuracy, AUC and AP of willingly answering questions, we demonstrate that LaMsS achieves better performance than baselines on both multi-choice questions and open-domain question-answering benchmarks, and can generalize to multi-task and out-of-domain settings. Our study sheds some lights on the self-skepticism modeling on further artificial intelligence. Project code and model checkpoints can be found in this https URL.",

Machine Translation from One Book (Tanzer et al., 2024) suggests that prompting long-context LLMs with one grammar book enables English-Kalamang translation, an XLR language unseen by LLMs - a noteworthy case of linguistics helping an NLP task. We investigate the source of this translation ability, finding almost all improvements stem from the book's parallel examples rather than its grammatical explanations. We find similar results for Nepali and Guarani, seen low-resource languages, and we achieve performance comparable to an LLM with a grammar book by simply fine-tuning an encoder-decoder translation model. We then investigate where grammar books help by testing two linguistic tasks, grammaticality judgment and gloss prediction, and we explore what kind of grammatical knowledge helps by introducing a typological feature prompt that achieves leading results on these more relevant tasks. We thus emphasise the importance of task-appropriate data for XLR languages: parallel examples for translation, and grammatical data for linguistic tasks. As we find no evidence that long-context LLMs can make effective use of grammatical explanations for XLR translation, we conclude data collection for multilingual XLR tasks such as translation is best focused on parallel data over linguistic description.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in solving complex problems. However, current approaches primarily enhance reasoning through the elaboration of thoughts while neglecting the diversity of reasoning types. LLMs typically employ deductive reasoning, proceeding step-by-step from given conditions, which limits their exploration during problem-solving. Our analysis reveals that certain problems are exclusively solvable through specific reasoning strategies like inductive, abductive, or analogical reasoning. However, incorporating diverse reasoning approaches presents two key challenges: identifying the appropriate reasoning type for each problem and exploiting this approach during problem-solving. Therefore, we propose the TypedThinker that predicts suitable reasoning types based on the problem and their previous effectiveness and provides relevant demonstrations to guide LLMs in applying these strategies. Experimental results show significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, with performance gains of 3.4% for Mistral 7B, 6.5% for LLaMA3 8B, and 7% for Qwen 2 7B on logical and mathematical reasoning tasks. TypedThinker enhances LLM reasoning without requiring knowledge distillation from larger models.

We introduce Selective Attention, a simple parameter-free change to the standard attention mechanism which reduces attention to unneeded elements. Selective attention consistently improves language modeling and downstream task performance in a variety of model sizes and context lengths. For example, transformers trained with the language modeling objective on C4 with selective attention perform language modeling equivalently to standard transformers with ~2X more heads and parameters in their attention modules. Selective attention also allows decreasing the size of the attention's context buffer, leading to meaningful reductions in the memory and compute requirements during inference. For example, transformers trained on C4 with context sizes of 512, 1,024, and 2,048 need 16X, 25X, and 47X less memory for their attention module, respectively, when equipped with selective attention, as those without selective attention, with the same validation perplexity.",

    "summary": "Climate change communication on social media increasingly employs microtargeting strategies to effectively reach and influence specific demographic groups. This study presents a post-hoc analysis of microtargeting practices within climate campaigns by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to examine Facebook advertisements. Our analysis focuses on two key aspects: demographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age group, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.55%. Furthermore, we instruct the LLMs to generate explanations for their classifications, providing transparent reasoning behind each decision. These explanations reveal the specific thematic elements used to engage different demographic segments, highlighting distinct strategies tailored to various audiences. Our findings show that young adults are primarily targeted through messages emphasizing activism and environmental consciousness, while women are engaged through themes related to caregiving roles and social advocacy. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting microtargeted messaging, we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis to identify potential biases in model predictions. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist, particularly in the classification of senior citizens and male audiences. By showcasing the efficacy of LLMs in dissecting and explaining targeted communication strategies and by highlighting fairness concerns, this study provides a valuable framework for future research aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in social media-driven climate campaigns.",

    "summary": "The large models, as predicted by scaling raw forecasts, have made groundbreaking progress in many fields, particularly in natural language generation tasks, where they have approached or even surpassed human levels. However, the unprecedented scale of their parameters brings significant computational and storage costs. These large models require substantial computational resources and GPU memory to operate. When adapting large models to specific downstream tasks, their massive parameter scale poses a significant challenge in fine-tuning on hardware platforms with limited computational power and GPU memory. To address this issue, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) offers a practical solution by efficiently adjusting the parameters of large pre-trained models to suit various downstream tasks. Specifically, PEFT adjusts the parameters of pre-trained large models to adapt to specific tasks or domains, minimizing the introduction of additional parameters and the computational resources required. This review mainly introduces the preliminary knowledge of PEFT, the core ideas and principles of various PEFT algorithms, the applications of PEFT, and potential future research directions. By reading this review, we believe that interested parties can quickly grasp the PEFT methodology, thereby accelerating its development and innovation.",

    "summary": "We introduce a data-centric hypothesis-testing framework to quantify the influence of sequentially correlated literary properties--such as thematic continuity--on textual classification tasks. Our method models label sequences as stochastic processes and uses an empirical autocovariance matrix to generate surrogate labelings that preserve sequential dependencies. This enables statistical testing to determine whether classification outcomes are primarily driven by thematic structure or by non-sequential features like authorial style. Applying this framework across a diverse corpus of English prose, we compare traditional (word n-grams and character k-mers) and neural (contrastively trained) embeddings in both supervised and unsupervised classification settings. Crucially, our method identifies when classifications are confounded by sequentially correlated similarity, revealing that supervised and neural models are more prone to false positives--mistaking shared themes and cross-genre differences for stylistic signals. In contrast, unsupervised models using traditional features often yield high true positive rates with minimal false positives, especially in genre-consistent settings. By disentangling sequential from non-sequential influences, our approach provides a principled way to assess and interpret classification reliability. This is particularly impactful for authorship attribution, forensic linguistics, and the analysis of redacted or composite texts, where conventional methods may conflate theme with style. Our results demonstrate that controlling for sequential correlation is essential for reducing false positives and ensuring that classification outcomes reflect genuine stylistic distinctions.",

    "summary": "Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has been widely used for crossmodal information retrieval and multimodal understanding tasks. However, CLIP models are mainly optimized for crossmodal vision-language tasks and underperform in single-mode text tasks. Moreover, these models are often trained on English datasets and therefore lack multilingual understanding. Additionally, from a visual understanding perspective, previous CLIP-based models exhibit insufficient understanding of visually rich documents. In this work, we propose jina-clip-v2, a contrastive vision-language model trained on text pairs, triplets and image-text pairs via a multi-task and multi-stage contrastive learning paradigm in order to support both text-only and crossmodal tasks. We employ a multilingual text encoder and expand the training dataset to include multilingual texts from 29 non-English languages, including Hindi, Chinese, German, French, and others, as well as images of visually rich documents. We evaluate the model's performance and show that jina-clip-v2 achieves notable improvements over state-of-the-art CLIP-based models in zero-shot text-only retrieval, semantic textual similarity, and crossmodal retrieval tasks in both English and multilingual settings. jina-clip-v2 also provides for flexibility in embedding dimensionality, enabling users to select the granularity of the representations. jina-clip-v2 is publicly available at this https URL.",

    "summary": "The integration of contextual embeddings into the optimization processes of large language models is an advancement in natural language processing. The Context-Aware Neural Gradient Mapping framework introduces a dynamic gradient adjustment mechanism, incorporating contextual embeddings directly into the optimization process. This approach facilitates real-time parameter adjustments, enhancing task-specific generalization even in the presence of sparse or noisy data inputs. The mathematical foundation of this framework relies on gradient descent modifications, where contextual embeddings are derived from a supplementary neural network trained to map input features to optimal adaptation gradients. By employing differential geometry principles, high-dimensional input dependencies are encoded into low-dimensional gradient manifolds, enabling efficient adaptation without necessitating the retraining of the entire model. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline models across various metrics, including accuracy, robustness to noise, and computational efficiency. The integration of context-specific embeddings allows for a more complex understanding of language, thereby improving the model's ability to handle diverse linguistic phenomena. Furthermore, the computational efficiency achieved through this method demonstrates its scalability for large-scale language models operating under diverse constraints.",

SSMs are particularly suited for this task due to their ability to model long-term and short-term dependencies in sequential data, making them well-equipped to handle the rich morphology, complex syntax, and contextual intricacies characteristic of Indian languages. We evaluated multiple SSM architectures across diverse datasets representing various Indic languages and conducted a comparative analysis of their performance. Our results demonstrate that these models effectively capture linguistic subtleties, leading to significant improvements in question interpretation, context alignment, and answer generation. This work represents the first application of SSMs to question answering tasks in Indic languages, establishing a foundational benchmark for future research in this domain. We propose enhancements to existing SSM frameworks, optimizing their applicability to low-resource settings and multilingual scenarios prevalent in Indic languages.",

Comparative evaluations demonstrate that probabilistic embeddings improve neighborhood consistency and decrease redundancy, ensuring that token relationships remain more structurally coherent across fine-tuning iterations. The integration of probabilistic subspaces within attention mechanisms facilitates more adaptive contextual weighting, enabling models to capture latent dependencies that would otherwise be obscured in conventional embeddings. Experimental results highlight increased robustness against adversarial modifications, with probabilistic embeddings preserving contextual integrity even under perturbation-based evaluation scenarios. Performance assessments indicate that probabilistic representations achieve greater adaptability in domain-specific applications, mitigating the need for extensive retraining when shifting across linguistic domains. Computational trade-offs remain within operationally feasible limits, with marginal increases in inference latency balanced against the benefits of enhanced representation stability and contextual expressiveness. The capacity to encode structured uncertainty provides advantages in generative modeling tasks, particularly where maintaining coherence across extended sequences requires a representation framework capable of handling ambiguous or context-dependent linguistic constructs.",

    "summary": "Reasoning has long been viewed as an emergent property of large language models (LLMs), appearing at or above a certain scale ($\\sim$100B parameters). However, recent studies challenge this assumption, showing that small language models (SLMs) can also achieve competitive reasoning performance. SLMs are increasingly favored for their efficiency and deployability. However, there is a lack of systematic study on the reasoning abilities of diverse SLMs, including those trained from scratch or derived from LLMs through quantization, pruning, and distillation. This raises a critical question: Can SLMs achieve reasoning abilities comparable to LLMs? In this work, we systematically survey, benchmark, and analyze 72 SLMs from six model families across 14 reasoning benchmarks. For reliable evaluation, we examine four evaluation methods and compare four LLM judges against human evaluations on 800 data points. We repeat all experiments three times to ensure a robust performance assessment. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different prompting strategies in small models. Beyond accuracy, we also evaluate model robustness under adversarial conditions and intermediate reasoning steps. Our findings challenge the assumption that scaling is the only way to achieve strong reasoning. Instead, we foresee a future where SLMs with strong reasoning capabilities can be developed through structured training or post-training compression. They can serve as efficient alternatives to LLMs for reasoning-intensive tasks.",

In this paper, we propose a CPS data collection protocol and create a new CPS dataset, called PSCon, which assists product search through conversations with human-like language. The dataset is collected by a coached human-human data collection protocol and is available for dual markets and two languages. By formulating the task of CPS, the dataset allows for comprehensive and in-depth research on six subtasks: user intent detection, keyword extraction, system action prediction, question selection, item ranking, and response generation. Moreover, we present a concise analysis of the dataset and propose a benchmark model on the proposed CPS dataset. Our proposed dataset and model will be helpful for facilitating future research on CPS.",

To address the challenge, we developed an automatic evaluation pipeline to assess the LLMs' paper review capability by comparing them with expert-generated reviews. By constructing a dataset consisting of 676 OpenReview papers, we examined the agreement between LLMs and experts in their strength and weakness identifications. The results showed that LLMs lack balanced perspectives, significantly overlook novelty assessment when criticizing, and produce poor acceptance decisions.

To address this, we present HyperDAS, a transformer-based hypernetwork architecture that (1) automatically locates the token-positions of the residual stream that a concept is realized in and (2) constructs features of those residual stream vectors for the concept. In experiments with Llama3-8B, HyperDAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the RAVEL benchmark for disentangling concepts in hidden states. In addition, we review the design decisions we made to mitigate the concern that HyperDAS (like all powerful interpretabilty methods) might inject new information into the target model rather than faithfully interpreting it.",

First, we find ``global'' similarities: token embeddings often share similar relative orientations. Next, we characterize local geometry in two ways: (1) by using Locally Linear Embeddings, and (2) by defining a simple measure for the intrinsic dimension of each token embedding. Our intrinsic dimension demonstrates that token embeddings lie on a lower dimensional manifold. We qualitatively show that tokens with lower intrinsic dimensions often have semantically coherent clusters, while those with higher intrinsic dimensions do not. Both characterizations allow us to find similarities in the local geometry of token embeddings. Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that alignment in token embeddings persists through the hidden states of language models, allowing us to develop an application for interpretability. Namely, we introduce Emb2Emb, a simple method to transfer steering vectors from one language model to another, despite the two models having different dimensions.",

It categorizes memory into sensory, short-term, and long-term, with sensory memory corresponding to input prompts, short-term memory processing immediate context, and long-term memory implemented via external databases or structures. The text-based memory section covers acquisition (selection and summarization), management (updating, accessing, storing, and resolving conflicts), and utilization (full-text search, SQL queries, semantic search). The KV cache-based memory section discusses selection methods (regularity-based summarization, score-based approaches, special token embeddings) and compression techniques (low-rank compression, KV merging, multimodal compression), along with management strategies like offloading and shared attention mechanisms. Parameter-based memory methods (LoRA, TTT, MoE) transform memories into model parameters to enhance efficiency, while hidden-state-based memory approaches (chunk mechanisms, recurrent transformers, Mamba model) improve long-text processing by combining RNN hidden states with current methods. Overall, the paper offers a comprehensive analysis of LLM memory mechanisms, highlighting their significance and future research directions.",

In the context of large language models (LLMs), unlearning has recently received increased attention, particularly for removing knowledge about named entities from models for privacy purposes. While various approaches have been proposed to address the unlearning problem, most existing approaches treat all data points to be unlearned equally, i.e., unlearning that Montreal is a city in Canada is treated exactly the same as unlearning the phone number of the first author of this paper. In this work, we show that this all data is equal assumption does not hold for LLM unlearning. We study how the success of unlearning depends on the frequency of the knowledge we want to unlearn in the pre-training data of a model and find that frequency strongly affects unlearning, i.e., more frequent knowledge is harder to unlearn. Additionally, we uncover a misalignment between probability and generation-based evaluations of unlearning and show that this problem worsens as models become larger. Overall, our experiments highlight the need for better evaluation practices and novel methods for LLM unlearning that take the training data of models into account.",

    "summary": "In the realm of large language model (LLM), as the size of large models increases, it also brings higher training costs. There is a urgent need to minimize the data size in LLM training. Compared with data selection method, the data distillation method aims to synthesize a small number of data samples to achieve the training effect of the full data set and has better flexibility. Despite its successes in computer vision, the discreteness of text data has hitherto stymied its exploration in natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we proposed a method that involves learning pseudo prompt data based on trajectory matching and finding its nearest neighbor ID to achieve cross-architecture transfer. During the distillation process, we introduce a regularization loss to improve the robustness of our distilled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first data distillation work suitable for text generation tasks such as instruction tuning. Evaluations on two benchmarks, including ARC-Easy and MMLU instruction tuning datasets, established the superiority of our distillation approach over the SOTA data selection method LESS. Furthermore, our method demonstrates a good transferability over LLM structures (i.e., OPT to Llama).",

Humans exhibit strong reasoning ability in this task through accurate identification and adaptive application of geometric principles within visual contexts. However, existing benchmarks fail to jointly assess both dimensions of the human-like geometric reasoning mechanism in MLLMs, remaining a critical gap in assessing their ability to tackle GPS. To this end, we introduce GeoSense, the first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the geometric reasoning abilities of MLLMs through the lens of geometric principles. GeoSense features a five-level hierarchical framework of geometric principles spanning plane and solid geometry, an intricately annotated dataset of 1,789 problems, and an innovative evaluation strategy. Through extensive experiments on GeoSense with various open-source and closed-source MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.0-pro-flash performs best, achieving an overall score of $65.3$. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the identification and application of geometric principles remain a bottleneck for leading MLLMs, jointly hindering their reasoning abilities. These findings underscore GeoSense's potential to guide future advancements in MLLMs' geometric reasoning capabilities, paving the way for more robust and human-like reasoning in artificial intelligence.",

    "summary": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence by optimizing traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines, improving performance and generalization. This has spurred their integration into various systems. Many NLP systems, including ours, employ a \"one-stage\" pipeline directly incorporating LLMs. While effective, this approach incurs substantial costs and latency due to the need for large model parameters to achieve satisfactory outcomes. This paper introduces a three-stage cost-efficient end-to-end LLM deployment pipeline-including prototyping, knowledge transfer, and model compression-to tackle the cost-performance dilemma in LLM-based frameworks. Our approach yields a super tiny model optimized for cost and performance in online systems, simplifying the system architecture. Initially, by transforming complex tasks into a function call-based LLM-driven pipeline, an optimal performance prototype system is constructed to produce high-quality data as a teacher model. The second stage combines techniques like rejection fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge to a smaller 0.5B student model, delivering effective performance at minimal cost. The final stage applies quantization and pruning to extremely compress models to 0.4B, achieving ultra-low latency and cost. The framework's modular design and cross-domain capabilities suggest potential applicability in other NLP areas.",

By retaining only the KV cache of original tokens for long-range dependencies while immediately discarding hidden decoding tokens after use, our approach maintains the same KV cache size as the vanilla transformer while enabling effective length scaling. To further enhance performance, we introduce two optimized variants: \\textit{PHD-SWA} employs sliding window attention to preserve local dependencies, while \\textit{PHD-CSWA} implements chunk-wise sliding window attention to eliminate linear growth in pre-filling time.

Despite its significance, little research has investigated the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to comprehend cognitive-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce MMLA, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to address this gap. MMLA comprises over 61K multimodal utterances drawn from both staged and real-world scenarios, covering six core dimensions of multimodal semantics: intent, emotion, dialogue act, sentiment, speaking style, and communication behavior. We evaluate eight mainstream branches of LLMs and MLLMs using three methods: zero-shot inference, supervised fine-tuning, and instruction tuning. Extensive experiments reveal that even fine-tuned models achieve only about 60%~70% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current MLLMs in understanding complex human language. We believe that MMLA will serve as a solid foundation for exploring the potential of large language models in multimodal language analysis and provide valuable resources to advance this field.

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for empowering large language model (LLM) applications. Compared with the supervised training process of LLMs, the RLHF training process is much more sophisticated, requiring a diverse range of computation workloads with intricate dependencies between multiple LLM instances. Therefore, simply adopting the fixed parallelization strategies from supervised training for LLMs can be insufficient for RLHF and result in low training efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel technique named parameter ReaLlocation, which dynamically adapts the parallelization strategies for different workloads during training by redistributing LLM parameters across the training cluster. Building upon this idea, we introduce ReaL, a pioneering system for efficient RLHF training. ReaL introduces the concept of an execution plan, which defines a fine-grained resource allocation and parallelization strategy particularly designed for RLHF training. Based on this concept, ReaL employs a tailored search algorithm with a lightweight run-time estimator to automatically discover an efficient execution plan for an instance of RLHF experiment. Subsequently, the runtime engine deploys the selected plan by effectively parallelizing computations and redistributing parameters. We evaluate ReaL on the LLaMA models with up to 70 billion parameters and 128 GPUs. The experimental results demonstrate that ReaL achieves speedups of up to $3.58\\times$ compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, the execution plans generated by ReaL exhibit an average of $81\\%$ performance improvement over heuristic approaches based on Megatron-LM in the long-context scenario. The source code of ReaL is publicly available at this https URL .",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success at tasks like summarization that involve a single turn of interaction. However, they can still struggle with multi-turn tasks like dialogue that require long-term planning. Previous works on multi-turn dialogue extend single-turn reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods to the multi-turn setting by treating all prior dialogue turns as a long context. Such approaches suffer from covariate shift: the conversations in the training set have previous turns generated by some reference policy, which means that low training error may not necessarily correspond to good performance when the learner is actually in the conversation loop. In response, we introduce REgressing the RELative FUture (REFUEL), an efficient policy optimization approach designed to address multi-turn RLHF in LLMs. REFUEL employs a single model to estimate $Q$-values and trains on self-generated data, addressing the covariate shift issue. REFUEL frames the multi-turn RLHF problem as a sequence of regression tasks on iteratively collected datasets, enabling ease of implementation. Theoretically, we prove that REFUEL can match the performance of any policy covered by the training set. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm by using Llama-3.1-70B-it to simulate a user in conversation with our model. REFUEL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as DPO and REBEL across various settings. Furthermore, despite having only 8 billion parameters, Llama-3-8B-it fine-tuned with REFUEL outperforms Llama-3.1-70B-it on long multi-turn dialogues. Implementation of REFUEL can be found at this https URL, and models trained by REFUEL can be found at this https URL.",

For example, if someone learns ( B = f(A) ) from one source and ( C = g(B) ) from another, they can deduce ( C=g(B)=g(f(A)) ) even without encountering ( ABC ) together, showcasing the generalization ability of human intelligence. In this paper, we introduce a synthetic learning task, \"FTCT\" (Fragmented at Training, Chained at Testing), to validate the potential of Transformers in replicating this skill and interpret its inner mechanism. In the training phase, data consist of separated knowledge fragments from an overall causal graph. During testing, Transformers must infer complete causal graph traces by integrating these fragments. Our findings demonstrate that few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting enables Transformers to perform compositional reasoning on FTCT by revealing correct combinations of fragments, even if such combinations were absent in the training data. Furthermore, the emergence of compositional reasoning ability is strongly correlated with the model complexity and training-testing data similarity. We propose, both theoretically and empirically, that Transformers learn an underlying generalizable program from training, enabling effective compositional reasoning during testing.",

However, they often incur substantial computational overhead due to redundant visual information, particularly in long-form video scenarios.

In this work, we propose KVTP (Keyframe-oriented Vision Token Pruning), a novel framework that overcomes the drawbacks of token pruning and keyframe selection. By adaptively assigning pruning rates based on frame relevance to the query, KVTP effectively retains essential contextual information while significantly reducing redundant computation. To thoroughly evaluate the long-form video understanding capacities of VLMs, we curated and reorganized subsets from VideoMME, EgoSchema, and NextQA into a unified benchmark named SparseKV-QA that highlights real-world scenarios with sparse but crucial events. Our experiments with VLMs of various scales show that KVTP can reduce token usage by 80% without compromising spatiotemporal and contextual consistency, significantly cutting computation while maintaining the performance. These results demonstrate our approach's effectiveness in efficient long-video processing, facilitating more scalable VLM deployment.",

This contrasts with humans' natural writing and reasoning process, where goals are typically known before the exact argument or phrasings.

We argue that rearranging and processing the training data sequences can allow models to more accurately imitate the true data-generating process, and does not require any other changes to the architecture or training infrastructure. We demonstrate that this technique, Trelawney, and the inference algorithms derived from it allow us to improve performance on several key benchmarks that span planning, algorithmic reasoning, and story generation tasks.

However, this approach significantly increases computational costs and inference time, as the model must generate and evaluate multiple candidate solutions to identify a viable reasoning path. To address this, we propose an effective approach that integrates search capabilities directly into the model by fine-tuning it using both successful (learning) and failed reasoning paths (forgetting) derived from diverse search methods. While fine-tuning the model with these data might seem straightforward, we identify a critical issue: the model's search capability tends to degrade rapidly if fine-tuning is performed naively. We show that this degradation can be substantially mitigated by employing a smaller learning rate. Extensive experiments on the challenging Game-of-24 and Countdown mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our approach not only outperforms both standard fine-tuning and inference-time search baselines but also significantly reduces inference time by 180$\\times$.",

    "summary": "Modern password hashing remains a critical defense against credential cracking, yet the transition from theoretically secure algorithms to robust real-world implementations remains fraught with challenges. This paper presents a dual analysis of Argon2, the Password Hashing Competition winner, combining attack simulations quantifying how parameter configurations impact guessing costs under realistic budgets, with the first large-scale empirical study of Argon2 adoption across public GitHub software repositories. Our economic model, validated against cryptocurrency mining benchmarks, demonstrates that OWASP's recommended 46 MiB configuration reduces compromise rates by 42.5% compared to SHA-256 at \\$1/account attack budgets for strong user passwords. However, memory-hardness exhibits diminishing returns as increasing allocations to RFC 9106's 2048 MiB provides just 23.3% (\\$1) and 17.7% (\\$20) additional protection despite 44.5 times greater memory demands. Crucially, both configurations fail to mitigate risks from weak passwords, with 96.9-99.8% compromise rates for RockYou-like credentials regardless of algorithm choice. Our repository analysis shows accelerating Argon2 adoption, yet weak configuration practices: 46.6% of deployments use weaker-than-OWASP parameters. Surprisingly, sensitive applications (password managers, encryption tools) show no stronger configurations than general software. Our findings highlight that a secure algorithm alone cannot ensure security, effective parameter guidance and developer education remain essential for realizing Argon2's theoretical advantages.",

    "summary": "In this work, we propose a joint design of encoding and encryption processes for KEMs like Kyber, without assuming the independence of the decoding noise entries. Our design features two techniques: ciphertext packing and lattice packing. First, we extend the Peikert-Vaikuntanathan-Waters (PVW) method to the Kyber: $\\ell$ plaintexts are packed into a single ciphertext. This scheme is referred to as P$_\\ell$-Kyber. We prove that the P$_\\ell$-Kyber is IND-CCA secure under the M-LWE hardness assumption. We show that the decryption decoding noise entries across the $\\ell$ plaintexts (also known as layers) are mutually independent. Second, we propose a cross-layer lattice encoding scheme for the P$_\\ell$-Kyber, where every $\\ell$ cross-layer information symbols are encoded to a lattice point. This way we obtain a \\emph{coded} P$_\\ell$-Kyber, where the decoding noise entries for each lattice point are mutually independent. Therefore, the decryption failure rate (DFR) analysis does not require the assumption of independence among the decryption decoding noise entries. Both DFR and communication cost (CER) are greatly decreased thanks to ciphertext packing and lattice packing. Finally, we demonstrate that with $\\ell=24$ and Leech lattice encoder, the proposed coded P$_\\ell$-KYBER1024 achieves DFR $<2^{-281}$ and CER $ = 4.6$, i.e., a decrease of CER by $90\\%$ compared to KYBER1024.",

Traditional centralized systems, while widely adopted, suffer from vulnerabilities such as single points of failure and limited traceability of unauthorized access. This paper presents a blockchain-based secure digital content distribution system that integrates Sia, a decentralized storage network, and Skynet, a content delivery network, to enhance content protection and distribution. The proposed system employs a dual-layer architecture: off-chain for user authentication and on-chain for transaction validation using smart contracts and asymmetric encryption. By introducing a license issuance and secret block mechanism, the system ensures content authenticity, privacy, and controlled access. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the system in securely distributing multimedia files. The proposed platform not only improves content security but also paves the way for future enhancements with decentralized applications and integrated royalty payment mechanisms.",

Given that touchscreens are the primary medium for human-device interaction, continuous user authentication based on touch behavior presents a natural and seamless security solution. While existing methods predominantly adopt binary classification under single-modal learning settings, we propose a unified contrastive learning framework for continuous authentication in a non-disruptive manner. Specifically, the proposed method leverages a Temporal Masked Autoencoder to extract temporal patterns from raw multi-sensor data streams, capturing continuous motion and gesture dynamics. The pre-trained TMAE is subsequently integrated into a Siamese Temporal-Attentive Convolutional Network within a contrastive learning paradigm to model both sequential and cross-modal patterns. To further enhance performance, we incorporate multi-head attention and channel attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and optimize inter-channel feature integration. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and a self-collected dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a reliable and effective solution for user authentication on mobile devices.",

Significant research has been done into the security of browsers themselves, but relatively little investigation has been done into how they interact with the operating system or the file system. In this work, we provide the first systematic security study of browser profiles, the on-disk persistence layer of browsers, used for storing everything from users' authentication cookies and browser extensions to certificate trust decisions and device permissions. We show that, except for the Tor Browser, all modern browsers store sensitive data in home directories with little to no integrity or confidentiality controls. We show that security measures like password and cookie encryption can be easily bypassed. In addition, HTTPS can be sidestepped entirely by deploying malicious root certificates within users' browser profiles. The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), the backbone of the secure Web. HTTPS can be fully bypassed with the deployment of custom potentially malicious root certificates. More worryingly, we show how these powerful attacks can be fully mounted directly from web browsers themselves, through the File System Access API, a recent feature added by Chromium browsers that enables a website to directly manipulate a user's file system via JavaScript. In a series of case studies, we demonstrate how an attacker can install malicious browser extensions, inject additional root certificates, hijack HTTPS traffic, and enable websites to access hardware devices like the camera and GPS. Based on our findings, we argue that researchers and browser vendors need to develop and deploy more secure mechanisms for protecting users' browser data against file system attackers.",

    "summary": "Outsourcing the ML training to cloud providers presents a compelling opportunity for resource constrained clients, while it simultaneously bears inherent privacy risks, especially for highly sensitive training data. We introduce Silenzio, the first fully non-interactive outsourcing scheme for the training of multi-layer perceptrons that achieves 128 bit security using FHE. Unlike traditional MPC based protocols that necessitate interactive communication between the client and server(s) or non-collusion assumptions among multiple servers, Silenzio enables the fire-and-forget paradigm without such assumptions. In this approach, the client encrypts the training data once, and the cloud server performs the training without any further interaction.\nSilenzio operates over low bitwidth integers - never exceeding 8 bit - to mitigate the computational overhead of FHE. Our approach features a novel low-bitwidth matrix multiplication that leverages input-dependent residue number systems and a Karatsuba-inspired multiplication routine, ensuring that no intermediate FHE-processed value overflows 8 bit. Starting from an RNS-to-MRNS conversion process, we propose an efficient block-scaling mechanism, which approximately shifts encrypted tensor values to the user-specified most significant bits. To instantiate the backpropagation of the error, Silenzio introduces a low-bitwidth and TFHE friendly gradient computation for the cross entropy loss.\nImplemented using the state-of-the-art Concrete library, we evaluate Silenzio on standard MLP training tasks regarding runtime as well as model performance and achieve similar classification accuracy as MLPs trained using standard PyTorch with 32 bit floating-point computations. Our open-source implementation represents a significant advancement in privacy-preserving ML, providing a new baseline for secure and non-interactive outsourced MLP training.",

Stealthy False Data Injection Attacks (SFDIAs) are particularly concerning, as they manipulate sensor data to compromise system operations while avoiding detection. While existing studies have focused on either detection methods or specific attack formulations, the relationship between attack sophistication, system knowledge requirements, and achievable impact remains unexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis of sensor attacks against WDNs, investigating different combinations of physical constraints, state monitoring requirements, and intrusion detection evasion conditions. We propose several attack formulations that range from tailored strategies satisfying both physical and detection constraints to simpler measurement manipulations. The proposed attacks are simple and local -- requiring knowledge only of targeted sensors and their hydraulic connections -- making them scalable and practical. Through case studies on Net1 and Net3 benchmark networks, we demonstrate how these attacks can persistently increase operational costs and alter water flows while remaining undetected by monitoring systems for extended periods. The analysis provides utilities with insights for vulnerability assessment and motivates the development of protection strategies that combine physical and statistical security mechanisms.",

Although adversarial training has been an established technique for enhancing robustness in predictive models, it has been overlooked for generative models due to concerns about potential fidelity degradation by the nature of trade-offs between performance and robustness. In this work, we challenge this presumption, introducing Smooth Robust Latent VAE (SRL-VAE), a novel adversarial training framework that boosts both generation quality and robustness. In contrast to conventional adversarial training, which focuses on robustness only, our approach smooths the latent space via adversarial perturbations, promoting more generalizable representations while regularizing with originality representation to sustain original fidelity. Applied as a post-training step on pre-trained VAEs, SRL-VAE improves image robustness and fidelity with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show that SRL-VAE improves both generation quality, in image reconstruction and text-guided image editing, and robustness, against Nightshade attacks and image editing attacks. These results establish a new paradigm, showing that adversarial training, once thought to be detrimental to generative models, can instead enhance both fidelity and robustness.",

    "summary": "Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is the predominant privacy model for safeguarding individual data privacy. Existing perturbation mechanisms typically require perturbing the original values to ensure acceptable privacy, which inevitably results in value distortion and utility deterioration. In this work, we propose an alternative approach -- instead of perturbing values, we apply randomization to indexes of values while ensuring rigorous LDP guarantees. Inspired by the deniability of randomized indexes, we present CRIAD for answering subset counting queries on set-value data. By integrating a multi-dummy, multi-sample, and multi-group strategy, CRIAD serves as a fully scalable solution that offers flexibility across various privacy requirements and domain sizes, and achieves more accurate query results than any existing methods. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experimental evaluations, we validate the effectiveness of CRIAD and demonstrate its superiority over traditional value-perturbation mechanisms.",

    "summary": "Anomaly Detection (AD) defines the task of identifying observations or events that deviate from typical - or normal - patterns, a critical capability in IT security for recognizing incidents such as system misconfigurations, malware infections, or cyberattacks. In enterprise environments like SAP HANA Cloud systems, this task often involves monitoring high-dimensional, multivariate time series (MTS) derived from telemetry and log data. With the advent of quantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional latent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One approach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method with potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior applications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data, limiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we introduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards enterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the architecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with neural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters. We evaluate our model on datasets that closely reflect SAP system telemetry and show that the proposed QAE is a viable and efficient alternative for semisupervised AD in real-world enterprise settings.",

    "summary": "Aiming at the problems of poor quality of steganographic images and slow network convergence of image steganography models based on deep learning, this paper proposes a Steganography Curriculum Learning training strategy (STCL) for deep learning image steganography models. So that only easy images are selected for training when the model has poor fitting ability at the initial stage, and gradually expand to more difficult images, the strategy includes a difficulty evaluation strategy based on the teacher model and an knee point-based training scheduling strategy. Firstly, multiple teacher models are trained, and the consistency of the quality of steganographic images under multiple teacher models is used as the difficulty score to construct the training subsets from easy to difficult. Secondly, a training control strategy based on knee points is proposed to reduce the possibility of overfitting on small training sets and accelerate the training process. Experimental results on three large public datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, show that the proposed image steganography scheme is able to improve the model performance under multiple algorithmic frameworks, which not only has a high PSNR, SSIM score, and decoding accuracy, but also the steganographic images generated by the model under the training of the STCL strategy have a low steganography analysis scores.

    "summary": "A pseudorandom quantum state (PRS) is an ensemble of quantum states indistinguishable from Haar-random states to observers with efficient quantum computers. It allows one to substitute the costly Haar-random state with efficiently preparable PRS as a resource for cryptographic protocols, while also finding applications in quantum learning theory, black hole physics, many-body thermalization, quantum foundations, and quantum chaos. All existing constructions of PRS equate the notion of efficiency to quantum computers which runtime is bounded by a polynomial in its input size. In this work, we relax the notion of efficiency for PRS with respect to observers with near-term quantum computers implementing algorithms with runtime that scales slower than polynomial-time. We introduce the $\\mathbf{T}$-PRS which is indistinguishable to quantum algorithms with runtime $\\mathbf{T}(n)$ that grows slower than polynomials in the input size $n$. We give a set of reasonable conditions that a $\\mathbf{T}$-PRS must satisfy and give two constructions by using quantum-secure pseudorandom functions and pseudorandom functions. For $\\mathbf{T}(n)$ being linearithmic, linear, polylogarithmic, and logarithmic function, we characterize the amount of quantum resources a $\\mathbf{T}$-PRS must possess, particularly on its coherence, entanglement, and magic. Our quantum resource characterization applies generally to any two state ensembles that are indistinguishable to observers with computational power $\\mathbf{T}(n)$, giving a general necessary condition of whether a low-resource ensemble can mimic a high-resource ensemble, forming a $\\mathbf{T}$-pseudoresource pair. We demonstate how the necessary amount of resource decreases as the observer's computational power is more restricted, giving a $\\mathbf{T}$-pseudoresource pair with larger resource gap for more computationally limited observers.",

Our results show that genetic programming generally outperforms other evolutionary algorithms, although it falls short of the best-known results achieved by ad-hoc heuristics.

    "summary": "Despite the outstanding performance of Large language Models (LLMs) in diverse tasks, they are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, wherein adversarial prompts are crafted to bypass their security mechanisms and elicit unexpected responses. Although jailbreak attacks are prevalent, the understanding of their underlying mechanisms remains limited. Recent studies have explained typical jailbreaking behavior (e.g., the degree to which the model refuses to respond) of LLMs by analyzing representation shifts in their latent space caused by jailbreak prompts or identifying key neurons that contribute to the success of jailbreak attacks. However, these studies neither explore diverse jailbreak patterns nor provide a fine-grained explanation from the failure of circuit to the changes of representational, leaving significant gaps in uncovering the jailbreak mechanism. In this paper, we propose JailbreakLens, an interpretation framework that analyzes jailbreak mechanisms from both representation (which reveals how jailbreaks alter the model's harmfulness perception) and circuit perspectives~(which uncovers the causes of these deceptions by identifying key circuits contributing to the vulnerability), tracking their evolution throughout the entire response generation process. We then conduct an in-depth evaluation of jailbreak behavior on five mainstream LLMs under seven jailbreak strategies. Our evaluation reveals that jailbreak prompts amplify components that reinforce affirmative responses while suppressing those that produce refusal. This manipulation shifts model representations toward safe clusters to deceive the LLM, leading it to provide detailed responses instead of refusals. Notably, we find a strong and consistent correlation between representation deception and activation shift of key circuits across diverse jailbreak methods and multiple LLMs.",

This work presents a comprehensive methodology for conducting controlled fault injection attacks at the pre-silicon level and an analysis of the underlying system for root-causing behavior. As the driving application, we use the clock glitch attacks in AI/ML applications for critical misclassification. Our study aims to characterize and diagnose the impact of faults within the RISC-V instruction set and pipeline stages, while tracing fault propagation from the circuit level to the AI/ML application software. This analysis resulted in discovering two new vulnerabilities through controlled clock glitch parameters. First, we reveal a novel method for causing instruction skips, thereby preventing the loading of critical values from memory. This can cause disruption and affect program continuity and correctness. Second, we demonstrate an attack that converts legal instructions into illegal ones, thereby diverting control flow in a manner exploitable by attackers.

    "summary": "Recently, Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered recommender systems (RecSys) have brought significant advances in personalized user experience and have attracted considerable attention. Despite the impressive progress, the research question regarding the safety vulnerability of LLM-empowered RecSys still remains largely under-investigated. Given the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to focus on attacking the black-box RecSys, where attackers can only observe the system's inputs and outputs. However, traditional attack approaches employing reinforcement learning (RL) agents are not effective for attacking LLM-empowered RecSys due to the limited capabilities in processing complex textual inputs, planning, and reasoning. On the other hand, LLMs provide unprecedented opportunities to serve as attack agents to attack RecSys because of their impressive capability in simulating human-like decision-making processes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel attack framework called CheatAgent by harnessing the human-like capabilities of LLMs, where an LLM-based agent is developed to attack LLM-Empowered RecSys. Specifically, our method first identifies the insertion position for maximum impact with minimal input modification. After that, the LLM agent is designed to generate adversarial perturbations to insert at target positions. To further improve the quality of generated perturbations, we utilize the prompt tuning technique to improve attacking strategies via feedback from the victim RecSys iteratively. Extensive experiments across three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attacking method.",

Background: Multimodal models, particularly vision-language models, enhance artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities by integrating visual and textual data, mimicking human learning processes. Despite significant advancements, the trustworthiness of these models remains a crucial concern, particularly as AI systems increasingly confront issues regarding fairness, transparency, and ethics. Methods: This review examines research conducted from 2017 to 2024 focusing on forenamed core vision-language tasks. It employs a comparative approach to analyze these tasks through the lens of trustworthiness, underlining fairness, explainability, and ethics. This study synthesizes findings from recent literature to identify trends, challenges, and state-of-the-art solutions. Results: Several key findings were highlighted. Transparency: Explainability of vision language tasks is important for user trust. Techniques, such as attention maps and gradient-based methods, have successfully addressed this issue. Fairness: Bias mitigation in VQA and visual dialogue systems is essential for ensuring unbiased outcomes across diverse demographic groups. Ethical Implications: Addressing biases in multilingual models and ensuring ethical data handling is critical for the responsible deployment of vision-language systems.

However, widespread adoption remains hindered by issues such as limited scalability, high transaction costs, and the complexity of maintaining coherent verification logic across different blockchain layers. This paper introduces Verifiable Applications (vApps), a novel development framework designed to streamline the creation and deployment of verifiable blockchain computing applications. vApps offer a unified Rust-based Domain-Specific Language (DSL) within a comprehensive SDK, featuring modular abstractions for verification, proof generation, and inter-chain connectivity. This eases the developer's burden in securing diverse software components, allowing them to focus on application logic. The DSL also ensures that applications can automatically take advantage of specialized precompiles and hardware acceleration to achieve consistently high performance with minimal developer effort, as demonstrated by benchmark results for zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). Experiments show that native Rust execution eliminates interpretation overhead, delivering up to an 832x cycle count improvement compared to EVM-based approaches. Precompiled circuits can accelerate the proof by more than 95%, while GPU acceleration increases throughput by up to 30x and recursion compresses the proof size by up to 230x, enabling succinct and efficient verification. The framework also supports seamless integration with the Web2 and Web3 systems, enabling developers to focus solely on their application logic. Through modular architecture, robust security guarantees, and composability, vApps pave the way toward a trust-minimized and verifiable Internet-scale application environment.",

In this paper, we design and implement, MoCQ, a novel holistic neuro-symbolic framework that combines the complementary strengths of LLMs and classical static analysis to enable scalable vulnerability detection. The key insight is that MoCQ leverages an LLM to automatically extract vulnerability patterns and translate them into detection queries, and then on static analysis to refine such queries in a feedback loop and eventually execute them for analyzing large codebases and mining vulnerabilities. We evaluate MoCQ on seven types of vulnerabilities spanning two programming languages. We found MoCQ-generated queries uncovered at least 12 patterns that were missed by experts. On a ground truth dataset, MoCQ achieved comparable precision and recall compared to expert-crafted queries. Moreover, MoCQ has identified seven previously unknown vulnerabilities in real-world applications, demonstrating its practical effectiveness. We have responsibly disclosed them to the corresponding developers.",

Python-processed data was structured into training/test sets. Using the CART algorithm with Gini coefficient evaluation, we built initial decision trees for feature extraction. A random forest model was implemented to improve robustness through random data/feature sampling and multitree integration. GridSearch hyperparameter tuning further optimized the model, with 3D visualizations demonstrating parameter impacts on vulnerability detection.\nResults show the random forest model excels in detecting all five vulnerabilities. For example, it identifies Risky Mutable Proxy by analyzing authorization mechanisms and state modifications, while ERC-721 Reentrancy detection relies on external call locations and lock mechanisms. The ensemble approach effectively reduces single-tree overfitting, with stable performance improvements after parameter tuning. This method provides an efficient technical solution for automated NFT contract detection and lays groundwork for scaling AI applications.",

    "summary": "Popular blockchains today have hundreds of thousands of nodes and need to be able to support sophisticated scaling solutions$\\unicode{x2013}$such as sharding, data availability sampling, and layer-2 methods. Designing secure and efficient peer-to-peer (p2p) networking protocols at these scales to support the tight demands of the upper layer crypto-economic primitives is a highly non-trivial endeavor. We identify decentralized, uniform random sampling of nodes as a fundamental capability necessary for building robust p2p networks in emerging blockchain networks. Sampling algorithms used in practice today (primarily for address discovery) rely on either distributed hash tables (e.g., Kademlia) or sharing addresses with neighbors (e.g., GossipSub), and are not secure in a Sybil setting. We present Honeybee, a decentralized algorithm for sampling nodes that uses verifiable random walks and table consistency checks. Honeybee is secure against attacks even in the presence of an overwhelming number of Byzantine nodes (e.g., $\\geq50\\%$ of the network). We evaluate Honeybee through experiments and show that the quality of sampling achieved by Honeybee is significantly better compared to the state-of-the-art. Our proposed algorithm has implications for network design in both full nodes and light nodes.",

    "summary": "Blockchains implement decentralized monetary systems and applications. Recent advancements enable what we call tethering a blockchain to a primary blockchain, securing the tethered chain by nodes that post primary-chain tokens as collateral. The collateral ensures nodes behave as intended, until they withdraw it. Unlike a Proof of Stake blockchain which uses its own token as collateral, using primary-chain tokens shields the tethered chain from the volatility of its own token.\nState-of-the-art tethered blockchains either rely on centralization, or make extreme assumptions: that all communication is synchronous, that operators remain correct even post-withdrawal, or that withdrawals can be indefinitely delayed by tethered-chain failures.\nWe prove that with partial synchrony, there is no solution to the problem. However, under the standard assumptions that communication with the primary chain is synchronous and communication among the tethered chain nodes is partially synchronous, there is a solution. We present a tethered-chain protocol called Aegis. Aegis uses references from its blocks to primary blocks to define committees, checkpoints on the primary chain to perpetuate decisions, and resets to establish new committees when previous ones become obsolete. It ensures safety at all times and rapid progress when latency among Aegis nodes is low.",

We present GRAGPoison, a novel attack that exploits shared relations in the underlying knowledge graph to craft poisoning text capable of compromising multiple queries simultaneously. GRAGPoison employs three key strategies: i) relation injection to introduce false knowledge, ii) relation enhancement to amplify poisoning influence, and iii) narrative generation to embed malicious content within coherent text. Empirical evaluation across diverse datasets and models shows that GRAGPoison substantially outperforms existing attacks in terms of effectiveness (up to 98\\% success rate) and scalability (using less than 68\\% poisoning text) on various GraphRAG-based systems.

This review consolidates extensive research efforts providing a comprehensive overview of the multifaceted aspects of demographic fairness in FR.\nWe systematically examine the primary causes, datasets, assessment metrics, and mitigation approaches associated with demographic disparities in FR. By categorizing key contributions in these areas, this work provides a structured approach to understanding and addressing the complexity of this issue.

For instance, they can reveal sensitive information that can be inferred from location data. This location data is shared through service providers as well as mobile applications. Understanding how and with whom users share their location data -- as well as users' perception of the underlying privacy risks --, are important notions to grasp in order to design usable privacy-enhancing technologies. In this work, we perform a quantitative and qualitative analysis of smartphone users' awareness, perception and self-reported behavior towards location data-sharing through a survey of n=99 young adult participants (i.e., digital natives). We compare stated practices with actual behaviors to better understand their mental models, and survey participants' understanding of privacy risks before and after the inspection of location traces and the information that can be inferred therefrom.\nOur empirical results show that participants have risky privacy practices: about 54% of participants underestimate the number of mobile applications to which they have granted access to their data, and 33% forget or do not think of revoking access to their data. Also, by using a demonstrator to perform inferences from location data, we observe that slightly more than half of participants (57%) are surprised by the extent of potentially inferred information, and that 47% intend to reduce access to their data via permissions as a result of using the demonstrator. Last, a majority of participants have little knowledge of the tools to better protect themselves, but are nonetheless willing to follow suggestions to improve privacy (51%). Educating people, including digital natives, about privacy risks through transparency tools seems a promising approach.",

Existing approaches often formulate code editing as an implicit end-to-end task, omitting the fact that code-editing procedures inherently consist of discrete and explicit steps. Thus, they suffer from suboptimal performance and lack of robustness and generalization. We introduce EditLord, a code editing framework that makes the code transformation steps explicit. Our key insight is to employ a language model (LM) as an inductive learner to extract code editing rules from the training code pairs as concise meta-rule sets. Such rule sets will be manifested for each training sample to augment them for finetuning or assist in prompting- and iterative-based code editing. EditLordoutperforms the state-of-the-art by an average of 22.7% in editing performance and 58.1% in robustness while achieving 20.2% higher functional correctness across critical software engineering and security applications, LM models, and editing modes.",

Real-world software vulnerability datasets are rare and hard to acquire, as there is no simple metric for classifying vulnerability. Such datasets are heavily imbalanced, and none of the current datasets are considered huge for DL models. To tackle these problems, a recent work has tried to augment the dataset using the source code and generate realistic single-statement vulnerabilities, which is not quite practical and requires manual checking of the generated vulnerabilities. In this paper, we aim to explore the augmentation of vulnerabilities at the representation level to help current models learn better, which has never been done before to the best of our knowledge. We implement and evaluate five augmentation techniques that augment the embedding of the data and have recently been used for code search, which is a completely different software engineering task. We also introduced a conditioned version of those augmentation methods, which ensures the augmentation does not change the vulnerable section of the vector representation. We show that such augmentation methods can be helpful and increase the F1-score by up to 9.67%, yet they cannot beat Random Oversampling when balancing datasets, which increases the F1-score by 10.82%.",

    "summary": "This paper addresses the critical environmental challenge of estimating ambient Nitrogen Dioxide (NO$_2$) concentrations, a key issue in public health and environmental policy. Existing methods for satellite-based air pollution estimation model the relationship between satellite and in-situ measurements at select point locations. While these approaches have advanced our ability to provide air quality estimations on a global scale, they come with inherent limitations. The most notable limitation is the computational intensity required for generating comprehensive estimates over extensive areas. Motivated by these limitations, this study introduces a novel dense estimation technique. Our approach seeks to balance the accuracy of high-resolution estimates with the practicality of computational constraints, thereby enabling efficient and scalable global environmental assessment. By utilizing a uniformly random offset sampling strategy, our method disperses the ground truth data pixel location evenly across a larger patch. At inference, the dense estimation method can then generate a grid of estimates in a single step, significantly reducing the computational resources required to provide estimates for larger areas. Notably, our approach also surpasses the results of existing point-wise methods by a significant margin of $9.45\\%$, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of $4.98\\ \\mu\\text{g}/\\text{m}^3$. This demonstrates both high accuracy and computational efficiency, highlighting the applicability of our method for global environmental assessment. Furthermore, we showcase the method's adaptability and robustness by applying it to diverse geographic regions. Our method offers a viable solution to the computational challenges of large-scale environmental monitoring.",

Our approach comprises two key components. First, Dynamic Token Merging (DToMe) reduces the number of visual token embeddings by merging similar tokens based on image complexity, addressing the inherent inefficiency of fixed-length outputs in vision transformers. Second, Virtual Token Unmerging (VTU) simulates the expected token sequence for large language models (LLMs) by efficiently reconstructing the attention dynamics of a full sequence, thus preserving the downstream performance without additional fine-tuning. Unlike previous approaches, our method dynamically adapts token compression to the content of the image and operates completely training-free, making it readily applicable to most state-of-the-art VLM architectures. Extensive experiments on image and video understanding tasks demonstrate that DyMU can reduce the average visual token count by 32%-85% while achieving comparable performance to full-length models across diverse VLM architectures, including the recently popularized AnyRes-based visual encoders. Furthermore, through qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that DToMe effectively adapts token reduction based on image complexity and, unlike existing systems, provides users more control over computational costs.

    "summary": "Autoregressive patch-based image generation has recently shown competitive results in terms of image quality and scalability. It can also be easily integrated and scaled within Vision-Language models. Nevertheless, autoregressive models require a defined order for patch generation. While a natural order based on the dictation of the words makes sense for text generation, there is no inherent generation order that exists for image generation. Traditionally, a raster-scan order (from top-left to bottom-right) guides autoregressive image generation models. In this paper, we argue that this order is suboptimal, as it fails to respect the causality of the image content: for instance, when conditioned on a visual description of a sunset, an autoregressive model may generate clouds before the sun, even though the color of clouds should depend on the color of the sun and not the inverse. In this work, we show that first by training a model to generate patches in any-given-order, we can infer both the content and the location (order) of each patch during generation. Secondly, we use these extracted orders to finetune the any-given-order model to produce better-quality images. Through our experiments, we show on two datasets that this new generation method produces better images than the traditional raster-scan approach, with similar training costs and no extra annotations.",

In the context of automotive object detection, methods usually focus on producing augmented frames that look as realistic as possible, for example by replacing real objects with generated ones. Others try to maximize the diversity of augmented frames, for example by pasting lots of generated objects onto existing backgrounds. Both perspectives pay little attention to the locations of objects in the scene. Frame layouts are either reused with little or no modification, or they are random and disregard realism entirely. In this work, we argue that optimal data augmentation should also include realistic augmentation of layouts. We introduce a scene-aware probabilistic location model that predicts where new objects can realistically be placed in an existing scene. By then inpainting objects in these locations with a generative model, we obtain much stronger augmentation performance than existing approaches. We set a new state of the art for generative data augmentation on two automotive object detection tasks, achieving up to $2.8\\times$ higher gains than the best competing approach ($+1.4$ vs. $+0.5$ mAP boost).

For instance, lncRNAs are predominantly associated with chromatin and act as regulators of gene transcription and chromatin structure, while mRNAs are distributed across the nucleus and cytoplasm, facilitating the transport of genetic information for protein synthesis. Understanding RNA localization sheds light on processes like gene expression regulation with spatial and temporal precision. However, traditional wet lab methods for determining RNA localization, such as in situ hybridization, are often time-consuming, resource-demanding, and costly. To overcome these challenges, computational methods leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as powerful alternatives, enabling large-scale prediction of RNA subcellular localization. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in AI-based approaches for RNA subcellular localization prediction, covering various RNA types and focusing on sequence-based, image-based, and hybrid methodologies that combine both data types. We highlight the potential of these methods to accelerate RNA research, uncover molecular pathways, and guide targeted disease treatments. Furthermore, we critically discuss the challenges in AI/ML approaches for RNA subcellular localization, such as data scarcity and lack of benchmarks, and opportunities to address them. This review aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to develop innovative solutions in the field of RNA subcellular localization and beyond.",

    "summary": "Electroencephalography (EEG) signals provide a promising and involuntary reflection of brain activity related to emotional states, offering significant advantages over behavioral cues like facial expressions. However, EEG signals are often noisy, affected by artifacts, and vary across individuals, complicating emotion recognition. While multimodal approaches have used Peripheral Physiological Signals (PPS) like GSR to complement EEG, they often overlook the dynamic synchronization and consistent semantics between the modalities. Additionally, the temporal dynamics of emotional fluctuations across different time resolutions in PPS remain underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose PhysioSync, a novel pre-training framework leveraging temporal and cross-modal contrastive learning, inspired by physiological synchronization phenomena. PhysioSync incorporates Cross-Modal Consistency Alignment (CM-CA) to model dynamic relationships between EEG and complementary PPS, enabling emotion-related synchronizations across modalities. Besides, it introduces Long- and Short-Term Temporal Contrastive Learning (LS-TCL) to capture emotional synchronization at different temporal resolutions within modalities. After pre-training, cross-resolution and cross-modal features are hierarchically fused and fine-tuned to enhance emotion recognition. Experiments on DEAP and DREAMER datasets demonstrate PhysioSync's advanced performance under uni-modal and cross-modal conditions, highlighting its effectiveness for EEG-centered emotion recognition.",

This paper examines these approaches along with their roots in the computer vision field in order to characterize potential advantages and pitfalls while outlining future directions to further improve remote sensing-specific foundation models. We discuss the quality of the learned representations and methods to alleviate the need for massive compute resources. We place emphasis on the multi-sensor aspect of Earth observations, and the extent to which existing approaches leverage multiple sensors in training foundation models in relation to multi-modal foundation models. Finally, we identify opportunities for further harnessing the vast amounts of unlabeled, seasonal, and multi-sensor remote sensing observations.",

Additionally, the high computational costs associated with training or fine-tuning make direct improvements impractical. To overcome these limitations, we introduce \\(\\projectname\\), a novel zero-training video refinement pipeline that leverages neuro-symbolic feedback to automatically enhance video generation, achieving superior alignment with the prompts.

Perspective-taking, the ability to perceive an environment or situation from an alternative viewpoint, is a key benchmark for human-level visual understanding, essential for environmental interaction and collaboration with autonomous agents. Despite advancements in spatial reasoning within VLMs, recent research has shown that modern VLMs significantly lack perspective-aware reasoning capabilities and exhibit a strong bias toward egocentric interpretations. To bridge the gap between VLMs and human perception, we focus on the role of mental imagery, where humans perceive the world through abstracted representations that facilitate perspective shifts. Motivated by this, we propose a framework for perspective-aware reasoning, named Abstract Perspective Change (APC), that effectively leverages vision foundation models, such as object detection, segmentation, and orientation estimation, to construct scene abstractions and enable perspective transformations. Our experiments on synthetic and real-image benchmarks, compared with various VLMs, demonstrate significant improvements in perspective-aware reasoning with our framework, further outperforming fine-tuned spatial reasoning models and novel-view-synthesis-based approaches.",

    "summary": "Even in the era of rapid advances in large models, video understanding, particularly long videos, remains highly challenging. Compared with textual or image-based information, videos commonly contain more information with redundancy, requiring large models to strategically allocate attention at a global level for accurate comprehension. To address this, we propose MCAF, an agent-based, training-free framework perform video understanding through Multimodal Coarse-to-fine Attention Focusing. The key innovation lies in its ability to sense and prioritize segments of the video that are highly relevant to the understanding task. First, MCAF hierarchically concentrates on highly relevant frames through multimodal information, enhancing the correlation between the acquired contextual information and the query. Second, it employs a dilated temporal expansion mechanism to mitigate the risk of missing crucial details when extracting information from these concentrated frames. In addition, our framework incorporates a self-reflection mechanism utilizing the confidence level of the model's responses as feedback. By iteratively applying these two creative focusing strategies, it adaptively adjusts attention to capture highly query-connected context and thus improves response accuracy. MCAF outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on average. On the EgoSchema dataset, it achieves a remarkable 5% performance gain over the leading approach. Meanwhile, on Next-QA and IntentQA datasets, it outperforms the current state-of-the-art standard by 0.2% and 0.3% respectively. On the Video-MME dataset, which features videos averaging nearly an hour in length, MCAF also outperforms other agent-based methods.",

To address this limitation, we propose a novel detection framework that integrates multi-scale spatial-frequency analysis for universal deepfake detection. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a local spectral feature extraction pipeline that combines block-wise discrete cosine transform with cascaded multi-scale convolutions to capture subtle spectral artifacts; (2) a global spectral feature extraction pipeline utilizing scale-invariant differential accumulation to identify holistic forgery distribution patterns; and (3) a multi-stage cross-modal fusion mechanism that incorporates shallow-layer attention enhancement and deep-layer dynamic modulation to model spatial-frequency interactions.

To address this gap, we propose Set-of-Vision-Text Prompting (SoVTP), a novel framework that enhances zero-shot emotion recognition by integrating spatial annotations (e.g., bounding boxes, facial landmarks), physiological signals (facial action units), and contextual cues (body posture, scene dynamics, others' emotions) into a unified prompting strategy. SoVTP preserves holistic scene information while enabling fine-grained analysis of facial muscle movements and interpersonal dynamics. Extensive experiments show that SoVTP achieves substantial improvements over existing visual prompting methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing VLLMs' video emotion recognition capabilities.",

Although conventional image compression techniques can be adapted to improve compression efficiency for RIs, their practical performance is expected to be limited due to differences in bit precision and the distinct pixel value distribution characteristics between natural images and RIs. We propose a novel implicit neural representation~(INR)--based RI compression method that effectively handles floating-point valued pixels. The proposed method divides RIs into depth and mask images and compresses them using patch-wise and pixel-wise INR architectures with model pruning and quantization, respectively.

    "summary": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and widespread use of smartphones have resulted in an exponential growth of image data, both real (camera-captured) and virtual (AI-generated). This surge underscores the critical need for robust image quality assessment (IQA) methods that accurately reflect human visual perception. Traditional IQA techniques primarily rely on spatial features - such as signal-to-noise ratio, local structural distortions, and texture inconsistencies - to identify artifacts. While effective for unprocessed or conventionally altered images, these methods fall short in the context of modern image post-processing powered by deep neural networks (DNNs). The rise of DNN-based models for image generation, enhancement, and restoration has significantly improved visual quality, yet made accurate assessment increasingly complex. To address this, we propose a novel IQA approach that bridges the gap between deep learning methods and human perception. Our model disentangles deep features into high-level semantic information and low-level perceptual details, treating each stream separately. These features are then combined with conventional IQA metrics to provide a more comprehensive evaluation framework. This hybrid design enables the model to assess both global context and intricate image details, better reflecting the human visual process, which first interprets overall structure before attending to fine-grained elements. The final stage employs a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to map the integrated features into a concise quality score. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves improved consistency with human perceptual judgments compared to existing IQA models.",

The paradigm of QAT is to introduce fake quantization operators during the training process, allowing the model to autonomously compensate for information loss caused by quantization. Making quantization parameters trainable can significantly improve the performance of QAT, but at the cost of compromising the flexibility during inference, especially when dealing with activation values with substantially different distributions. In this paper, we propose an effective learnable adaptive neural network quantization method, called Adaptive Step Size Quantization (ASQ), to resolve this conflict. Specifically, the proposed ASQ method first dynamically adjusts quantization scaling factors through a trained module capable of accommodating different activations. Then, to address the rigid resolution issue inherent in Power of Two (POT) quantization, we propose an efficient non-uniform quantization scheme. We utilize the Power Of Square root of Two (POST) as the basis for exponential quantization, effectively handling the bell-shaped distribution of neural network weights across various bit-widths while maintaining computational efficiency through a Look-Up Table method (LUT). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ASQ method is superior to the state-of-the-art QAT approaches.

Nevertheless, existing methods either typically require time-consuming fine-tuning (inefficient), fail to accomplish multiple semantic manipulations (poorly extensible), and/or lack support for different modality tasks (limited generalizability).

While deep learning approaches have significantly improved performance, they often incur substantial computational costs, limiting their deployment in real-time edge applications. Efforts to create lightweight neural networks have seen some success, yet they often result in trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, the high-dimensional descriptors generated by these networks poses challenges for distributed applications requiring efficient communication and coordination, highlighting the need for compact yet competitively accurate descriptors. In this paper, we present EdgePoint2, a series of lightweight keypoint detection and description neural networks specifically tailored for edge computing applications on embedded system. The network architecture is optimized for efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To train compact descriptors, we introduce a combination of Orthogonal Procrustes loss and similarity loss, which can serve as a general approach for hypersphere embedding distillation tasks. Additionally, we offer 14 sub-models to satisfy diverse application requirements. Our experiments demonstrate that EdgePoint2 consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy and efficiency across various challenging scenarios while employing lower-dimensional descriptors (32/48/64). Beyond its accuracy, EdgePoint2 offers significant advantages in flexibility, robustness, and versatility.

    "summary": "The rapid growth of online video platforms, particularly live streaming services, has created an urgent need for real-time video understanding systems. These systems must process continuous video streams and respond to user queries instantaneously, presenting unique challenges for current Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs). While existing VideoLLMs excel at processing complete videos, they face significant limitations in streaming scenarios due to their inability to handle dense, redundant frames efficiently. We introduce TimeChat-Online, a novel online VideoLLM that revolutionizes real-time video interaction. At its core lies our innovative Differential Token Drop (DTD) module, which addresses the fundamental challenge of visual redundancy in streaming videos. Drawing inspiration from human visual perception's Change Blindness phenomenon, DTD preserves meaningful temporal changes while filtering out static, redundant content between frames. Remarkably, our experiments demonstrate that DTD achieves an 82.8% reduction in video tokens while maintaining 98% performance on StreamingBench, revealing that over 80% of visual content in streaming videos is naturally redundant without requiring language guidance. To enable seamless real-time interaction, we present TimeChat-Online-139K, a comprehensive streaming video dataset featuring diverse interaction patterns including backward-tracing, current-perception, and future-responding scenarios. TimeChat-Online's unique Proactive Response capability, naturally achieved through continuous monitoring of video scene transitions via DTD, sets it apart from conventional approaches. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates TimeChat-Online's superior performance on streaming benchmarks (StreamingBench and OvOBench) and maintaining competitive results on long-form video tasks such as Video-MME and MLVU.",

    "summary": "Personalized image generation has emerged as a promising direction in multimodal content creation. It aims to synthesize images tailored to individual style preferences (e.g., color schemes, character appearances, layout) and semantic intentions (e.g., emotion, action, scene contexts) by leveraging user-interacted history images and multimodal instructions. Despite notable progress, existing methods -- whether based on diffusion models, large language models, or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) -- struggle to accurately capture and fuse user style preferences and semantic intentions. In particular, the state-of-the-art LMM-based method suffers from the entanglement of visual features, leading to Guidance Collapse, where the generated images fail to preserve user-preferred styles or reflect the specified semantics.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce DRC, a novel personalized image generation framework that enhances LMMs through Disentangled Representation Composition. DRC explicitly extracts user style preferences and semantic intentions from history images and the reference image, respectively, to form user-specific latent instructions that guide image generation within LMMs. Specifically, it involves two critical learning stages: 1) Disentanglement learning, which employs a dual-tower disentangler to explicitly separate style and semantic features, optimized via a reconstruction-driven paradigm with difficulty-aware importance sampling; and 2) Personalized modeling, which applies semantic-preserving augmentations to effectively adapt the disentangled representations for robust personalized generation. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that DRC shows competitive performance while effectively mitigating the guidance collapse issue, underscoring the importance of disentangled representation learning for controllable and effective personalized image generation.",

To address these challenges, we propose Iterative Implicit Neural Representations (I-INRs) a novel plug-and-play framework that enhances signal reconstruction through an iterative refinement process.

Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising capabilities in temporal grounding and video understanding, soccer commentary generation often requires precise temporal localization and semantically rich descriptions over long-form video. However, existing soccer MLLMs often rely on the temporal a priori for caption generation, so they cannot process the soccer video end-to-end. While some traditional approaches follow a two-step paradigm that is complex and fails to capture the global context to achieve suboptimal performance. To solve the above issues, we present TimeSoccer, the first end-to-end soccer MLLM for Single-anchor Dense Video Captioning (SDVC) in full-match soccer videos. TimeSoccer jointly predicts timestamps and generates captions in a single pass, enabling global context modeling across 45-minute matches. To support long video understanding of soccer matches, we introduce MoFA-Select, a training-free, motion-aware frame compression module that adaptively selects representative frames via a coarse-to-fine strategy, and incorporates complementary training paradigms to strengthen the model's ability to handle long temporal sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TimeSoccer achieves State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on the SDVC task in an end-to-end form, generating high-quality commentary with accurate temporal alignment and strong semantic relevance.",

In this paper, we introduce the DeepScenario Open 3D Dataset (DSC3D), a high-quality, occlusion-free dataset of 6 degrees of freedom bounding box trajectories acquired through a novel monocular camera drone tracking pipeline. Our dataset includes more than 175,000 trajectories of 14 types of traffic participants and significantly exceeds existing datasets in terms of diversity and scale, containing many unprecedented scenarios such as complex vehicle-pedestrian interaction on highly populated urban streets and comprehensive parking maneuvers from entry to exit. DSC3D dataset was captured in five various locations in Europe and the United States and include: a parking lot, a crowded inner-city, a steep urban intersection, a federal highway, and a suburban intersection. Our 3D trajectory dataset aims to enhance autonomous driving systems by providing detailed environmental 3D representations, which could lead to improved obstacle interactions and safety. We demonstrate its utility across multiple applications including motion prediction, motion planning, scenario mining, and generative reactive traffic agents.

In this work, we propose a plug-and-play Semantic-Driven Visual Prompt Tuning framework (SDVPT) that transfers knowledge from the training set to unseen categories with minimal overhead in parameters and inference time. First, we introduce a two-stage visual prompt learning strategy composed of Category-Specific Prompt Initialization (CSPI) and Topology-Guided Prompt Refinement (TGPR). The CSPI generates category-specific visual prompts, and then TGPR distills latent structural patterns from the VLM's text encoder to refine these prompts. During inference, we dynamically synthesize the visual prompts for unseen categories based on the semantic correlation between unseen and training categories, facilitating robust text-image alignment for unseen categories. Extensive experiments integrating SDVPT with all available open-world object counting models demonstrate its effectiveness and adaptability across three widely used datasets: FSC-147, CARPK, and PUCPR+.",

In this context, foundation models facilitate remote sensing image analysis to retrieve relevant geoinformation accurately and efficiently. However, as these models grow in size, fine-tuning becomes increasingly challenging due to the associated computational resources and costs, limiting their accessibility and scalability. Furthermore, full fine-tuning can lead to forgetting pre-trained features and even degrade model generalization. To address this, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques offer a promising solution. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments with various foundation model architectures and PEFT techniques to evaluate their effectiveness on five different EO datasets. Our results provide a comprehensive comparison, offering insights into when and how PEFT methods support the adaptation of pre-trained geospatial models. We demonstrate that PEFT techniques match or even exceed full fine-tuning performance and enhance model generalisation to unseen geographic regions, while reducing training time and memory requirements. Additional experiments investigate the effect of architecture choices such as the decoder type or the use of metadata, suggesting UNet decoders and fine-tuning without metadata as the recommended configuration. We have integrated all evaluated foundation models and techniques into the open-source package TerraTorch to support quick, scalable, and cost-effective model adaptation.",

Our approach is based on a novel Feature Extraction Mamba (FE-Mamba) module, which enhances long-range spatial dependencies both within and across stereo images. To effectively integrate multi-scale features from FE-Mamba, we then introduce a novel Multidimensional Feature Fusion (MFF) module.

This approach not only improves discriminative power but also enhances instruction-following ability in downstream tasks.

The more we observe the object motion, the better we get at predicting its 3D state immediately. Existing systems either optimize underlying representations from multi-view observations or train a feed-forward predictor from supervised datasets. We introduce Predict-Optimize-Distill (POD), a self-improving framework that interleaves prediction and optimization in a mutually reinforcing cycle to achieve better 4D object understanding with increasing observation time. Given a multi-view object scan and a long-form monocular video of human-object interaction, POD iteratively trains a neural network to predict local part poses from RGB frames, uses this predictor to initialize a global optimization which refines output poses through inverse rendering, then finally distills the results of optimization back into the model by generating synthetic self-labeled training data from novel viewpoints. Each iteration improves both the predictive model and the optimized motion trajectory, creating a virtuous cycle that bootstraps its own training data to learn about the pose configurations of an object. We also introduce a quasi-multiview mining strategy for reducing depth ambiguity by leveraging long video. We evaluate POD on 14 real-world and 5 synthetic objects with various joint types, including revolute and prismatic joints as well as multi-body configurations where parts detach or reattach independently. POD demonstrates significant improvement over a pure optimization baseline which gets stuck in local minima, particularly for longer videos. We also find that POD's performance improves with both video length and successive iterations of the self-improving cycle, highlighting its ability to scale performance with additional observations and looped refinement.",

    "summary": "There has been impressive progress in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). Recent works extend these models to long inputs, including multi-page documents and long videos. However, the model size and performance of these long context models are still limited due to the computational cost in both training and inference. In this work, we explore an orthogonal direction and process long inputs without long context LMMs. We propose Frame Selection Augmented Generation (FRAG), where the model first selects relevant frames within the input, and then only generates the final outputs based on the selected frames. The core of the selection process is done by scoring each frame independently, which does not require long context processing. The frames with the highest scores are then selected by a simple Top-K selection. We show that this frustratingly simple framework is applicable to both long videos and multi-page documents using existing LMMs without any fine-tuning. We consider two models, LLaVA-OneVision and InternVL2, in our experiments and show that FRAG consistently improves the performance and achieves state-of-the-art performances for both long video and long document understanding. For videos, FRAG substantially improves InternVL2-76B by 5.8% on MLVU and 3.7% on Video-MME. For documents, FRAG achieves over 20% improvements on MP-DocVQA compared with recent LMMs specialized in long document understanding. Code is available at: this https URL",

    "summary": "Expressive human pose and shape estimation (EHPS) is crucial for digital human generation, especially in applications like live streaming. While existing research primarily focuses on reducing estimation errors, it largely neglects robustness and security aspects, leaving these systems vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To address this significant challenge, we propose the \\textbf{Tangible Attack (TBA)}, a novel framework designed to generate adversarial examples capable of effectively compromising any digital human generation model. Our approach introduces a \\textbf{Dual Heterogeneous Noise Generator (DHNG)}, which leverages Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and ControlNet to produce diverse, targeted noise tailored to the original image features. Additionally, we design a custom \\textbf{adversarial loss function} to optimize the noise, ensuring both high controllability and potent disruption. By iteratively refining the adversarial sample through multi-gradient signals from both the noise and the state-of-the-art EHPS model, TBA substantially improves the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate TBA's superiority, achieving a remarkable 41.0\\% increase in estimation error, with an average improvement of approximately 17.0\\%. These findings expose significant security vulnerabilities in current EHPS models and highlight the need for stronger defenses in digital human generation systems.",

    "summary": "We propose a novel sample selection method for image classification in the presence of noisy labels. Existing methods typically consider small-loss samples as correctly labeled. However, some correctly labeled samples are inherently difficult for the model to learn and can exhibit high loss similar to mislabeled samples in the early stages of training. Consequently, setting a threshold on per-sample loss to select correct labels results in a trade-off between precision and recall in sample selection: a lower threshold may miss many correctly labeled hard-to-learn samples (low recall), while a higher threshold may include many mislabeled samples (low precision). To address this issue, our goal is to accurately distinguish correctly labeled yet hard-to-learn samples from mislabeled ones, thus alleviating the trade-off dilemma. We achieve this by considering the trends in model prediction confidence rather than relying solely on loss values. Empirical observations show that only for correctly labeled samples, the model's prediction confidence for the annotated labels typically increases faster than for any other classes. Based on this insight, we propose tracking the confidence gaps between the annotated labels and other classes during training and evaluating their trends using the Mann-Kendall Test. A sample is considered potentially correctly labeled if all its confidence gaps tend to increase. Our method functions as a plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing sample selection techniques. Experiments on several standard benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of existing methods for learning with noisy labels.",

Existing methods either assess only one aspect of the task (i.e., textual alignment or subject preservation), misalign with human judgments, or rely on costly API-based evaluation. To address this, we introduce RefVNLI, a cost-effective metric that evaluates both textual alignment and subject preservation in a single prediction. Trained on a large-scale dataset derived from video-reasoning benchmarks and image perturbations, RefVNLI outperforms or matches existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and subject categories (e.g., \\emph{Animal}, \\emph{Object}), achieving up to 6.4-point gains in textual alignment and 8.5-point gains in subject consistency.

    "summary": "To segment medical images with distribution shifts, domain generalization (DG) has emerged as a promising setting to train models on source domains that can generalize to unseen target domains. Existing DG methods are mainly based on CNN or ViT architectures. Recently, advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown promising results in various supervised medical image segmentation. The success of Mamba is primarily owing to its ability to capture long-range dependencies while keeping linear complexity with input sequence length, making it a promising alternative to CNNs and ViTs. Inspired by the success, in the paper, we explore the potential of the Mamba architecture to address distribution shifts in DG for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we propose a novel Mamba-based framework, Mamba-Sea, incorporating global-to-local sequence augmentation to improve the model's generalizability under domain shift issues. Our Mamba-Sea introduces a global augmentation mechanism designed to simulate potential variations in appearance across different sites, aiming to suppress the model's learning of domain-specific information. At the local level, we propose a sequence-wise augmentation along input sequences, which perturbs the style of tokens within random continuous sub-sequences by modeling and resampling style statistics associated with domain shifts. To our best knowledge, Mamba-Sea is the first work to explore the generalization of Mamba for medical image segmentation, providing an advanced and promising Mamba-based architecture with strong robustness to domain shifts. Remarkably, our proposed method is the first to surpass a Dice coefficient of 90% on the Prostate dataset, which exceeds previous SOTA of 88.61%. The code is available at this https URL.",

Recent methods address this problem through a two-stage process or optimized one-stage approaches. However, these methods either require multiple networks to be serially trained and perform more time-consuming sequential decoding, or rely on complex post-processing algorithms to parse the logical structure of tables. They struggle to balance cross-scenario adaptability, robustness, and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a one-stage end-to-end table structure parsing network called TableCenterNet. This network unifies the prediction of table spatial and logical structure into a parallel regression task for the first time, and implicitly learns the spatial-logical location mapping laws of cells through a synergistic architecture of shared feature extraction layers and task-specific decoding. Compared with two-stage methods, our method is easier to train and faster to infer. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that TableCenterNet can effectively parse table structures in diverse scenarios and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the TableGraph-24k dataset.

Traditional methods primarily utilize information from adjacent pixels for reconstructing missing areas, while they struggle to preserve complex details and structures. Simultaneously, models based on deep learning necessitate substantial amounts of training data. To address this challenge, an encoding strategy-inspired diffusion model with few-shot learning for color image inpainting is proposed in this paper. The main idea of this novel encoding strategy is the deployment of a \"virtual mask\" to construct high-dimensional objects through mutual perturbations between channels. This approach enables the diffusion model to capture diverse image representations and detailed features from limited training samples. Moreover, the encoding strategy leverages redundancy between channels, integrates with low-rank methods during iterative inpainting, and incorporates the diffusion model to achieve accurate information output. Experimental results indicate that our method exceeds current techniques in quantitative metrics, and the reconstructed images quality has been improved in aspects of texture and structural integrity, leading to more precise and coherent results.",

Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective disease management and control. In response, this study proposes a novel deep learning-based framework for the automated detection of monkeypox from skin lesion images, leveraging the power of transfer learning, dimensionality reduction, and advanced machine learning techniques. We utilize the newly developed Monkeypox Skin Lesion Dataset (MSLD), which includes images of monkeypox, chickenpox, and measles, to train and evaluate our models. The proposed framework employs the Xception architecture for deep feature extraction, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and the Natural Gradient Boosting (NGBoost) algorithm for classification.

The rendering with GESs consists of two passes -- surfels are first rasterized through a standard graphics pipeline to produce depth and color maps, and then Gaussians are splatted with depth testing and color accumulation on each pixel order independently. The optimization of GESs from multi-view images is performed through an elaborate coarse-to-fine procedure, faithfully capturing rich scene appearance. The entirely sorting-free rendering of GESs not only achieves very fast rates, but also produces view-consistent images, successfully avoiding popping artifacts under view changes. The basic GES representation can be easily extended to achieve anti-aliasing in rendering (Mip-GES), boosted rendering speeds (Speedy-GES) and compact storage (Compact-GES), and reconstruct better scene geometries by replacing 3D Gaussians with 2D Gaussians (2D-GES).

HMAD leverages the distinct feature representation strengths of RGB and depth modalities, giving prominence to a hierarchical approach for feature distribution and fusion, thereby enhancing the robustness of RGB-D tracking. Experimental results on various RGB-D datasets demonstrate that HMAD achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, real-world experiments further validate HMAD's capacity to effectively handle a spectrum of tracking challenges in real-time scenarios.",

    "summary": "Aiming at the problems of poor quality of steganographic images and slow network convergence of image steganography models based on deep learning, this paper proposes a Steganography Curriculum Learning training strategy (STCL) for deep learning image steganography models. So that only easy images are selected for training when the model has poor fitting ability at the initial stage, and gradually expand to more difficult images, the strategy includes a difficulty evaluation strategy based on the teacher model and an knee point-based training scheduling strategy. Firstly, multiple teacher models are trained, and the consistency of the quality of steganographic images under multiple teacher models is used as the difficulty score to construct the training subsets from easy to difficult. Secondly, a training control strategy based on knee points is proposed to reduce the possibility of overfitting on small training sets and accelerate the training process. Experimental results on three large public datasets, ALASKA2, VOC2012 and ImageNet, show that the proposed image steganography scheme is able to improve the model performance under multiple algorithmic frameworks, which not only has a high PSNR, SSIM score, and decoding accuracy, but also the steganographic images generated by the model under the training of the STCL strategy have a low steganography analysis scores.

Towards this end, recent work in this area has focused on improving the characterization of objects either explicitly by proposing new objective functions (localization quality) or implicitly using object-centric auxiliary-information, such as depth information, pixel/region affinity map etc. In this work, we address this problem by incorporating background information to guide the learning of the notion of objectness. Specifically, we propose a novel framework to discover background regions in an image and train an object proposal network to not detect any objects in these regions. We formulate the background discovery task as that of identifying image regions that are not discriminative, i.e., those that are redundant and constitute low information content. We conduct experiments on standard benchmarks to showcase the effectiveness of our proposed approach and observe significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art approaches for this task.",

    "summary": "Visual localization algorithms, i.e., methods that estimate the camera pose of a query image in a known scene, are core components of many applications, including self-driving cars and augmented / mixed reality systems. State-of-the-art visual localization algorithms are structure-based, i.e., they store a 3D model of the scene and use 2D-3D correspondences between the query image and 3D points in the model for camera pose estimation. While such approaches are highly accurate, they are also rather inflexible when it comes to adjusting the underlying 3D model after changes in the scene. Structureless localization approaches represent the scene as a database of images with known poses and thus offer a much more flexible representation that can be easily updated by adding or removing images. Although there is a large amount of literature on structure-based approaches, there is significantly less work on structureless methods. Hence, this paper is dedicated to providing the, to the best of our knowledge, first comprehensive discussion and comparison of structureless methods. Extensive experiments show that approaches that use a higher degree of classical geometric reasoning generally achieve higher pose accuracy. In particular, approaches based on classical absolute or semi-generalized relative pose estimation outperform very recent methods based on pose regression by a wide margin. Compared with state-of-the-art structure-based approaches, the flexibility of structureless methods comes at the cost of (slightly) lower pose accuracy, indicating an interesting direction for future work.",

However, we observe that RGB images often lead to conflicting training objectives and lack the necessary clarity for geometry reconstruction. In this paper, we revisit the inductive biases associated with mesh reconstruction and introduce DiMeR, a novel disentangled dual-stream feed-forward model for sparse-view mesh reconstruction. The key idea is to disentangle both the input and framework into geometry and texture parts, thereby reducing the training difficulty for each part according to the Principle of Occam's Razor. Given that normal maps are strictly consistent with geometry and accurately capture surface variations, we utilize normal maps as exclusive input for the geometry branch to reduce the complexity between the network's input and output. Moreover, we improve the mesh extraction algorithm to introduce 3D ground truth supervision. As for texture branch, we use RGB images as input to obtain the textured mesh. Overall, DiMeR demonstrates robust capabilities across various tasks, including sparse-view reconstruction, single-image-to-3D, and text-to-3D. Numerous experiments show that DiMeR significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving over 30% improvement in Chamfer Distance on the GSO and OmniObject3D dataset.",

    "summary": "Recovering 3D Human-Object Interaction (HOI) from single color images is challenging due to depth ambiguities, occlusions, and the huge variation in object shape and appearance. Thus, past work requires controlled settings such as known object shapes and contacts, and tackles only limited object classes. Instead, we need methods that generalize to natural images and novel object classes. We tackle this in two main ways: (1) We collect PICO-db, a new dataset of natural images uniquely paired with dense 3D contact on both body and object meshes. To this end, we use images from the recent DAMON dataset that are paired with contacts, but these contacts are only annotated on a canonical 3D body. In contrast, we seek contact labels on both the body and the object. To infer these given an image, we retrieve an appropriate 3D object mesh from a database by leveraging vision foundation models. Then, we project DAMON's body contact patches onto the object via a novel method needing only 2 clicks per patch. This minimal human input establishes rich contact correspondences between bodies and objects. (2) We exploit our new dataset of contact correspondences in a novel render-and-compare fitting method, called PICO-fit, to recover 3D body and object meshes in interaction. PICO-fit infers contact for the SMPL-X body, retrieves a likely 3D object mesh and contact from PICO-db for that object, and uses the contact to iteratively fit the 3D body and object meshes to image evidence via optimization. Uniquely, PICO-fit works well for many object categories that no existing method can tackle. This is crucial to enable HOI understanding to scale in the wild.

The dataset annotations and recordings are designed so that 22.7% of L2 actions are shared between L1 activities and 14.2% of L3 procedures are shared between L2 actions. The overlap and unscripted nature of DARai allows counterfactual activities in the dataset.\nExperiments with various machine learning models showcase the value of DARai in uncovering important challenges in human-centered applications. Specifically, we conduct unimodal and multimodal sensor fusion experiments for recognition, temporal localization, and future action anticipation across all hierarchical annotation levels. To highlight the limitations of individual sensors, we also conduct domain-variant experiments that are enabled by DARai's multi-sensor and counterfactual activity design setup.\nThe code, documentation, and dataset are available at the dedicated DARai website: this https URL",

    "summary": "StyleGAN has demonstrated the ability of GANs to synthesize highly-realistic faces of imaginary people from random noise. One limitation of GAN-based image generation is the difficulty of controlling the features of the generated image, due to the strong entanglement of the low-dimensional latent space. Previous work that aimed to control StyleGAN with image or text prompts modulated sampling in W latent space, which is more expressive than Z latent space. However, W space still has restricted expressivity since it does not control the feature synthesis directly; also the feature embedding in W space requires a pre-training process to reconstruct the style signal, limiting its application. This paper introduces the concept of \"generative fields\" to explain the hierarchical feature synthesis in StyleGAN, inspired by the receptive fields of convolution neural networks (CNNs). Additionally, we propose a new image editing pipeline for StyleGAN using generative field theory and the channel-wise style latent space S, utilizing the intrinsic structural feature of CNNs to achieve disentangled control of feature synthesis at synthesis time.",

    "summary": "All-in-One image restoration aims to address multiple image degradation problems using a single model, significantly reducing training costs and deployment complexity compared to traditional methods that design dedicated models for each degradation type. Existing approaches typically rely on Degradation-specific models or coarse-grained degradation prompts to guide image restoration. However, they lack fine-grained modeling of degradation information and face limitations in balancing multi-task conflicts. To overcome these limitations, we propose DPMambaIR, a novel All-in-One image restoration framework. By integrating a Degradation-Aware Prompt State Space Model (DP-SSM) and a High-Frequency Enhancement Block (HEB), DPMambaIR enables fine-grained modeling of complex degradation information and efficient global integration, while mitigating the loss of high-frequency details caused by task competition. Specifically, the DP-SSM utilizes a pre-trained degradation extractor to capture fine-grained degradation features and dynamically incorporates them into the state space modeling process, enhancing the model's adaptability to diverse degradation types. Concurrently, the HEB supplements high-frequency information, effectively addressing the loss of critical details, such as edges and textures, in multi-task image restoration scenarios. Extensive experiments on a mixed dataset containing seven degradation types show that DPMambaIR achieves the best performance, with 27.69dB and 0.893 in PSNR and SSIM, respectively. These results highlight the potential and superiority of DPMambaIR as a unified solution for All-in-One image restoration.",

    "summary": "Autoregressive (AR) models, long dominant in language generation, are increasingly applied to image synthesis but are often considered less competitive than Diffusion-based models. A primary limitation is the substantial number of image tokens required for AR models, which constrains both training and inference efficiency, as well as image resolution. To address this, we present Token-Shuffle, a novel yet simple method that reduces the number of image tokens in Transformer. Our key insight is the dimensional redundancy of visual vocabularies in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where low-dimensional visual codes from visual encoder are directly mapped to high-dimensional language vocabularies. Leveraging this, we consider two key operations: token-shuffle, which merges spatially local tokens along channel dimension to decrease the input token number, and token-unshuffle, which untangles the inferred tokens after Transformer blocks to restore the spatial arrangement for output. Jointly training with textual prompts, our strategy requires no additional pretrained text-encoder and enables MLLMs to support extremely high-resolution image synthesis in a unified next-token prediction way while maintaining efficient training and inference. For the first time, we push the boundary of AR text-to-image generation to a resolution of 2048x2048 with gratifying generation performance. In GenAI-benchmark, our 2.7B model achieves 0.77 overall score on hard prompts, outperforming AR models LlamaGen by 0.18 and diffusion models LDM by 0.15. Exhaustive large-scale human evaluations also demonstrate our prominent image generation ability in terms of text-alignment, visual flaw, and visual appearance. We hope that Token-Shuffle can serve as a foundational design for efficient high-resolution image generation within MLLMs.",

    "summary": "Training diffusion models that work directly on lidar points at the scale of outdoor scenes is challenging due to the difficulty of generating fine-grained details from white noise over a broad field of view. The latest works addressing scene completion with diffusion models tackle this problem by reformulating the original DDPM as a local diffusion process. It contrasts with the common practice of operating at the level of objects, where vanilla DDPMs are currently used. In this work, we close the gap between these two lines of work. We identify approximations in the local diffusion formulation, show that they are not required to operate at the scene level, and that a vanilla DDPM with a well-chosen starting point is enough for completion. Finally, we demonstrate that our method, LiDPM, leads to better results in scene completion on SemanticKITTI. The project page is this https URL .",

Despite their growing popularity, there remains a lack of comprehensive evaluation measuring the audio-visual capabilities of these models, especially in diverse scenarios (e.g., distribution shifts and adversarial attacks). In this paper, we present a multifaceted evaluation of the audio-visual capability of MLLMs, focusing on four key dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, generalizability, and robustness. Through extensive experiments, we find that MLLMs exhibit strong zero-shot and few-shot generalization abilities, enabling them to achieve great performance with limited data. However, their success relies heavily on the vision modality, which impairs performance when visual input is corrupted or missing. Additionally, while MLLMs are susceptible to adversarial samples, they demonstrate greater robustness compared to traditional models. The experimental results and our findings provide insights into the audio-visual capabilities of MLLMs, highlighting areas for improvement and offering guidance for future research.",

This trend raised the exciting possibility that better models of biological vision would come as a byproduct of the deep learning revolution in artificial intelligence. However, the trend has reversed over recent years as DNNs have scaled to human or superhuman recognition accuracy, a divergence that may stem from modern DNNs learning to rely on different visual features than primates to solve tasks. Where will better computational models of biological vision come from? We propose that vision science must break from artificial intelligence to develop algorithms that are designed with biological visual systems in mind instead of internet data benchmarks.

However, existing PBR materials struggle with complex surface models, particularly high-specular and transparent surfaces. In this work, we extend intrinsic image representations to incorporate both reflection and transmission properties, enabling the synthesis of transparent materials such as glass and windows.

Through experiments on DenseNet-BC-100 with CIFAR- 100, EfficientNet-B0 with TinyImageNet and ResNet-34 with ImageNet-1K, we show that maintaining OUI within a prescribed interval correlates strongly with improved generalization and validation scores. Notably, OUI converges significantly faster than traditional metrics such as loss or accuracy, enabling practitioners to identify optimal WD (hyperparameter) values within the early stages of training. By leveraging OUI as a reliable indicator, we can determine early in training whether the chosen WD value leads the model to underfit the training data, overfit, or strike a well-balanced trade-off that maximizes validation scores. This enables more precise WD tuning for optimal performance on the tested datasets and DNNs. All code for reproducing these experiments is available at this https URL.",

(b) Given a group and a subgroup, we study the notion of bandlimited-ness and propose how to perform anti-aliasing. Notably, our method generalizes the notion of downsampling based on classical sampling theory. When the signal is on a cyclic group, i.e., periodic, our method recovers the standard downsampling of an ideal low-pass filter followed by a subsampling operation.

Existing research attributes this issue to group imbalance and addresses it by maximizing group-balanced or worst-group accuracy, which heavily relies on expensive bias annotations. A compromise approach involves predicting bias information using extensively pretrained foundation models, which requires large-scale data and becomes impractical for resource-limited rare domains. To address these challenges, we offer a novel perspective by reframing the spurious correlations as imbalances or mismatches in class-conditional distributions, and propose a simple yet effective robust learning method that eliminates the need for both bias annotations and predictions. With the goal of reducing the mutual information between spurious factors and label information, our method leverages a sample reweighting strategy to achieve class-conditional distribution balancing, which automatically highlights minority groups and classes, effectively dismantling spurious correlations and producing a debiased data distribution for classification. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that our approach consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance, rivaling methods that rely on bias supervision.",

Experimental results demonstrate that MRE can also be observed in the M-MRE task, a multimodal text-image understanding scenario. This provides strong evidence that MRE facilitates mutual gains across three interrelated tasks, confirming its generalizability beyond the textual domain.",

    "summary": "Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising approach for weakly supervised classification in pathology using whole slide images (WSIs). However, conventional MIL methods such as Attention-Based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (ABMIL) typically disregard spatial interactions among patches that are crucial to pathological diagnosis. Recent advancements, such as Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), have incorporated spatial context and inter-patch relationships. However, it remains unclear whether explicitly modeling patch relationships yields similar performance gains in ABMIL, which relies solely on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). In contrast, TransMIL employs Transformer-based layers, introducing a fundamental architectural shift at the cost of substantially increased computational complexity. In this work, we enhance the ABMIL framework by integrating interaction-aware representations to address this question. Our proposed model, Global ABMIL (GABMIL), explicitly captures inter-instance dependencies while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets for tumor subtyping in breast and lung cancers demonstrate that GABMIL achieves up to a 7 percentage point improvement in AUPRC and a 5 percentage point increase in the Kappa score over ABMIL, with minimal or no additional computational overhead. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating patch interactions within MIL frameworks.",

We have previously proposed generalization criteria that rely on the observation that Hessian eigenvalue spectral density (HESD) behaves similarly for a wide class of NNs. This paper further studies their applicability by investigating factors that can result in different types of HESD. We conduct a wide range of experiments showing that HESD mainly has positive eigenvalues (MP-HESD) for NN training and fine-tuning with various optimizers on different datasets with different preprocessing and augmentation procedures. We also show that mainly negative HESD (MN-HESD) is a consequence of external gradient manipulation, indicating that the previously proposed Hessian analysis methodology cannot be applied in such cases. We also propose criteria and corresponding conditions to determine HESD type and estimate NN generalization potential. These HESD types and previously proposed generalization criteria are combined into a unified HESD analysis methodology. Finally, we discuss how HESD changes during training, and show the occurrence of quasi-singular (QS) HESD and its influence on the proposed methodology and on the conventional assumptions about the relation between Hessian eigenvalues and NN loss landscape curvature.",

Unlike conventional deep learning models, which require extensive annotation, ADZUS leverages zero-shot learning to dynamically adapt segmentation based on descriptive prompts, offering enhanced flexibility and adaptability in clinical applications. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that ADZUS surpasses traditional and state-of-the-art segmentation models, achieving an IoU of 86.68\\% and the highest precision of 94.69\\% on the chronic wound dataset, outperforming supervised approaches such as FUSegNet. Further validation on a custom-curated DFU dataset reinforces its robustness, with ADZUS achieving a median DSC of 75\\%, significantly surpassing FUSegNet's 45\\%. The model's text-guided segmentation capability enables real-time customization of segmentation outputs, allowing targeted analysis of wound characteristics based on clinical descriptions. Despite its competitive performance, the computational cost of diffusion-based inference and the need for potential fine-tuning remain areas for future improvement.

    "summary": "This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of conformal prediction methods on a challenging aerial image dataset featuring diverse events in unconstrained environments. Conformal prediction is a powerful post-hoc technique that takes the output of any classifier and transforms it into a set of likely labels, providing a statistical guarantee on the coverage of the true label. Unlike evaluations on standard benchmarks, our study addresses the complexities of data-scarce and highly variable real-world settings. We investigate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained models (MobileNet, DenseNet, and ResNet), fine-tuned with limited labeled data, to generate informative prediction sets. To further evaluate the impact of calibration, we consider two parallel pipelines (with and without temperature scaling) and assess performance using two key metrics: empirical coverage and average prediction set size. This setup allows us to systematically examine how calibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and simple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable uncertainty estimates for complex tasks. Moreover, our analysis reveals that while temperature scaling is often employed for calibration, it does not consistently lead to smaller prediction sets, underscoring the importance of careful consideration in its application. Furthermore, our results highlight the significant potential of model compression techniques within the conformal prediction pipeline for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Based on our observations, we advocate for future research to delve into the impact of noisy or ambiguous labels on conformal prediction performance and to explore effective model reduction strategies.",

However, construction sites present significant challenges for traditional tracking methods due to featureless surfaces, dynamic changes, and drift accumulation, leading to misalignment between digital models and the physical world. This paper proposes a BIM-aware drift correction method to address these challenges. Instead of relying solely on SLAM-based localization, we align ``as-built\" detected planes from the real-world environment with ``as-planned\" architectural planes in BIM. Our method performs robust plane matching and computes a transformation (TF) between SLAM (S) and BIM (B) origin frames using optimization techniques, minimizing drift over time. By incorporating BIM as prior structural knowledge, we can achieve improved long-term localization and enhanced AR visualization accuracy in noisy construction environments. The method is evaluated through real-world experiments, showing significant reductions in drift-induced errors and optimized alignment consistency. On average, our system achieves a reduction of 52.24% in angular deviations and a reduction of 60.8% in the distance error of the matched walls compared to the initial manual alignment by the user.",

    "summary": "When a plasma disrupts in a tokamak, significant heat and electromagnetic loads are deposited onto the surrounding device components. These forces scale with plasma current and magnetic field strength, making disruptions one of the key challenges for future devices. Unfortunately, disruptions are not fully understood, with many different underlying causes that are difficult to anticipate. Data-driven models have shown success in predicting them, but they only provide limited interpretability. On the other hand, large-scale statistical analyses have been a great asset to understanding disruptive patterns. In this paper, we leverage data-driven methods to find an interpretable representation of the plasma state for disruption characterization. Specifically, we use a latent variable model to represent diagnostic measurements as a low-dimensional, latent representation. We build upon the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, and extend it for (1) continuous projections of plasma trajectories; (2) a multimodal structure to separate operating regimes; and (3) separation with respect to disruptive regimes. Subsequently, we can identify continuous indicators for the disruption rate and the disruptivity based on statistical properties of measurement data. The proposed method is demonstrated using a dataset of approximately 1600 TCV discharges, selecting for flat-top disruptions or regular terminations. We evaluate the method with respect to (1) the identified disruption risk and its correlation with other plasma properties; (2) the ability to distinguish different types of disruptions; and (3) downstream analyses. For the latter, we conduct a demonstrative study on identifying parameters connected to disruptions using counterfactual-like analysis. Overall, the method can adequately identify distinct operating regimes characterized by varying proximity to disruptions in an interpretable manner.",

However, most works rely on low dynamic range (LDR) images, which limits the capturing of richer scene details. Some prior works have focused on high dynamic range (HDR) scene reconstruction, typically require capturing of multi-view sharp images with different exposure times at fixed camera positions during exposure times, which is time-consuming and challenging in practice. For a more flexible data acquisition, we propose a one-stage method: \\textbf{CasualHDRSplat} to easily and robustly reconstruct the 3D HDR scene from casually captured videos with auto-exposure enabled, even in the presence of severe motion blur and varying unknown exposure time. \\textbf{CasualHDRSplat} contains a unified differentiable physical imaging model which first applies continuous-time trajectory constraint to imaging process so that we can jointly optimize exposure time, camera response function (CRF), camera poses, and sharp 3D HDR scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness and rendering quality. Our source code will be available at this https URL",

We highlight a research gap in radiance fields style transfer, the lack of sufficient perceptual controllability, motivated by the existing concept in the 2D image style transfer. In this paper, we present ARF-Plus, a 3D neural style transfer framework offering manageable control over perceptual factors, to systematically explore the perceptual controllability in 3D scene stylization. Four distinct types of controls - color preservation control, (style pattern) scale control, spatial (selective stylization area) control, and depth enhancement control - are proposed and integrated into this framework. Results from real-world datasets, both quantitative and qualitative, show that the four types of controls in our ARF-Plus framework successfully accomplish their corresponding perceptual controls when stylizing 3D scenes. These techniques work well for individual style inputs as well as for the simultaneous application of multiple styles within a scene. This unlocks a realm of limitless possibilities, allowing customized modifications of stylization effects and flexible merging of the strengths of different styles, ultimately enabling the creation of novel and eye-catching stylistic effects on 3D scenes.",

In this study, we introduce the utility of Duke Lung Cancer Screening (DLCS) Dataset, the largest open-access LDCT dataset with over 2,000 scans and 3,000 expert-verified nodules. We benchmark deep learning models for both 3D nodule detection and lung cancer classification across internal and external datasets including LUNA16, LUNA25, and NLST-3D+. For detection, we develop two MONAI-based RetinaNet models (DLCSDmD and LUNA16-mD), evaluated using the Competition Performance Metric (CPM). For classification, we compare five models, including state-of-the-art pretrained models (Models Genesis, Med3D), a selfsupervised foundation model (FMCB), a randomly initialized ResNet50, and proposed a novel Strategic Warm-Start++ (SWS++) model. SWS++ uses curated candidate patches to pretrain a classification backbone within the same detection pipeline, enabling task-relevant feature learning. Our models demonstrated strong generalizability, with SWS++ achieving comparable or superior performance to existing foundational models across multiple datasets (AUC: 0.71 to 0.90).

However, training the attention weights of queries, keys, and values is non-trivial from a state of random initialization. In this paper, we propose two methods. (i) We first address the initialization problem of Vision Transformers by introducing a simple, yet highly innovative, initialization approach utilizing discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients. Our proposed DCT-based \\textit{attention} initialization marks a significant gain compared to traditional initialization strategies; offering a robust foundation for the attention mechanism. Our experiments reveal that the DCT-based initialization enhances the accuracy of Vision Transformers in classification tasks. (ii) We also recognize that since DCT effectively decorrelates image information in the frequency domain, this decorrelation is useful for compression because it allows the quantization step to discard many of the higher-frequency components. Based on this observation, we propose a novel DCT-based compression technique for the attention function of Vision Transformers. Since high-frequency DCT coefficients usually correspond to noise, we truncate the high-frequency DCT components of the input patches. Our DCT-based compression reduces the size of weight matrices for queries, keys, and values. While maintaining the same level of accuracy, our DCT compressed Swin Transformers obtain a considerable decrease in the computational overhead.",

In this paper, we propose a more accurate, concise, and one-stage Retinex theory based framework, RSEND. RSEND first divides the low-light image into the illumination map and reflectance map, then captures the important details in the illumination map and performs light enhancement. After this step, it refines the enhanced gray-scale image and does element-wise matrix multiplication with the reflectance map. By denoising the output it has from the previous step, it obtains the final result. In all the steps, RSEND utilizes Squeeze and Excitation network to better capture the details. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our Efficient Retinex model significantly outperforms other CNN-based models, achieving a PSNR improvement ranging from 0.44 dB to 4.2 dB in different datasets and even outperforms transformer-based models in the LOL-v2-real dataset.",

    "summary": "The segmentation of ultra-high resolution images poses challenges such as loss of spatial information or computational inefficiency. In this work, a novel approach that combines encoder-decoder architectures with domain decomposition strategies to address these challenges is proposed. Specifically, a domain decomposition-based U-Net (DDU-Net) architecture is introduced, which partitions input images into non-overlapping patches that can be processed independently on separate devices. A communication network is added to facilitate inter-patch information exchange to enhance the understanding of spatial context. Experimental validation is performed on a synthetic dataset that is designed to measure the effectiveness of the communication network. Then, the performance is tested on the DeepGlobe land cover classification dataset as a real-world benchmark data set. The results demonstrate that the approach, which includes inter-patch communication for images divided into $16\\times16$ non-overlapping subimages, achieves a $2-3\\,\\%$ higher intersection over union (IoU) score compared to the same network without inter-patch communication. The performance of the network which includes communication is equivalent to that of a baseline U-Net trained on the full image, showing that our model provides an effective solution for segmenting ultra-high-resolution images while preserving spatial context.

    "summary": "Sequential multiple-instance learning involves learning representations of sets distributed across discrete timesteps. In many real-world applications, modeling both the internal structure of sets and their temporal relationships across time is essential for capturing complex underlying patterns. However, existing methods either focus on learning set representations at a static level, ignoring temporal dynamics, or treat sequences as ordered lists of individual elements, lacking explicit mechanisms to represent sets. In this work, we propose Set2Seq Transformer, a novel architecture that jointly models permutation-invariant set structure and temporal dependencies by learning temporal and positional-aware representations of sets within a sequence in an end-to-end multimodal manner. We evaluate our Set2Seq Transformer on two tasks that require modeling both set structure alongside temporal and positional patterns, but differ significantly in domain, modality, and objective. First, we consider a fine-art analysis task, modeling artists' oeuvres for predicting artistic success using a novel dataset, WikiArt-Seq2Rank. Second, we utilize our Set2Seq Transformer for a short-term wildfire danger forecasting task. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our Set2Seq Transformer significantly improves over traditional static multiple-instance learning methods by effectively learning permutation-invariant set, temporal, and positional-aware representations across diverse domains, modalities, and tasks. We will release both the dataset and model implementations on GitHub.",

In order to address this essential issue and enhance the safety and efficiency of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) at multi-lane merging zones, we propose a novel collaborative decision-making framework, named AgentsCoMerge, to leverage large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we first design a scene observation and understanding module to allow an agent to capture the traffic environment. Then we propose a hierarchical planning module to enable the agent to make decisions and plan trajectories based on the observation and the agent's own state. In addition, in order to facilitate collaboration among multiple agents, we introduce a communication module to enable the surrounding agents to exchange necessary information and coordinate their actions. Finally, we develop a reinforcement reflection guided training paradigm to further enhance the decision-making capability of the framework. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed method, demonstrating its superior efficiency and effectiveness for multi-agent collaborative decision-making under various ramp merging scenarios.",

However, its efficacy is constrained as the nearest neighbor algorithm primarily identifies \"easy\" positive pairs, where the representations are already closely located in the embedding space. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Contrastive Learning with Synthetic Positives (CLSP) that utilizes synthetic images, generated by an unconditional diffusion model, as the additional positives to help the model learn from diverse positives. Through feature interpolation in the diffusion model sampling process, we generate images with distinct backgrounds yet similar semantic content to the anchor image. These images are considered \"hard\" positives for the anchor image, and when included as supplementary positives in the contrastive loss, they contribute to a performance improvement of over 2% and 1% in linear evaluation compared to the previous NNCLR and All4One methods across multiple benchmark datasets such as CIFAR10, achieving state-of-the-art methods. On transfer learning benchmarks, CLSP outperforms existing SSL frameworks on 6 out of 8 downstream datasets. We believe CLSP establishes a valuable baseline for future SSL studies incorporating synthetic data in the training process.",

The Earth observation (EO) field has produced several foundation models pre-trained directly on multispectral satellite imagery for applications like precision agriculture, wildfire and drought monitoring, and natural disaster response. However, few studies have investigated the ability of these models to generalize to new geographic locations, and potential concerns of geospatial bias -- models trained on data-rich developed nations not transferring well to data-scarce developing nations -- remain. We investigate the ability of popular EO foundation models to transfer to new geographic regions in the agricultural domain, where differences in farming practices and class imbalance make transfer learning particularly challenging. We first select five crop classification datasets across five continents, normalizing for dataset size and harmonizing classes to focus on four major cereal grains: maize, soybean, rice, and wheat. We then compare three popular foundation models, pre-trained on SSL4EO-S12, SatlasPretrain, and ImageNet, using in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation. Experiments show that pre-trained weights designed explicitly for Sentinel-2, such as SSL4EO-S12, outperform general pre-trained weights like ImageNet. Furthermore, while only 100 labeled images are sufficient for achieving high overall accuracy, 900 images are required to achieve high average accuracy due to class imbalance.

DiffKillR employs two complementary neural networks: one that learns a diffeomorphism-invariant feature space for robust cell matching and another that computes the precise warping field between cells for annotation mapping. Using a small set of annotated archetypes, DiffKillR efficiently propagates annotations across large microscopy images, reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. More importantly, it is suitable for any type of pixel-level annotation. We will discuss the theoretical properties of DiffKillR and validate it on three microscopy tasks, demonstrating its advantages over existing supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised methods.

However, these metrics emphasize visual quality and smoothness, neglecting temporal fidelity and text-to-video alignment, which are crucial for safety-critical applications. To address this gap, we introduce NeuS-V, a novel synthetic video evaluation metric that rigorously assesses text-to-video alignment using neuro-symbolic formal verification techniques. Our approach first converts the prompt into a formally defined Temporal Logic (TL) specification and translates the generated video into an automaton representation. Then, it evaluates the text-to-video alignment by formally checking the video automaton against the TL specification. Furthermore, we present a dataset of temporally extended prompts to evaluate state-of-the-art video generation models against our benchmark. We find that NeuS-V demonstrates a higher correlation by over 5x with human evaluations when compared to existing metrics. Our evaluation further reveals that current video generation models perform poorly on these temporally complex prompts, highlighting the need for future work in improving text-to-video generation capabilities.",

However, there are some situations in which quantitative features of the artwork can support these evaluations. The extraction of these features can sometimes be automated, for instance, with the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. An example of these features is represented by repeated, mechanically impressed patterns, called punches, present chiefly in 13th and 14th-century panel paintings from Tuscany. Previous research in art history showcased a strong connection between the shapes of punches and specific artists or workshops, suggesting the possibility of using these quantitative cues to support the attribution. In the present work, we first collect a dataset of large-scale images of these panel paintings. Then, using YOLOv10, a recent and popular object detection model, we train a ML pipeline to perform object detection on the punches contained in the images. Due to the large size of the images, the detection procedure is split across multiple frames by adopting a sliding-window approach with overlaps, after which the predictions are combined for the whole image using a custom non-maximal suppression routine. Our results indicate how art historians working in the field can reliably use our method for the identification and extraction of punches.",

    "summary": "Volumetric rendering has become central to modern novel view synthesis methods, which use differentiable rendering to optimize 3D scene representations directly from observed views. While many recent works build on NeRF or 3D Gaussians, we explore an alternative volumetric scene representation. More specifically, we introduce two new scene representations based on linear primitives - octahedra and tetrahedra - both of which define homogeneous volumes bounded by triangular faces. To optimize these primitives, we present a differentiable rasterizer that runs efficiently on GPUs, allowing end-to-end gradient-based optimization while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities. Through experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate comparable performance to state-of-the-art volumetric methods while requiring fewer primitives to achieve similar reconstruction fidelity. Our findings deepen the understanding of 3D representations by providing insights into the fidelity and performance characteristics of transparent polyhedra and suggest that adopting novel primitives can expand the available design space.",

    "summary": "Demographic fairness in face recognition (FR) has emerged as a critical area of research, given its impact on fairness, equity, and reliability across diverse applications. As FR technologies are increasingly deployed globally, disparities in performance across demographic groups-- such as race, ethnicity, and gender-- have garnered significant attention. These biases not only compromise the credibility of FR systems but also raise ethical concerns, especially when these technologies are employed in sensitive domains. This review consolidates extensive research efforts providing a comprehensive overview of the multifaceted aspects of demographic fairness in FR.\nWe systematically examine the primary causes, datasets, assessment metrics, and mitigation approaches associated with demographic disparities in FR. By categorizing key contributions in these areas, this work provides a structured approach to understanding and addressing the complexity of this issue. Finally, we highlight current advancements and identify emerging challenges that need further investigation. This article aims to provide researchers with a unified perspective on the state-of-the-art while emphasizing the critical need for equitable and trustworthy FR systems.",

One of the main obstacles to the interpretation of transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which mixes visual information across the whole image in a complex way. In this paper, we propose Hindered Transformer (HiT), a novel interpretable by design architecture inspired by visual transformers. Our proposed architecture rethinks the design of transformers to better disentangle patch influences at the classification stage. Ultimately, HiT can be interpreted as a linear combination of patch-level information.

To address these challenges, we introduce HierarQ, a task-aware hierarchical Q-Former based framework that sequentially processes frames to bypass the need for frame sampling, while avoiding LLM's context length limitations. We introduce a lightweight two-stream language-guided feature modulator to incorporate task awareness in video understanding, with the entity stream capturing frame-level object information within a short context and the scene stream identifying their broader interactions over longer period of time. Each stream is supported by dedicated memory banks which enables our proposed Hierachical Querying transformer (HierarQ) to effectively capture short and long-term context. Extensive evaluations on 10 video benchmarks across video understanding, question answering, and captioning tasks demonstrate HierarQ's state-of-the-art performance across most datasets, proving its robustness and efficiency for comprehensive video analysis.",

    "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various vision-language (VL) tasks, but their expensive computations still limit the real-world application. To address this issue, recent efforts aim to compress the visual features to save the computational costs of MLLMs. However, direct visual compression methods, e.g. efficient projectors, inevitably destroy the visual semantics in MLLM, especially in difficult samples. To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a novel dynamic pyramid network (DPN) for efficient MLLMs. Specifically, DPN formulates MLLM as a hierarchical structure where visual features are gradually compressed with increasing depth. In this case, even with a high compression ratio, fine-grained visual information can still be perceived in shallow layers. To maximize the benefit of DPN, we further propose an innovative Dynamic Pooling Experts (DPE) that can dynamically choose the optimal visual compression rate according to input features. With this design, harder samples will be assigned larger computations, thus preserving the model performance. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on two popular MLLMs and ten benchmarks. Experimental results show that DPN can save up to 56% average FLOPs on LLaVA while further achieving +0.74% performance gains. Besides, the generalization ability of DPN is also validated on the existing high-resolution MLLM called LLaVA-HR. The source code will be released at this https URL.",

Consequently, multimodal fake news detection has garnered significant research attention. However, existing datasets predominantly comprise user-generated videos characterized by crude editing and limited public engagement, whereas professionally crafted fake news videos disseminated by media outlets, often politically or virally motivated-pose substantially greater societal harm. To address this gap, we construct FMNV, a novel dataset exclusively composed of news videos published by media organizations. Through empirical analysis of existing datasets and our curated collection, we categorize fake news videos into four distinct types. Building upon this taxonomy, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate deceptive content by manipulating authentic media-published news videos. Furthermore, we propose FMNVD, a baseline model featuring a dual-stream architecture integrating CLIP and Faster R-CNN for video feature extraction, enhanced by co-attention mechanisms for feature refinement and multimodal aggregation. Comparative experiments demonstrate both the generalization capability of FMNV across multiple baselines and the superior detection efficacy of FMNVD. This work establishes critical benchmarks for detecting high-impact fake news in media ecosystems while advancing methodologies for cross-modal inconsistency analysis.",

Additionally, to fully leverage the information in limited data, such as anatomical structure information and generate more structurally stable medical images while avoiding distortion or inconsistency. In this paper, in order to enhance the clinical relevance of generated data and improve the interpretability of the model, we propose a novel medical image generation framework, which generates independent pathological and structural features based on causal disentanglement and utilizes text-guided modeling of pathological features to regulate the generation of counterfactual images. First, we achieve feature separation through causal disentanglement and analyze the interactions between features. Here, we introduce group supervision to ensure the independence of pathological and identity features. Second, we leverage a diffusion model guided by pathological findings to model pathological features, enabling the generation of diverse counterfactual images. Meanwhile, we enhance accuracy by leveraging a large language model to extract lesion severity and location from medical reports. Additionally, we improve the performance of the latent diffusion model on long-tailed categories through initial noise optimization.",

    "summary": "Humans naturally share information with those they are connected to, and video has become one of the dominant mediums for communication and expression on the Internet. To support the creation of high-quality large-scale video content, a modern pipeline requires a comprehensive understanding of both the raw input materials (e.g., the unedited footage captured by cameras) and the editing components (e.g., visual effects). In video editing scenarios, models must process multiple modalities (e.g., vision, audio, text) with strong background knowledge and handle flexible input lengths (e.g., hour-long raw videos), which poses significant challenges for traditional models. In this report, we introduce Vidi, a family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for a wide range of video understand editing scenarios. The first release focuses on temporal retrieval, i.e., identifying the time ranges within the input videos corresponding to a given text query, which plays a critical role in intelligent editing. The model is capable of processing hour-long videos with strong temporal understanding capability, e.g., retrieve time ranges for certain queries. To support a comprehensive evaluation in real-world scenarios, we also present the VUE-TR benchmark, which introduces five key advancements. 1) Video duration: significantly longer than videos of existing temporal retrival datasets, 2) Audio support: includes audio-based queries, 3) Query format: diverse query lengths/formats, 4) Annotation quality: ground-truth time ranges are manually annotated. 5) Evaluation metric: a refined IoU metric to support evaluation over multiple time ranges. Remarkably, Vidi significantly outperforms leading proprietary models, e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini, on the temporal retrieval task, indicating its superiority in video editing scenarios.",

    "summary": "Diagnostic imaging relies on interpreting both images and radiology reports, but the growing data volumes place significant pressure on medical experts, yielding increased errors and workflow backlogs. Medical vision-language models (med-VLMs) have emerged as a powerful framework to efficiently process multimodal imaging data, particularly in chest X-ray (CXR) evaluations, albeit their performance hinges on how well image and text representations are aligned. Existing alignment methods, predominantly based on contrastive learning, prioritize separation between disease classes over segregation of fine-grained pathology attributes like location, size or severity, leading to suboptimal representations. Here, we propose MedTrim (Meta-entity-driven Triplet mining), a novel method that enhances image-text alignment through multimodal triplet learning synergistically guided by disease class as well as adjectival and directional pathology descriptors. Unlike common alignment methods that separate broad disease classes, MedTrim leverages structured meta-entity information to preserve subtle but clinically significant intra-class variations. For this purpose, we first introduce an ontology-based entity recognition module that extracts pathology-specific meta-entities from CXR reports, as annotations on pathology attributes are rare in public datasets. For refined sample selection in triplet mining, we then introduce a novel score function that captures an aggregate measure of inter-sample similarity based on disease classes and adjectival/directional descriptors. Lastly, we introduce a multimodal triplet alignment objective for explicit within- and cross-modal alignment between samples sharing detailed pathology characteristics. Our demonstrations indicate that MedTrim improves performance in downstream retrieval and classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art alignment methods.",

    "summary": "Optimizing the similarity between parametric shapes is crucial for numerous computer vision tasks, where Intersection over Union (IoU) stands as the canonical measure. However, existing optimization methods exhibit significant shortcomings: regression-based losses like L1/L2 lack correlation with IoU, IoU-based losses are unstable and limited to simple shapes, and task-specific methods are computationally intensive and not generalizable accross domains. As a result, the current landscape of parametric shape objective functions has become scattered, with each domain proposing distinct IoU approximations. To address this, we unify the parametric shape optimization objective functions by introducing Marginalized Generalized IoU (MGIoU), a novel loss function that overcomes these challenges by projecting structured convex shapes onto their unique shape Normals to compute one-dimensional normalized GIoU. MGIoU offers a simple, efficient, fully differentiable approximation strongly correlated with IoU. We then extend MGIoU to MGIoU+ that supports optimizing unstructured convex shapes. Together, MGIoU and MGIoU+ unify parametric shape optimization across diverse applications. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that MGIoU and MGIoU+ consistently outperform existing losses while reducing loss computation latency by 10-40x. Additionally, MGIoU and MGIoU+ satisfy metric properties and scale-invariance, ensuring robustness as an objective function. We further propose MGIoU- for minimizing overlaps in tasks like collision-free trajectory prediction. Code is available at this https URL",

To identify the source of these vulnerabilities, we present a systematic framework for component-level analysis, featuring a novel visualization approach for aligned visual features.

    "summary": "Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has been widely used for crossmodal information retrieval and multimodal understanding tasks. However, CLIP models are mainly optimized for crossmodal vision-language tasks and underperform in single-mode text tasks. Moreover, these models are often trained on English datasets and therefore lack multilingual understanding. Additionally, from a visual understanding perspective, previous CLIP-based models exhibit insufficient understanding of visually rich documents. In this work, we propose jina-clip-v2, a contrastive vision-language model trained on text pairs, triplets and image-text pairs via a multi-task and multi-stage contrastive learning paradigm in order to support both text-only and crossmodal tasks. We employ a multilingual text encoder and expand the training dataset to include multilingual texts from 29 non-English languages, including Hindi, Chinese, German, French, and others, as well as images of visually rich documents. We evaluate the model's performance and show that jina-clip-v2 achieves notable improvements over state-of-the-art CLIP-based models in zero-shot text-only retrieval, semantic textual similarity, and crossmodal retrieval tasks in both English and multilingual settings. jina-clip-v2 also provides for flexibility in embedding dimensionality, enabling users to select the granularity of the representations. jina-clip-v2 is publicly available at this https URL.",

    "summary": "This paper addresses the inherent inference latency challenges associated with deploying multimodal large language models (MLLM) in quadruped vision-language-action (QUAR-VLA) tasks. Our investigation reveals that conventional parameter reduction techniques ultimately impair the performance of the language foundation model during the action instruction tuning phase, making them unsuitable for this purpose. We introduce a novel latency-free quadruped MLLM model, dubbed QUART-Online, designed to enhance inference efficiency without degrading the performance of the language foundation model. By incorporating Action Chunk Discretization (ACD), we compress the original action representation space, mapping continuous action values onto a smaller set of discrete representative vectors while preserving critical information. Subsequently, we fine-tune the MLLM to integrate vision, language, and compressed actions into a unified semantic space. Experimental results demonstrate that QUART-Online operates in tandem with the existing MLLM system, achieving real-time inference in sync with the underlying controller frequency, significantly boosting the success rate across various tasks by 65%.

    "summary": "The goal of diffusion generative models is to align the learned distribution with the real data distribution through gradient score matching. However, inherent limitations in training data quality, modeling strategies, and architectural design lead to inevitable gap between generated outputs and real data. To reduce this gap, we propose Weak-to-Strong Diffusion (W2SD), a novel framework that utilizes the estimated difference between existing weak and strong models (i.e., weak-to-strong difference) to bridge the gap between an ideal model and a strong model. By employing a reflective operation that alternates between denoising and inversion with weak-to-strong difference, we theoretically understand that W2SD steers latent variables along sampling trajectories toward regions of the real data distribution. W2SD is highly flexible and broadly applicable, enabling diverse improvements through the strategic selection of weak-to-strong model pairs (e.g., DreamShaper vs. SD1.5, good experts vs. bad experts in MoE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that W2SD significantly improves human preference, aesthetic quality, and prompt adherence, achieving SOTA performance across various modalities (e.g., image, video), architectures (e.g., UNet-based, DiT-based, MoE), and benchmarks. For example, Juggernaut-XL with W2SD can improve with the HPSv2 winning rate up to 90% over the original results. Moreover, the performance gains achieved by W2SD markedly outweigh its additional computational overhead, while the cumulative improvements from different weak-to-strong difference further solidify its practical utility and deployability.",

    "summary": "We present Variational Self-Supervised Learning (VSSL), a novel framework that combines variational inference with self-supervised learning to enable efficient, decoder-free representation learning. Unlike traditional VAEs that rely on input reconstruction via a decoder, VSSL symmetrically couples two encoders with Gaussian outputs. A momentum-updated teacher network defines a dynamic, data-dependent prior, while the student encoder produces an approximate posterior from augmented views. The reconstruction term in the ELBO is replaced with a cross-view denoising objective, preserving the analytical tractability of Gaussian KL divergence. We further introduce cosine-based formulations of KL and log-likelihood terms to enhance semantic alignment in high-dimensional latent spaces. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 show that VSSL achieves competitive or superior performance to leading self-supervised methods, including BYOL and MoCo V3. VSSL offers a scalable, probabilistically grounded approach to learning transferable representations without generative reconstruction, bridging the gap between variational modeling and modern self-supervised techniques.",

To address this gap, we propose OmniMamba4D, a novel segmentation model designed for 4D medical images (3D images over time). OmniMamba4D utilizes a spatio-temporal tetra-orientated Mamba block to effectively capture both spatial and temporal features. Unlike traditional 3D models, which analyze single-time points, OmniMamba4D processes 4D CT data, providing comprehensive spatio-temporal information on lesion progression. Evaluated on an internal dataset comprising of 3,252 CT scans, OmniMamba4D achieves a competitive Dice score of 0.682, comparable to state-of-the-arts (SOTA) models, while maintaining computational efficiency and better detecting disappeared lesions. This work demonstrates a new framework to leverage spatio-temporal information for longitudinal CT lesion segmentation.",

    "summary": "Menisci are cartilaginous tissue found within the knee that contribute to joint lubrication and weight dispersal. Damage to menisci can lead to onset and progression of knee osteoarthritis (OA), a condition that is a leading cause of disability, and for which there are few effective therapies. Accurate automated segmentation of menisci would allow for earlier detection and treatment of meniscal abnormalities, as well as shedding more light on the role the menisci play in OA pathogenesis. Focus in this area has mainly used variants of convolutional networks, but there has been no attempt to utilise recent large vision transformer segmentation models. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a so-called foundation segmentation model, which has been found useful across a range of different tasks due to the large volume of data used for training the model. In this study, SAM was adapted to perform fully-automated segmentation of menisci from 3D knee magnetic resonance images. A 3D U-Net was also trained as a baseline. It was found that, when fine-tuning only the decoder, SAM was unable to compete with 3D U-Net, achieving a Dice score of $0.81\\pm0.03$, compared to $0.87\\pm0.03$, on a held-out test set. When fine-tuning SAM end-to-end, a Dice score of $0.87\\pm0.03$ was achieved. The performance of both the end-to-end trained SAM configuration and the 3D U-Net were comparable to the winning Dice score ($0.88\\pm0.03$) in the IWOAI Knee MRI Segmentation Challenge 2019. Performance in terms of the Hausdorff Distance showed that both configurations of SAM were inferior to 3D U-Net in matching the meniscus morphology. Results demonstrated that, despite its generalisability, SAM was unable to outperform a basic 3D U-Net in meniscus segmentation, and may not be suitable for similar 3D medical image segmentation tasks also involving fine anatomical structures with low contrast and poorly-defined boundaries.",

The grammars can represent iterative, hierarchical and nested recursive structure in more than one dimension.\nThis supports a highly parallel style of parsing, in which all aspects of pattern recognition (feature detection, segmentation, parsing, filling in missing symbols, top-down and bottom-up inference) are integrated into a single process, to exploit the synergy between them.\nThe emphasis of this paper is on underlying theoretical issues, but I also give some example runs to illustrate the error-tolerant parsing of complex recursively structured patterns of 50-1000 symbols, involving variability in geometric relationships, blurry and indistinct symbols, overlapping symbols, cluttered images, and erased patches.",

These assumptions are usually calibrated on the technical characteristics of the units, such as installed capacity or technology type. However, even if power generation units technically can dispatch flexibly, service obligations and market incentives may constrain their operation. Here, we cluster over 60% of German national gas generation (generation units of 100 MWp or above) based on their empirical flexibility. We process the hourly dispatch of sample units between 2019 and 2023 using a novel deep learning approach, that transforms time series into easy-to-cluster representations. We identify two clusters of peaker units and two clusters of non-peaker units, whose different empirical flexibility is quantified by cluster-level ramp rates. Non-peaker units, around half of the sample, are empirically less flexible than peakers, and make up for more than 83% of sample must-run generation. Regulatory changes addressing the low market responsiveness of non-peakers are needed to unlock their flexibility.",

    "summary": "Computer science education has seen two important trends. One has been a shift from raw theory towards skills: competency-based teaching. Another has been increasing student numbers, with as a result more automation in teaching. When automating education, it is crucial to properly structure courses, both to manage digitalized educational resources and to facilitate automated coaching algorithms. Currently existing structuring methodologies are focused around theory and not around skills, and are incapable of modeling the dependency links between skills. Because of this, a new didactic framework is needed.\nThis paper presents a new method of structuring educational contents around skills: something that a student is expected to be able to do. It defines Skill Trees that show dependencies between skills, and subsequently couples these to Concept Trees that contain intuitive ideas/notional machines. Due to the algorithmic nature of computer science, this step-wise approach is especially well-suited to this field of education. Next to formal definitions on Skill Trees and Concept Trees, guidelines are given on how to design them and how to plan a course using them.\nThe Skill Trees framework has been applied to improve the structure of a university database course. Student interviews indicated reduced confusion/stress and less study time required for students to meet their desired skill level.",

    "summary": "Organizations developing machine learning-based (ML) technologies face the complex challenge of achieving high predictive performance while respecting the law. This intersection between ML and the law creates new complexities. As ML model behavior is inferred from training data, legal obligations cannot be operationalized in source code directly. Rather, legal obligations require \"indirect\" operationalization. However, choosing context-appropriate operationalizations presents two compounding challenges: (1) laws often permit multiple valid operationalizations for a given legal obligation-each with varying degrees of legal adequacy; and, (2) each operationalization creates unpredictable trade-offs among the different legal obligations and with predictive performance. Evaluating these trade-offs requires metrics (or heuristics), which are in turn difficult to validate against legal obligations. Current methodologies fail to fully address these interwoven challenges as they either focus on legal compliance for traditional software or on ML model development without adequately considering legal complexities. In response, we introduce a five-stage interdisciplinary framework that integrates legal and ML-technical analysis during ML model development. This framework facilitates designing ML models in a legally aligned way and identifying high-performing models that are legally justifiable. Legal reasoning guides choices for operationalizations and evaluation metrics, while ML experts ensure technical feasibility, performance optimization and an accurate interpretation of metric values. This framework bridges the gap between more conceptual analysis of law and ML models' need for deterministic specifications. We illustrate its application using a case study in the context of anti-money laundering.",

    "summary": "This study proposes a prototype for locating important individuals and financial exchanges in networks of people trafficking that have grown during the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. It focuses on the role of digital platforms, cryptocurrencies, and the dark web in facilitating these operations. The research maps trafficking networks and identifies key players and financial flows by utilizing open-source intelligence (OSINT), social network analysis (SNA), and blockchain analysis. The results show how cryptocurrencies are used for anonymous transactions and imply that upsetting central coordinators may cause wider networks to become unstable. In order to combat human trafficking, the study emphasizes the significance of real-time data sharing between international law enforcement. It also identifies future directions for the development of improved monitoring tools and cooperative platforms.",

This paper explores the application of Cyber Value-at-Risk (Cy-VaR) models to assess and mitigate cybersecurity risks in IoT environments. Cy-VaR, rooted in Value at Risk principles, provides a framework to quantify the potential financial impacts of cybersecurity incidents. Initially developed to evaluate overall risk exposure across scenarios, our approach extends Cy-VaR to consider specific IoT layers: perception, network, and application. Each layer encompasses distinct functionalities and vulnerabilities, from sensor data acquisition (perception layer) to secure data transmission (network layer) and application-specific services (application layer). By calculating Cy- VaR for each layer and scenario, organizations can prioritize security investments effectively. This paper discusses methodologies and models, including scenario-based Cy-VaR and layer-specific risk assessments, emphasizing their application in enhancing IoT cybersecurity resilience.",

    "summary": "Energy-poor households often compromise their thermal comfort and refrain from operating mechanical cooling devices to avoid high electricity bills. This is compounded by certain behavioral practices like retention of older, less efficient appliances, resulting in missed energy savings. Thus, the need to enhance efficiency becomes critical in these households. However, due to a lack of comprehensive data in India, little is understood about their electricity consumption patterns and usage efficiency. Estimating inefficiency and assessing its determinants is crucial for improving their quality of life. This study measures the inefficiency in electricity consumption due to household practices and appliances in social housing in Mumbai, India. It considers technological determinants in addition to socio-economic variables. The study employs primary data collected from rehabilitation housing and slums in Mumbai. Stochastic frontier analysis, a parametric approach, is applied to estimate indicators of electricity consumption and inefficiency. While household size and workforce participation significantly affect consumption behavior in rehabilitation housing, it is limited to the workforce in slums. The ownership of appliances, except for washing machines in slums, also exhibits considerable impacts. The mean efficiency scores of 83% and 91% for rehabilitation housing and slums, respectively, empirically quantify the potential savings achievable. Factors that positively influence inefficiency include the duration of operating refrigerators, washing machines, iron, and AC. These results hold implications for enhancing the uptake of efficient appliances in addition to accelerating energy efficiency retrofits in the region. Policies should focus on awareness and the development of appliance markets through incentives.",

Together, these mechanisms operationalize cybernetic principles--human sensing, machine bookkeeping, real-time feedback--while minimizing dependence on privileged roles.\nOur exploratory data (567 chore claims, 255 heart events, and 551 group purchases) show that such tooling can sustain reliable commons governance without continuous leadership, offering a transferable design palette for online communities, coliving houses, and other digitally mediated collectives.",

    "summary": "The premise of network statistics derived from Google Trends data to foresee COVID-19 disease progression is gaining momentum in infodemiology. This approach was applied in Metro Manila, National Capital Region, Philippines. Through dynamic time warping (DTW), the temporal alignment was quantified between network metrics and COVID-19 case trajectories, and systematically explored 320 parameter configurations including two network metrics (network density and clustering coefficient), two data preprocessing methods (Rescaling Daily Data and MSV), multiple thresholds, two correlation window sizes, and Sakoe-Chiba band constraints. Results from the Kruskal-Wallis tests revealed that five of the six parameters significantly influenced alignment quality, with the disease comparison type (active cases vs. confirmed cases) demonstrating the strongest effect. The optimal configuration, which is using the network density statistic with a Rescaling Daily Data transformation, a threshold of 0.8, a 15-day window, and a 50-day radius constraint, achieved a DTW score of 36.30. This indicated substantial temporal alignment with the COVID-19 confirmed cases data. The discoveries demonstrate that network metrics rooted from online search behavior can serve as complementary indicators for epidemic surveillance in urban locations like Metro Manila. This strategy leverages the Philippines' extensive online usage during the pandemic to provide potentially valuable early signals of disease spread, and offers a supplementary tool for public health monitoring in resource-limited situations.",

Building on Carl Jung's theory of psychological types, which categorizes human cognition into four primary functions, Sensing, Intuition, Thinking, and Feeling, this study investigates how these functions, when combined with the attitudes of Extraversion and Introversion, influence personality types and career choices in the tech sector. Through a comprehensive analysis of data from 30 studies spanning multiple countries and decades, encompassing 18,264 individuals in computer-related professions, we identified the most prevalent cognitive functions and their combinations. After normalizing the data against general population distributions, our findings showed that individual Jungian functions (Te, Ni, Ti, Ne), dual function combinations (Ni-Te, Ti-Ne, Si-Te, Ni-Fe), and MBTI types (INTJ, ENTJ, INTP, ENTP, ISTJ, INFJ, ESTJ, ESTP) had significantly higher representation compared to general population norms. The paper addresses gaps in the existing literature by providing a more nuanced understanding of how cognitive functions impact job performance and team dynamics, offering insights for career guidance, team composition, and professional development in the computer industry, and a deeper understanding of how cognitive preferences influence career success in technology-related fields.",

To address this gap, we conducted qualitative research on decision-making within a law enforcement agency. Our study aimed to identify limitations of existing practices, explore user requirements and understand the responsibilities that humans expect to undertake in these systems.\nParticipants in our study highlighted the need for a system capable of processing and analysing large volumes of data efficiently to help in crime detection and prevention. Additionally, the system should satisfy requirements for scalability, accuracy, justification, trustworthiness and adaptability to be adopted in this domain. Participants also emphasised the importance of having end users review the input data that might be challenging for AI to interpret, and validate the generated output to ensure the system's accuracy. To keep up with the evolving nature of the law enforcement domain, end users need to help the system adapt to the changes in criminal behaviour and government guidance, and technical experts need to regularly oversee and monitor the system. Furthermore, user-friendly human interaction with the system is essential for its adoption and some of the participants confirmed they would be happy to be in the loop and provide necessary feedback that the system can learn from. Finally, we argue that it is very unlikely that the system will ever achieve full automation due to the dynamic and complex nature of the law enforcement domain.",

    "summary": "Fairness-aware learning aims to mitigate discrimination against specific protected social groups (e.g., those categorized by gender, ethnicity, age) while minimizing predictive performance loss. Despite efforts to improve fairness in machine learning, prior studies have shown that many models remain unfair when measured against various fairness metrics. In this paper, we examine whether the way training and testing data are sampled affects the reliability of reported fairness metrics. Since training and test sets are often randomly sampled from the same population, bias present in the training data may still exist in the test data, potentially skewing fairness assessments. To address this, we propose FairMatch, a post-processing method that applies propensity score matching to evaluate and mitigate bias. FairMatch identifies control and treatment pairs with similar propensity scores in the test set and adjusts decision thresholds for different subgroups accordingly. For samples that cannot be matched, we perform probabilistic calibration using fairness-aware loss functions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can (a) precisely locate subsets of the test data where the model is unbiased, and (b) significantly reduce bias on the remaining data. Overall, propensity score matching offers a principled way to improve both fairness evaluation and mitigation, without sacrificing predictive performance.",

However, it has gone unexamined whether these evaluation methods have convergent validity, that is, whether their results align. Therefore, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of these methods across three existing datasets for LLM misgendering. We propose a method to transform each dataset to enable parallel probability- and generation-based evaluation. Then, by automatically evaluating a suite of 6 models from 3 families, we find that these methods can disagree with each other at the instance, dataset, and model levels, conflicting on 20.2% of evaluation instances. Finally, with a human evaluation of 2400 LLM generations, we show that misgendering behaviour is complex and goes far beyond pronouns, which automatic evaluations are not currently designed to capture, suggesting essential disagreement with human evaluations. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future evaluations of LLM misgendering. Our results are also more widely relevant, as they call into question broader methodological conventions in LLM evaluation, which often assume that different evaluation methods agree.",

    "summary": "Unresolved questions about how autonomous vehicles (AVs) should meet the informational needs of riders hinder real-world adoption. Complicating our ability to satisfy rider needs is that different people, goals, and driving contexts have different criteria for what constitutes interaction success. Unfortunately, most human-AV research and design today treats all people and situations uniformly. It is crucial to understand how an AV should communicate to meet rider needs, and how communications should change when the human-AV complex system changes. I argue that understanding the relationships between different aspects of the human-AV system can help us build improved and adaptable AV communications. I support this argument using three empirical studies. First, I identify optimal communication strategies that enhance driving performance, confidence, and trust for learning in extreme driving environments. Findings highlight the need for task-sensitive, modality-appropriate communications tuned to learner cognitive limits and goals. Next, I highlight the consequences of deploying faulty communication systems and demonstrate the need for context-sensitive communications. Third, I use machine learning (ML) to illuminate personal factors predicting trust in AVs, emphasizing the importance of tailoring designs to individual traits and concerns. Together, this dissertation supports the necessity of transparent, adaptable, and personalized AV systems that cater to individual needs, goals, and contextual demands. By considering the complex system within which human-AV interactions occur, we can deliver valuable insights for designers, researchers, and policymakers. This dissertation also provides a concrete domain to study theories of human-machine joint action and situational awareness, and can be used to guide future human-AI interaction research.

    "summary": "On-demand feeder bus services present an innovative solution to urban mobility challenges, yet their success depends on thorough assessment and strategic planning. Despite their potential, a comprehensive framework for evaluating feasibility and identifying suitable service areas remains underdeveloped. Simulation Framework for Feeder Location Evaluation (SimFLEX) uses spatial, demographic, and transport-specific data to run microsimulations and compute key performance indicators (KPIs), including service attractiveness, waiting time reduction, and added value. SimFLEX employs multiple replications to estimate demand and mode choices and integrates OpenTripPlanner (OTP) for public transport routing and ExMAS for calculating shared trip attributes and KPIs. For each demand scenario, we model the traveler learning process using the method of successive averages (MSA), stabilizing the system. After stabilization, we calculate KPIs for comparative and sensitivity analyzes. We applied SimFLEX to compare two remote urban areas in Krakow, Poland - Bronowice and Skotniki - the candidates for service launch. Our analysis revealed notable differences between analyzed areas: Skotniki exhibited higher service attractiveness (up to 30%) and added value (up to 7%), while Bronowice showed greater potential for reducing waiting times (by nearly 77%). To assess the reliability of our model output, we conducted a sensitivity analysis across a range of alternative-specific constants (ASC). The results consistently confirmed Skotniki as the superior candidate for service implementation. SimFLEX can be instrumental for policymakers to estimate new service performance in the considered area, publicly available and applicable to various use cases. It can integrate alternative models and approaches, making it a versatile tool for policymakers and urban planners to enhance urban mobility.",

This paper proposes RAGAT-Mind, a multi-granular modeling approach for Chinese rumor detection, built upon the MindSpore deep learning framework. The model integrates TextCNN for local semantic extraction, bidirectional GRU for sequential context learning, Multi-Head Self-Attention for global dependency focusing, and Bidirectional Graph Convolutional Networks (BiGCN) for structural representation of word co-occurrence graphs. Experiments on the Weibo1-Rumor dataset demonstrate that RAGAT-Mind achieves superior classification performance, attaining 99.2% accuracy and a macro-F1 score of 0.9919. The results validate the effectiveness of combining hierarchical linguistic features with graph-based semantic structures. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong generalization and interpretability, highlighting its practical value for real-world rumor detection applications.",

Three evaluations with different stakeholders were designed to disclose new perspectives on the strengths, weaknesses, design characteristics, and value requirements of this http URL. Evaluations concerned expert panels and involved patient federations, general practitioners, researchers, and the elderly themselves. Panels concerned interviews, a co-creation session, and feedback on a proof-of-concept implementation. Interview results were summarized in terms of this http URL's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The co-creation session ranked a variety of value requirements of this http URL with the Hundred Dollar Method. User evaluation comprised analysing proportions of (dis)agreement on statements targeting this http URL's design characteristics, and ranking desired social characteristics. Experts in the panel interviews acknowledged this http URL's potential to combat loneliness and extract patterns from elderly behaviour. The proof-of-concept evaluation complemented the design characteristics most appealing to the elderly to potentially achieve this: empathetic and varying interactions. Stakeholders also link the technology to the implementation context: it could help activate an individual's social network, but support should also be available to empower users. Yet, non-elderly and elderly experts also disclose challenges in properly understanding the application; non-elderly experts also highlight issues concerning privacy. In sum, incorporating all stakeholder perspectives in system development remains challenging. Still, our results benefit researchers, policy makers, and health professionals that aim to improve elderly care with technology.",

    "summary": "Although mobile devices benefit users in their daily lives in numerous ways, they also raise several privacy concerns. For instance, they can reveal sensitive information that can be inferred from location data. This location data is shared through service providers as well as mobile applications. Understanding how and with whom users share their location data -- as well as users' perception of the underlying privacy risks --, are important notions to grasp in order to design usable privacy-enhancing technologies. In this work, we perform a quantitative and qualitative analysis of smartphone users' awareness, perception and self-reported behavior towards location data-sharing through a survey of n=99 young adult participants (i.e., digital natives). We compare stated practices with actual behaviors to better understand their mental models, and survey participants' understanding of privacy risks before and after the inspection of location traces and the information that can be inferred therefrom.\nOur empirical results show that participants have risky privacy practices: about 54% of participants underestimate the number of mobile applications to which they have granted access to their data, and 33% forget or do not think of revoking access to their data. Also, by using a demonstrator to perform inferences from location data, we observe that slightly more than half of participants (57%) are surprised by the extent of potentially inferred information, and that 47% intend to reduce access to their data via permissions as a result of using the demonstrator. Last, a majority of participants have little knowledge of the tools to better protect themselves, but are nonetheless willing to follow suggestions to improve privacy (51%). Educating people, including digital natives, about privacy risks through transparency tools seems a promising approach.",

However, many DAOs face sustainability challenges linked to limited user participation, concentrated voting power, and technical design constraints. This paper addresses these issues by identifying research gaps in DAO evaluation and introducing a framework of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that capture governance efficiency, financial robustness, decentralisation, and community engagement. We apply the framework to a custom-built dataset of real-world DAOs constructed from on-chain data and analysed using non-parametric methods. The results reveal recurring governance patterns, including low participation rates and high proposer concentration, which may undermine long-term viability. The proposed KPIs offer a replicable, data-driven method for assessing DAO governance structures and identifying potential areas for improvement. These findings support a multidimensional approach to evaluating decentralised systems and provide practical tools for researchers and practitioners working to improve the resilience and effectiveness of DAO-based governance models.",

However, the criteria for meaningful human approval remain unclear, and there is limited analysis on the specific risks of autonomous AI R&D, how they arise, and how to mitigate them.

We create a dataset of 500 AI supercomputers from 2019 to 2025 and analyze key trends in performance, power needs, hardware cost, ownership, and global distribution. We find that the computational performance of AI supercomputers has doubled every nine months, while hardware acquisition cost and power needs both doubled every year. The leading system in March 2025, xAI's Colossus, used 200,000 AI chips, had a hardware cost of \\$7B, and required 300 MW of power, as much as 250,000 households. As AI supercomputers evolved from tools for science to industrial machines, companies rapidly expanded their share of total AI supercomputer performance, while the share of governments and academia diminished. Globally, the United States accounts for about 75% of total performance in our dataset, with China in second place at 15%. If the observed trends continue, the leading AI supercomputer in 2030 will achieve $2\\times10^{22}$ 16-bit FLOP/s, use two million AI chips, have a hardware cost of \\$200 billion, and require 9 GW of power.

Here, we delve into the dynamics of mental health discourse on various Reddit boards focused on depression. To this aim, we introduce a data-informed framework reconstructing online dynamics from 303k users interacting over two years. Through user-generated content, we identify 4 distinct clusters representing different psychological states. Our analysis unveils online posting effects: a user can transition to another psychological state after online exposure to peers' emotional/semantic content. As described by conditional Markov chains and different levels of social exposure, users' transitions reveal navigation through both positive and negative phases in a spiral rather than a linear progression. Interpreted in light of psychological literature, related particularly to the Patient Health Engagement (PHE) model, our findings can provide evidence that the type and layout of online social interactions have an impact on users' \"journeys\" when posting about depression.",

This study presents a post-hoc analysis of microtargeting practices within climate campaigns by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to examine Facebook advertisements. Our analysis focuses on two key aspects: demographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age group, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.55%. Furthermore, we instruct the LLMs to generate explanations for their classifications, providing transparent reasoning behind each decision. These explanations reveal the specific thematic elements used to engage different demographic segments, highlighting distinct strategies tailored to various audiences. Our findings show that young adults are primarily targeted through messages emphasizing activism and environmental consciousness, while women are engaged through themes related to caregiving roles and social advocacy. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting microtargeted messaging, we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis to identify potential biases in model predictions. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist, particularly in the classification of senior citizens and male audiences. By showcasing the efficacy of LLMs in dissecting and explaining targeted communication strategies and by highlighting fairness concerns, this study provides a valuable framework for future research aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in social media-driven climate campaigns.",

The study analyzes 81,823 publications from the journal PLOS ONE, covering the period from January 2018 to June 2023. It examines the authorship attributions within these publications to try and determine the prevalence of inappropriate authorship. It also investigates the demographic and professional profiles of affected authors, exploring trends and potential factors contributing to inaccuracies in authorship. Surprisingly, 9.14% of articles feature at least one author with inappropriate authorship, affecting over 14,000 individuals (2.56% of the sample). Inappropriate authorship is more concentrated in Asia, Africa, and specific European countries like Italy. Established researchers with significant publication records and those affiliated with companies or nonprofits show higher instances of potential monetary authorship. Our findings are based on contributions as declared by the authors, which implies a degree of trust in their transparency. However, this reliance on self-reporting may introduce biases or inaccuracies into the dataset. Further research could employ additional verification methods to enhance the reliability of the findings. These findings have significant implications for journal publishers, highlighting the necessity for robust control mechanisms to ensure the integrity of authorship attributions. Moreover, researchers must exercise discernment in determining when to acknowledge a contributor and when to include them in the author list.

    "summary": "Blockchain technology promises a decentralized, trustless, and interoperable infrastructure. However, widespread adoption remains hindered by issues such as limited scalability, high transaction costs, and the complexity of maintaining coherent verification logic across different blockchain layers. This paper introduces Verifiable Applications (vApps), a novel development framework designed to streamline the creation and deployment of verifiable blockchain computing applications. vApps offer a unified Rust-based Domain-Specific Language (DSL) within a comprehensive SDK, featuring modular abstractions for verification, proof generation, and inter-chain connectivity. This eases the developer's burden in securing diverse software components, allowing them to focus on application logic. The DSL also ensures that applications can automatically take advantage of specialized precompiles and hardware acceleration to achieve consistently high performance with minimal developer effort, as demonstrated by benchmark results for zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs). Experiments show that native Rust execution eliminates interpretation overhead, delivering up to an 832x cycle count improvement compared to EVM-based approaches. Precompiled circuits can accelerate the proof by more than 95%, while GPU acceleration increases throughput by up to 30x and recursion compresses the proof size by up to 230x, enabling succinct and efficient verification. The framework also supports seamless integration with the Web2 and Web3 systems, enabling developers to focus solely on their application logic. Through modular architecture, robust security guarantees, and composability, vApps pave the way toward a trust-minimized and verifiable Internet-scale application environment.",

This migration to the cloud is happening mainly for reasons of cost and scalability. Over the years, application developers have used different migration approaches, such as microservice frameworks, actors, and stateful dataflow systems.\nThe migration to the cloud has brought back data management challenges traditionally handled by database management systems. Those challenges include ensuring state consistency, maintaining durability, and managing the application lifecycle. At the same time, the shift to a distributed computing infrastructure introduced new issues, such as message delivery, task scheduling, containerization, and (auto)scaling.\nAlthough the data management community has made progress in developing analytical and transactional database systems, transactional cloud applications have received little attention in database research. This tutorial aims to highlight recent trends in the area and discusses open research challenges for the data management community.",

    "summary": "LSM-tree based key-value stores are widely adopted as the data storage backend in modern big data applications. The LSM-tree grows with data ingestion, by either adding levels with fixed level capacities (dubbed as vertical scheme) or increasing level capacities with fixed number of levels (dubbed as horizontal scheme). The vertical scheme leads the trend in recent system designs in RocksDB, LevelDB, and WiredTiger, whereas the horizontal scheme shows a decline in being adopted in the industry. The growth scheme profoundly impacts the LSM system performance in various aspects such as read, write and space costs. This paper attempts to give a new insight into a fundamental design question -- how to grow an LSM-tree to attain more desirable performance?\nOur analysis highlights the limitations of the vertical scheme in achieving an optimal read-write trade-off and the horizontal scheme in managing space cost effectively. Building on the analysis, we present a novel approach, Vertiorizon, which combines the strengths of both the vertical and horizontal schemes to achieve a superior balance between lookup, update, and space costs. Its adaptive design makes it highly compatible with a wide spectrum of workloads. Compared to the vertical scheme, Vertiorizon significantly improves the read-write performance trade-off. In contrast to the horizontal scheme, Vertiorizon greatly extends the trade-off range by a non-trivial generalization of Bentley and Saxe's theory, while substantially reducing space costs. When integrated with RocksDB, Vertiorizon demonstrates better write performance than the vertical scheme, while incurring about six times less additional space cost compared to the horizontal scheme.",

However, these models are predominantly validated using synthetic datasets focused on cardinality or latency estimations. This paper explores the application of these models to LinkedIn's complex real-world OLAP queries executed on Trino, addressing four primary research questions: (1) How do these models perform on real-world industrial data with limited information? (2) Can these models generalize to new tasks, such as CPU time prediction and classification? (3) What additional information available from the query plan could be utilized by these models to enhance their performance? (4) What are the theoretical performance limits of these models given the available data? To address these questions, we evaluate several models-including TLSTM, TCNN, QueryFormer, and XGBoost, against the industrial query workload at LinkedIn, and extend our analysis to CPU time regression and classification tasks. We also propose a multi-task learning approach to incorporate underutilized operator-level metrics that could enhance model understanding. Additionally, we empirically analyze the inherent upper bound that can be achieved from the models.",

    "summary": "The demand for high-fidelity test data is paramount in industrial settings where access to production data is largely restricted. Traditional data generation methods often fall short, struggling with low-fidelity and the ability to model complex data structures and semantic relationships that are critical for testing complex SQL code generation services like Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL). In this paper, we address the critical need for generating syntactically correct and semantically ``meaningful'' mock data for complex schema that includes columns with nested structures that we frequently encounter in Google SQL code generation workloads. We highlight the limitations of existing approaches used in production, particularly their inability to handle large and complex schema, as well as the lack of semantically coherent test data that lead to limited test coverage. We demonstrate that by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and incorporating strategic pre- and post-processing steps, we can generate realistic high-fidelity test data that adheres to complex structural constraints and maintains semantic integrity to the test targets (SQL queries/functions). This approach supports comprehensive testing of complex SQL queries involving joins, aggregations, and even deeply nested subqueries, ensuring robust evaluation of SQL code generation services, like NL2SQL and SQL Code Assistant services. Our results demonstrate the practical utility of an out-of-the-box LLM (\\textit{gemini}) based test data generation for industrial SQL code generation services where generating realistic test data is essential due to the frequent unavailability of production datasets.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates advanced storage models for evolving graphs, focusing on the efficient management of historical data and the optimization of global query performance. Evolving graphs, which represent dynamic relationships between entities over time, present unique challenges in preserving their complete history while supporting complex analytical queries. We first do a fast review of the current state of the art focusing mainly on distributed historical graph databases to provide the context of our proposals. We investigate the im- plementation of an enhanced vertex-centric storage model in MongoDB that prioritizes space efficiency by leveraging in-database query mechanisms to minimize redundant data and reduce storage costs. To ensure broad applicability, we employ datasets, some of which are generated with the LDBC SNB generator, appropriately post-processed to utilize both snapshot- and interval-based representations. Our experimental results both in centralized and distributed infrastructures, demonstrate significant improvements in query performance, particularly for resource-intensive global queries that traditionally suffer from inefficiencies in entity-centric frameworks. The proposed model achieves these gains by optimizing memory usage, reducing client involvement, and exploiting the computational capabilities of MongoDB. By addressing key bottlenecks in the storage and processing of evolving graphs, this study demonstrates a step toward a robust and scalable framework for managing dynamic graph data. This work contributes to the growing field of temporal graph analytics by enabling more efficient ex- ploration of historical data and facilitating real-time insights into the evolution of complex networks.",

Existing perturbation mechanisms typically require perturbing the original values to ensure acceptable privacy, which inevitably results in value distortion and utility deterioration. In this work, we propose an alternative approach -- instead of perturbing values, we apply randomization to indexes of values while ensuring rigorous LDP guarantees. Inspired by the deniability of randomized indexes, we present CRIAD for answering subset counting queries on set-value data. By integrating a multi-dummy, multi-sample, and multi-group strategy, CRIAD serves as a fully scalable solution that offers flexibility across various privacy requirements and domain sizes, and achieves more accurate query results than any existing methods. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experimental evaluations, we validate the effectiveness of CRIAD and demonstrate its superiority over traditional value-perturbation mechanisms.",

Federated Active Learning (FAL) addresses this by facilitating collaborative data selection and model training, while preserving the confidentiality of raw data samples. Yet, existing FAL methods fail to account for the heterogeneity of data distribution across clients and the associated fluctuations in global and local model parameters, adversely affecting model accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose CHASe (Client Heterogeneity-Aware Data Selection), specifically designed for FAL. CHASe focuses on identifying those unlabeled samples with high epistemic variations (EVs), which notably oscillate around the decision boundaries during training. To achieve both effectiveness and efficiency, \\model{} encompasses techniques for 1) tracking EVs by analyzing inference inconsistencies across training epochs, 2) calibrating decision boundaries of inaccurate models with a new alignment loss, and 3) enhancing data selection efficiency via a data freeze and awaken mechanism with subset sampling. Experiments show that CHASe surpasses various established baselines in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, validated across diverse datasets, model complexities, and heterogeneous federation settings.",

Therefore, software modernization is essential, particularly data migration between different database schemas. Established methodologies, like model transformation and ETL tools, facilitate this migration; they require deep knowledge of database languages and both the source and target schemas. This necessity renders data migration an error-prone and cognitively demanding task. Our objective is to alleviate developers' workloads during schema evolution through our DAMI-Framework. This framework incorporates a domain-specific language (DSL) and a parser to facilitate data migration between database schemas. DAMI-DSL simplifies schema mapping while the parser automates SQL script generation. We assess developer experience in data migration by conducting an empirical evaluation with 21 developers to assess their experiences using our DSL versus traditional SQL. The study allows us to measure their perceptions of the DSL properties and user experience. The participants praised DAMI-DSL for its readability and ease of use. The findings indicate that our DSL reduces data migration efforts compared to SQL scripts.",

Furthermore, HotStuff-1 incorporates an incentive-compatible leader rotation design that motivates leaders to propose transactions promptly. HotStuff-1 achieves a reduction of two network hops by speculatively sending clients early confirmations, after one phase of the protocol. Introducing speculation into streamlined protocols is challenging because, unlike stable-leader protocols, these protocols cannot stop the consensus and recover from failures. Thus, we identify prefix speculation dilemma in the context of streamlined protocols; HotStuff-1 is the first streamlined protocol to resolve it. HotStuff-1 embodies an additional mechanism, slotting, that thwarts delays caused by (1) rationally-incentivized leaders and (2) malicious leaders inclined to sabotage other's progress. The slotting mechanism allows leaders to dynamically drive as many decisions as allowed by network transmission delays before view timers expire, thus mitigating both threats.",

However, collecting such query corpus remains challenging in practice due to the high cost of manual annotation, which highlights the importance of automatic SQL generation. Despite recent advances, existing generation methods still face limitations in achieving both diversity and cost-effectiveness. Besides, many methods also treat all tables equally during generation, which overlooks schema complexity and leads to under-utilization of structurally rich tables. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-agent framework for high-quality and large-scale SQL generation, dubbed SQL-Factory. It decomposes the generation process into three collaborative teams: the Generation Team explores diverse query structures using large language models, the Expansion Team scales promising patterns via lightweight local models, and the Management Team adaptively schedules and evaluates generation based on schema coverage and real-time query quality. This modular framework ensures a balanced trade-off between diversity, scalability, and generation cost. We apply SQL-Factory to four widely used benchmarks and generate over 300,000 executable and broadly distributed SQL queries with less than $200 API cost. Our generated queries achieve higher diversity compared to other methods, and extensive experiments demonstrate that the generated queries significantly improve the model performance in various downstream tasks.",

We assume that the $n$ vertices of the graph are partitioned among $k$ players, who execute a distributed algorithm and communicate via message passing. An adaptive adversary may perform dynamic updates to the graph topology by inserting or removing edges between the nodes, and the algorithm needs to respond to these changes by adapting the output of the players, with the goal of maintaining an approximate maximum matching. The main performance metric in this setting is the algorithm's update time, which corresponds to the number of rounds required for updating the solution upon an adversarial change. For the standard setting of single-edge insertions and deletions, we obtain the following results:\nWe give a randomized Las Vegas algorithm with an expected update time of $O( \\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{\\beta k} )$ rounds that maintains a $\\frac{2}{3}$-approximate maximum matching that is also maximal, where $m$ is the number of edges of the graph. We also show that any algorithm has a worst case update time of $\\Omega( \\frac{n}{\\beta k^2\\log n} )$, assuming a link bandwidth of $O(\\beta\\log n)$ bits per round, if it maintains a matching that is maximal and does not have any 3-augmenting paths. For batch-dynamic updates, where the adversary may modify up to $\\ell\\ge 1$ edges at once, we prove the following: There is a randomized algorithm that succeeds with high probability in maintaining a $\\frac{2}{3}$-approximate maximum matching and has a worst case update time of $\\Omega( \\frac{\\ell\\log n}{\\sqrt{\\beta k}} )$ rounds. We show that $\\Omega( \\frac{\\ell}{\\beta k \\log n} )$ poses a lower bound for maintaining a maximal matching without 3-augmenting paths.",

LCL problems have been extensively studied in the LOCAL model, where nodes operate in synchronous rounds and have access only to local information. This has led to intriguing insights regarding the power of private randomness. E.g., for certain round complexity classes, derandomization does not incur an overhead (asymptotically).\nThis work considers a setting where the randomness is public. Recently, an LCL problem for which shared randomness can reduce the round complexity was discovered by Balliu et al. (2024). This result applies to inputs set obliviously of the shared randomness, which may not always be a plausible assumption.\nWe define a model where the inputs can be adversarially chosen, even based on the shared randomness, which we now call preset public coins. We study LCL problems in the preset public coins model, under assumptions regarding the computational power of the adversary that selects the input. We show connections to hardness in the class TFNP. Our results are:\n1. Assuming the existence of a hard-on-average problem in TFNP (which follows from fairly benign cryptographic assumptions), we show an LCL problem that, in the preset public coins model, demonstrates a gap in the round complexity between polynomial-time adversaries and unbounded ones.\n2. If there exists an LCL problem for which the error probability is significantly higher when facing unbounded adversaries, then a hard-on-average problem in TFNP/poly must exist.",

    "summary": "Compared to replication-based storage systems, erasure-coded storage incurs significantly higher overhead during data updates. To address this issue, various parity logging methods have been pro- posed. Nevertheless, due to the long update path and substantial amount of random I/O involved in erasure code update processes, the resulting long latency and low throughput often fail to meet the requirements of high performance applications. To this end, we propose a two-stage data update method called TSUE. TSUE divides the update process into a synchronous stage that records updates in a data log, and an asynchronous stage that recycles the log in real-time. TSUE effectively reduces update latency by transforming random I/O into sequential I/O, and it significantly reduces recycle overhead by utilizing a three-layer log and the spatio-temporal locality of access patterns. In SSDs cluster, TSUE significantly im- proves update performance, achieving improvements of 7.6X under Ali-Cloud trace, 5X under Ten-Cloud trace, while it also extends the SSD's lifespan by up to 13X through reducing the frequencies of reads/writes and of erase operations.",

    "summary": "Training large language models (LLMs) requires massive computational resources, often necessitating the aggregation of geographically distributed data centers (\\ie, cross-region training). However, the high communication latency in wide-area networks severely degrades the efficiency of traditional distributed training. While methods like DiLoCo reduce communication frequency, they suffer from blocking synchronization. Streaming DiLoCo alleviates this issue via communication-computation overlapping but introduces update staleness and model inconsistency due to delayed global updates and partial synchronization. These factors impair convergence, especially when aggressive overlap is needed to mask high latency. We propose CoCoDC, a novel distributed training framework with communication-computation overlapping and delay compensation, to explicitly tackle these challenges. Within the CoCoDC framework, we specifically develop a novel Delay Compensation strategy based on Taylor expansion to effectively mitigate the staleness and an Adaptive Transmission strategy that dynamically schedules model fragment synchronization to optimize bandwidth usage and accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments highlight the superior performance of CoCoDC over both DiLoCo and Streaming DiLoCo regarding final accuracy and training speed. Specifically, CoCoDC reduces the training steps needed to reach a comparable perplexity by up to 21.0% compared to Streaming DiLoCo. Our work provides an effective solution for scalable and efficient cross-region LLM training.",

    "summary": "Active learning (AL) reduces human annotation costs for machine learning systems by strategically selecting the most informative unlabeled data for annotation, but performing it individually may still be insufficient due to restricted data diversity and annotation budget. Federated Active Learning (FAL) addresses this by facilitating collaborative data selection and model training, while preserving the confidentiality of raw data samples. Yet, existing FAL methods fail to account for the heterogeneity of data distribution across clients and the associated fluctuations in global and local model parameters, adversely affecting model accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose CHASe (Client Heterogeneity-Aware Data Selection), specifically designed for FAL. CHASe focuses on identifying those unlabeled samples with high epistemic variations (EVs), which notably oscillate around the decision boundaries during training. To achieve both effectiveness and efficiency, \\model{} encompasses techniques for 1) tracking EVs by analyzing inference inconsistencies across training epochs, 2) calibrating decision boundaries of inaccurate models with a new alignment loss, and 3) enhancing data selection efficiency via a data freeze and awaken mechanism with subset sampling. Experiments show that CHASe surpasses various established baselines in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, validated across diverse datasets, model complexities, and heterogeneous federation settings.",

    "summary": "Gossip Learning (GL) is a decentralized learning paradigm where users iteratively exchange and aggregate models with a small set of neighboring peers. Recent GL approaches rely on dynamic communication graphs built and maintained using Random Peer Sampling (RPS) protocols. Thanks to graph dynamics, GL can achieve fast convergence even over extremely sparse topologies. However, the robustness of GL over dy- namic graphs to Byzantine (model poisoning) attacks remains unaddressed especially when Byzantine nodes attack the RPS protocol to scale up model poisoning. We address this issue by introducing GRANITE, a framework for robust learning over sparse, dynamic graphs in the presence of a fraction of Byzantine nodes. GRANITE relies on two key components (i) a History-aware Byzantine-resilient Peer Sampling protocol (HaPS), which tracks previously encountered identifiers to reduce adversarial influence over time, and (ii) an Adaptive Probabilistic Threshold (APT), which leverages an estimate of Byzantine presence to set aggregation thresholds with formal guarantees. Empirical results confirm that GRANITE maintains convergence with up to 30% Byzantine nodes, improves learning speed via adaptive filtering of poisoned models and obtains these results in up to 9 times sparser graphs than dictated by current theory.",

In the proposed method, each local model is represented as the Hadamard product of global real-valued parameters and a personalized binary mask for pruning. The local model is learned by updating and fusing the personalized binary masks while the real-valued parameters are fixed among different agents. To further reduce the complexity of hardware implementation, we incorporate a group sparse regularization term in the loss function, enabling the learned local model to achieve structured sparsity. Then, a binary mask aggregation algorithm is designed by introducing an intermediate aggregation tensor and adding a personalized fine-tuning step in each iteration, which constrains model updates towards the local data distribution. The proposed method effectively leverages the relativity among agents while meeting personalized requirements in heterogeneous node conditions. We also provide a theoretical proof for the DSLTH, establishing it as the foundation of the proposed method. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of the DSLTH and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

Recent advancements enable what we call tethering a blockchain to a primary blockchain, securing the tethered chain by nodes that post primary-chain tokens as collateral. The collateral ensures nodes behave as intended, until they withdraw it. Unlike a Proof of Stake blockchain which uses its own token as collateral, using primary-chain tokens shields the tethered chain from the volatility of its own token.\nState-of-the-art tethered blockchains either rely on centralization, or make extreme assumptions: that all communication is synchronous, that operators remain correct even post-withdrawal, or that withdrawals can be indefinitely delayed by tethered-chain failures.\nWe prove that with partial synchrony, there is no solution to the problem. However, under the standard assumptions that communication with the primary chain is synchronous and communication among the tethered chain nodes is partially synchronous, there is a solution. We present a tethered-chain protocol called Aegis. Aegis uses references from its blocks to primary blocks to define committees, checkpoints on the primary chain to perpetuate decisions, and resets to establish new committees when previous ones become obsolete. It ensures safety at all times and rapid progress when latency among Aegis nodes is low.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for empowering large language model (LLM) applications. Compared with the supervised training process of LLMs, the RLHF training process is much more sophisticated, requiring a diverse range of computation workloads with intricate dependencies between multiple LLM instances. Therefore, simply adopting the fixed parallelization strategies from supervised training for LLMs can be insufficient for RLHF and result in low training efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel technique named parameter ReaLlocation, which dynamically adapts the parallelization strategies for different workloads during training by redistributing LLM parameters across the training cluster. Building upon this idea, we introduce ReaL, a pioneering system for efficient RLHF training. ReaL introduces the concept of an execution plan, which defines a fine-grained resource allocation and parallelization strategy particularly designed for RLHF training. Based on this concept, ReaL employs a tailored search algorithm with a lightweight run-time estimator to automatically discover an efficient execution plan for an instance of RLHF experiment. Subsequently, the runtime engine deploys the selected plan by effectively parallelizing computations and redistributing parameters. We evaluate ReaL on the LLaMA models with up to 70 billion parameters and 128 GPUs. The experimental results demonstrate that ReaL achieves speedups of up to $3.58\\times$ compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, the execution plans generated by ReaL exhibit an average of $81\\%$ performance improvement over heuristic approaches based on Megatron-LM in the long-context scenario.

In this paper, we investigate this time advantage mechanism, focusing specifically on arbitrage opportunities on Automated Market Makers (AMMs), one of the largest sources of MEV today.

The operating system (OS) plays a vital role in identifying tasks suitable for offloading and coordinating between the CPU and FPGA for seamless task execution. The OS leverages preemption to manage CPU efficiently and balance CPU time; however, preempting tasks running on FPGAs without context loss remains challenging. Despite growing reliance on FPGAs, vendors have yet to deliver a solution that fully preserves and restores task context.\nThis paper presents EPOCH, the first out-of-the-box framework to seamlessly preserve the state of tasks running on multi-tenant cloud FPGAs. EPOCH enables interrupting a tenant's execution at any arbitrary clock cycle, capturing its state, and saving this 'state snapshot' in off-chip memory with fine-grain granularity. Subsequently, when task resumption is required, EPOCH can resume execution from the saved 'state snapshot', eliminating the need to restart the task from scratch. EPOCH automates intricate processes, shields users from complexities, and synchronizes all underlying logic in a common clock domain, mitigating timing violations and ensuring seamless handling of interruptions.\nEPOCH proficiently captures the state of fundamental FPGA elements, such as look-up tables, flip-flops, block--RAMs, and digital signal processing units.

Unfortunately, existing scheduling techniques used \\emph{incorrect} metrics and had \\emph{unrealistic} assumptions for fair scheduling of multi-tenant FPGAs where each tenant is aimed to share approximately the same number of resources both spatially and temporally.\nThis paper introduces an enhanced fair scheduling algorithm for multi-tenant FPGA use, addressing previous metric and assumption issues, with three specific improvements claimed First, our method ensures spatiotemporal fairness by considering both spatial and temporal aspects, addressing the limitation of prior work that assumed uniform task latency. Second, we incorporate energy considerations into fairness by adjusting scheduling intervals and accounting for energy overhead, thereby balancing energy efficiency with fairness. Third, we acknowledge overlooked aspects of FPGA multi-tenancy, including heterogeneous regions and the constraints on dynamically merging/splitting partially reconfigurable regions. We develop and evaluate our improved fair scheduling algorithm with these three enhancements.

Experimental validation is performed on a synthetic dataset that is designed to measure the effectiveness of the communication network.

The results demonstrate that the approach, which includes inter-patch communication for images divided into $16\\times16$ non-overlapping subimages, achieves a $2-3\\,\\%$ higher intersection over union (IoU) score compared to the same network without inter-patch communication. The performance of the network which includes communication is equivalent to that of a baseline U-Net trained on the full image, showing that our model provides an effective solution for segmenting ultra-high-resolution images while preserving spatial context.

    "summary": "Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) applications face performance challenges due to their high computational demands and need for low-latency responses. Traditional approaches like on-device storage or reactive data fetching from the cloud often result in limited AR experiences or unacceptable lag. Edge caching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising solution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific features such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location. This paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing AR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SPAARC, a Spatial Proximity and Association-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches. SPAARC intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their association with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It also considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to efficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE).\nThrough extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads, we demonstrate that SPAARC significantly improves cache hit rates compared to standard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3% to 40% while reducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we present an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SPAARC parameters to achieve optimal performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SPAARC to substantially enhance the user experience in MAR applications by ensuring the timely availability of virtual objects.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence have provided more alternatives for the implementation of repetitive or monotonous tasks. However, the development of AI tools has not been straightforward, and use case exploration and workflow integration are still ongoing challenges. In this work, we present a detailed qualitative analysis of the performance and user experience of popular commercial AI chatbots when used for document classification with limited data. We report the results for a real-world example of metadata augmentation in academic libraries environment. We compare the results of AI chatbots with other machine learning and natural language processing methods such as XGBoost and BERT-based fine tuning, and share insights from our experience. We found that AI chatbots perform similarly among them while outperforming the machine learning methods we tested, showing their advantage when the method relies on local data for training. We also found that while working with AI chatbots is easier than with code, getting useful results from them still represents a challenge for the user. Furthermore, we encountered alarming conceptual errors in the output of some chatbots, such as not being able to count the number of lines of our inputs and explaining the mistake as ``human error''. Although this is not complete evidence that AI chatbots can be effectively used for metadata classification, we believe that the information provided in this work can be useful to librarians and data curators in developing pathways for the integration and use of AI tools for data curation or metadata augmentation tasks.",

The study analyzes 81,823 publications from the journal PLOS ONE, covering the period from January 2018 to June 2023. It examines the authorship attributions within these publications to try and determine the prevalence of inappropriate authorship. It also investigates the demographic and professional profiles of affected authors, exploring trends and potential factors contributing to inaccuracies in authorship. Surprisingly, 9.14% of articles feature at least one author with inappropriate authorship, affecting over 14,000 individuals (2.56% of the sample). Inappropriate authorship is more concentrated in Asia, Africa, and specific European countries like Italy. Established researchers with significant publication records and those affiliated with companies or nonprofits show higher instances of potential monetary authorship. Our findings are based on contributions as declared by the authors, which implies a degree of trust in their transparency. However, this reliance on self-reporting may introduce biases or inaccuracies into the dataset. Further research could employ additional verification methods to enhance the reliability of the findings. These findings have significant implications for journal publishers, highlighting the necessity for robust control mechanisms to ensure the integrity of authorship attributions. Moreover, researchers must exercise discernment in determining when to acknowledge a contributor and when to include them in the author list. Addressing these issues is crucial for maintaining the credibility and fairness of academic publications.",

While considerable attention has been given to the numerical factorization process, less focus has been placed on parallelizing the approximate minimum degree algorithm itself. In this paper, we explore different parallelization strategies, and introduce a novel parallel framework that leverages multiple elimination on distance-2 independent sets. Our evaluation shows that parallelism within individual elimination steps is limited due to low computational workload and significant memory contention. In contrast, our proposed framework overcomes these challenges by parallelizing the work across elimination steps. To the best of our knowledge, our implementation is the first scalable shared memory implementation of the approximate minimum degree algorithm. Experimental results show that we achieve up to an 8.30x speedup using 64 threads over the state-of-the-art sequential implementation in SuiteSparse.",

We establish the key properties of Forman curvature in the context of multilayer networks and demonstrate its utility for identifying vertices that hold central positions within these networks.

For binary alphabets, we characterize the class of morphisms that preserve the number of BWT-runs up to a bounded additive increase, by showing that it coincides with the known class of primitivity-preserving morphisms, which are those that map primitive words to primitive words. We further prove that deciding whether a given binary morphism has bounded BWT-run sensitivity is possible in polynomial time with respect to the total length of the images of the two letters.

When query costs are non-uniform, we provide a $5.83$-approximation algorithm for the $\\delta$-minimum value and a $7.47$-approximation for the $\\delta$-minimizer. All our algorithms rely on non-adaptive policies (that perform a fixed sequence of queries), so we also upper bound the corresponding ''adaptivity'' gaps.

We study a relaxation of the above problems. Specifically, we allow all possible subsets of items to be feasible solutions. However, only those items for which we pick at least one or all of its neighbor (out-neighbor for directed graph) contribute to profit whereas every item picked contribute to the weight; we call the corresponding problems \\sor and \\sand. We show that both \\sor and \\sand are strongly \\NPC even on undirected graphs. Regarding parameterized complexity, we show both \\sor and \\hor are \\WTH parameterized by the size $s$ of the knapsack size. Interestingly, both \\sand and \\hand are \\WOH parameterized by knapsack size, $s$ plus profit demand, $d$ and also parameterized by solution size, $b$.

Given a source vertex s, Dijkstra's algorithm computes the shortest path lengths from s to all other vertices in O(m + n log n) time. This bound is known to be worst-case optimal via a reduction to sorting. Theoretical computer science has developed numerous fine-grained frameworks for analyzing algorithmic performance beyond standard worst-case analysis, such as instance optimality and output sensitivity. Haeupler et al. [FOCS '24] consider the notion of universal optimality, a refined complexity measure that accounts for both the graph topology and the edge weights. For a fixed graph topology, the universal running time of a weighted graph algorithm is defined as its worst-case running time over all possible edge weightings of G. An algorithm is universally optimal if no other algorithm achieves a better asymptotic universal running time on any particular graph topology. They show that Dijkstra's algorithm can be made universally optimal by replacing the heap with a custom data structure.\nWe revisit their result. We introduce a simple heap property called timestamp optimality, where the cost of popping an element x is logarithmic in the number of elements inserted between pushing and popping x. We show that timestamp optimal heaps are not only easier to define but also easier to implement. Using these timestamps, we provide a significantly simpler proof that Dijkstra's algorithm, with the right kind of heap, is universally optimal.",

Both of these works measure the online competitiveness against the offline LP relaxation introduced by [JL14]. This LP has also played an important role in other settings since it is a natural choice for two-choices online algorithms.\nIn this paper, we propose an upper bound of $0.663$ and a lower bound of $0.662$ for edge-weighted online stochastic matching under Jaillet-Lu LP. First, we propose a hard instance and prove that the optimal online algorithm for this instance only has a competitive ratio $<0.663$. Then, we show that a near-optimal algorithm for this instance can be generalized to work on all instances and achieve a competitive ratio $>0.662$.

However, sketching algorithms in the graph semi-streaming model use $O(V polylog(V))$ space for a $V$-vertex graph, and the fact that implementations of these algorithms are not used in the academic literature or in industrial applications may be because this space requirement is too large for RAM on today's hardware.\nIn this paper we introduce the external semi-streaming model, which addresses the aspects of the semi-streaming model that limit its practical impact. In this model, the input is in the form of a stream and $O(V polylog(V))$ space is available, but most of that space is accessible only via block I/O operations as in the external memory model. The goal in the external semi-streaming model is to simultaneously achieve small space and low I/O cost.\nWe present a general transformation from any vertex-based sketch algorithm to one which has a low sketching cost in the new model. We prove that this automatic transformation is tight or nearly (up to a $O(\\log(V))$ factor) tight via an I/O lower bound for the task of sketching the input stream.\nUsing this transformation and other techniques, we present external semi-streaming algorithms for connectivity, bipartiteness testing, $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximating MST weight, testing k-edge connectivity, $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximating the minimum cut of a graph, computing $\\epsilon$-cut sparsifiers, and approximating the density of the densest subgraph. These algorithms all use $O(V poly(\\log(V), \\epsilon^{-1},k)$ space.

We demonstrate how to achieve the best of both worlds with a \\emph{linear time multilevel algorithm}. Multilevel algorithms construct a hierarchy of increasingly smaller graphs by repeatedly contracting clusters of nodes. Our approach preserves their distinct advantage, allowing refinement of the partition over multiple levels with increasing detail. At the same time, we use \\emph{edge sparsification} to guarantee geometric size reduction between the levels and thus linear running time.\nWe provide a proof of the linear running time as well as additional insights into the behavior of multilevel algorithms, showing that graphs with low modularity are most likely to trigger worst-case running time. We evaluate multiple approaches for edge sparsification and integrate our algorithm into the state-of-the-art multilevel partitioner KaMinPar, maintaining its excellent parallel scalability. As demonstrated in detailed experiments, this results in a $1.49\\times$ average speedup (up to $4\\times$ for some instances) with only 1\\% loss in solution quality.

    "summary": "In this paper, we present a general framework for efficiently computing diverse solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. Given a problem instance, the goal is to find $k$ solutions that maximize a specified diversity measure; the sum of pairwise Hamming distances or the size of the union of the $k$ solutions. Our framework applies to problems satisfying two structural properties: (i) All solutions are of equal size and (ii) the family of all solutions can be represented by a surjection from the family of ideals of some finite poset. Under these conditions, we show that the problem of computing $k$ diverse solutions can be reduced to the minimum cost flow problem and the maximum $s$-$t$ flow problem. As applications, we demonstrate that both the unweighted minimum $s$-$t$ cut problem and the stable matching problem satisfy the requirements of our framework. By utilizing the recent advances in network flows algorithms, we improve the previously known time complexities of the diverse problems, which were based on submodular function minimization.",

Given a graph $G$ and a parameter $k$, one has to decide if there is a set $S$ of at most $k$ vertices such that $G-S$ is acyclic. Assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis, it is known that FVS cannot be solved in time $2^{o(k)}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$ in general graphs. To overcome this, many recent results considered FVS restricted to particular intersection graph classes and provided such $2^{o(k)}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$ algorithms.\nIn this paper we provide generic conditions on a graph class for the existence of an algorithm solving FVS in subexponential FPT time, i.e. time $2^{k^\\varepsilon} \\mathop{\\rm poly}(n)$, for some $\\varepsilon<1$, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices of the instance and $k$ the parameter. On the one hand this result unifies algorithms that have been proposed over the years for several graph classes such as planar graphs, map graphs, unit-disk graphs, pseudo-disk graphs, and string graphs of bounded edge-degree. On the other hand it extends the tractability horizon of FVS to new classes that are not amenable to previously used techniques, in particular intersection graphs of ``thin'' objects like segment graphs or more generally $s$-string graphs.",

The goal is to minimize the sum of distances between consecutive points in the array. This problem was introduced by Abrahamsen, Bercea, Beretta, Klausen, and Kozma [ESA'24] as a generalization of the online sorting problem, which was introduced by Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta, and Kleist [SODA'23] as a tool in their study of online geometric packing problems.\nOnline metric TSP has been studied for a range of fixed metric spaces. For 1-dimensional Euclidean space, the problem is equivalent to online sorting, where an optimal competitive ratio of $\\Theta(\\sqrt n)$ is known. For $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, the best-known upper bound is $O(2^{d} \\sqrt{dn\\log n})$, leaving a gap to the $\\Omega(\\sqrt n)$ lower bound. Finally, for the uniform metric, where all distances are 0 or 1, the optimal competitive ratio is known to be $\\Theta(\\log n)$.\nWe study the problem for a general metric space, presenting an algorithm with competitive ratio $O(\\sqrt n)$. In particular, we close the gap for $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, completely removing the dependence on dimension.

Our main results are a complete characterization of the feasible cases, and a recognition algorithm that runs in $O(n)$ time for graphical degree sequences (realized as simple temporal graphs) and in $O(n+m)$ time for multigraphical degree sequences (realized as non-simple temporal graphs, where the number of time labels on an edge corresponds to the multiplicity of the edge in the multigraph). In fact, these algorithms can be made constructive at essentially no cost.

    "summary": "Fitting distances to tree metrics and ultrametrics are two widely used methods in hierarchical clustering, primarily explored within the context of numerical taxonomy. Given a positive distance function $D:\\binom{V}{2}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, the goal is to find a tree (or ultrametric) $T$ including all elements of set $V$ such that the difference between the distances among vertices in $T$ and those specified by $D$ is minimized. In this paper, we initiate the study of ultrametric and tree metric fitting problems in the semi-streaming model, where the distances between pairs of elements from $V$ (with $|V|=n$), defined by the function $D$, can arrive in an arbitrary order. We study these problems under various distance norms:\nFor the $\\ell_0$ objective, we provide a single-pass polynomial-time $\\tilde{O}(n)$-space $O(1)$ approximation algorithm for ultrametrics and prove that no single-pass exact algorithm exists, even with exponential time.\nNext, we show that the algorithm for $\\ell_0$ implies an $O(\\Delta/\\delta)$ approximation for the $\\ell_1$ objective, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum and $\\delta$ is the minimum absolute difference between distances in the input. This bound matches the best-known approximation for the RAM model using a combinatorial algorithm when $\\Delta/\\delta=O(n)$.\nFor the $\\ell_\\infty$ objective, we provide a complete characterization of the ultrametric fitting problem. We present a single-pass polynomial-time $\\tilde{O}(n)$-space 2-approximation algorithm and show that no better than 2-approximation is possible, even with exponential time. We also show that, with an additional pass, it is possible to achieve a polynomial-time exact algorithm for ultrametrics.\nFinally, we extend the results for all these objectives to tree metrics by using only one additional pass through the stream and without asymptotically increasing the approximation factor.",

While considerable attention has been given to the numerical factorization process, less focus has been placed on parallelizing the approximate minimum degree algorithm itself. In this paper, we explore different parallelization strategies, and introduce a novel parallel framework that leverages multiple elimination on distance-2 independent sets. Our evaluation shows that parallelism within individual elimination steps is limited due to low computational workload and significant memory contention. In contrast, our proposed framework overcomes these challenges by parallelizing the work across elimination steps. To the best of our knowledge, our implementation is the first scalable shared memory implementation of the approximate minimum degree algorithm. Experimental results show that we achieve up to an 8.30x speedup using 64 threads over the state-of-the-art sequential implementation in SuiteSparse.",

We assume that the $n$ vertices of the graph are partitioned among $k$ players, who execute a distributed algorithm and communicate via message passing. An adaptive adversary may perform dynamic updates to the graph topology by inserting or removing edges between the nodes, and the algorithm needs to respond to these changes by adapting the output of the players, with the goal of maintaining an approximate maximum matching. The main performance metric in this setting is the algorithm's update time, which corresponds to the number of rounds required for updating the solution upon an adversarial change. For the standard setting of single-edge insertions and deletions, we obtain the following results:\nWe give a randomized Las Vegas algorithm with an expected update time of $O( \\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{\\beta k} )$ rounds that maintains a $\\frac{2}{3}$-approximate maximum matching that is also maximal, where $m$ is the number of edges of the graph. We also show that any algorithm has a worst case update time of $\\Omega( \\frac{n}{\\beta k^2\\log n} )$, assuming a link bandwidth of $O(\\beta\\log n)$ bits per round, if it maintains a matching that is maximal and does not have any 3-augmenting paths. For batch-dynamic updates, where the adversary may modify up to $\\ell\\ge 1$ edges at once, we prove the following: There is a randomized algorithm that succeeds with high probability in maintaining a $\\frac{2}{3}$-approximate maximum matching and has a worst case update time of $\\Omega( \\frac{\\ell\\log n}{\\sqrt{\\beta k}} )$ rounds.

For binary alphabets, we characterize the class of morphisms that preserve the number of BWT-runs up to a bounded additive increase, by showing that it coincides with the known class of primitivity-preserving morphisms, which are those that map primitive words to primitive words. We further prove that deciding whether a given binary morphism has bounded BWT-run sensitivity is possible in polynomial time with respect to the total length of the images of the two letters. Additionally, we explore new structural and combinatorial properties of synchronizing and recognizable morphisms.

Almost-commutative languages generalize both commutative languages and finite languages, and they are the analogue for trees of the ZG languages enjoying constant-time dynamic membership over words. Our main technical contribution is to show that this class is conditionally optimal when we assume that the alphabet features a neutral letter, i.e., a letter that has no effect on membership to the language.

Statistical similarity is a basic measure of similarity between distributions, with several natural interpretations, and captures the Bayes error in prediction and hypothesis testing problems.

We study differentially private algorithms, called privacy wrappers, that, given black-box access to a real-valued function $f$ and a sensitive dataset $x$, output an accurate approximation to $f(x)$. The dataset $x$ is modeled as a finite subset of a possibly infinite set $U$, in which each entry represents data of one individual. A privacy wrapper calls $f$ on the dataset $x$ and on some subsets of $x$ and returns either an approximation to $f(x)$ or a nonresponse symbol $\\perp$. The wrapper may also use additional information (that is, parameters) provided by the analyst, but differential privacy is required for all values of these parameters. Correct setting of these parameters will ensure better accuracy of the wrapper. The bottleneck in the running time of our wrappers is the number of calls to $f$, which we refer to as queries. Our goal is to design wrappers with high accuracy and low query complexity. We introduce a novel setting, the automated sensitivity detection setting, where the analyst supplies the black-box function $f$ and the intended (finite) range of $f$. In the previously considered setting, the claimed sensitivity bound setting, the analyst supplies additional parameters that describe the sensitivity of $f$. We design privacy wrappers for both settings and show that our wrappers are nearly optimal in terms of accuracy, locality (i.e., the depth of the local neighborhood of the dataset $x$ they explore), and query complexity. In the claimed sensitivity bound setting, we provide the first accuracy guarantees that have no dependence on the size of the universe $U$.",

It is setting-dependent whether or not a nearly matching upper bound is attainable. We study the conditions under which the two-point testing lower bound can be attained for univariate mean estimation; both in the setting of location estimation (where the distribution is known up to translation) and adaptive location estimation (unknown distribution). Roughly, we will say an estimate nearly attains the two-point testing lower bound if it incurs error that is at most polylogarithmically larger than the Hellinger modulus of continuity for $\\tilde{\\Omega}(n)$ samples.\nAdaptive location estimation is particularly interesting as some distributions admit much better guarantees than sub-Gaussian rates (e.g. $\\operatorname{Unif}(\\mu-1,\\mu+1)$ permits error $\\Theta(\\frac{1}{n})$, while the sub-Gaussian rate is $\\Theta(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}})$), yet it is not obvious whether these rates may be adaptively attained by one unified approach. Our main result designs an algorithm that nearly attains the two-point testing rate for mixtures of symmetric, log-concave distributions with a common mean. Moreover, this algorithm runs in near-linear time and is parameter-free. In contrast, we show the two-point testing rate is not nearly attainable even for symmetric, unimodal distributions.\nWe complement this with results for location estimation, showing the two-point testing rate is nearly attainable for unimodal distributions, but unattainable for symmetric distributions.",

The approach carefully combines, on one hand, a classical method based on ``large-step'' random walks for reduced mixing time and, on the other hand, quantum algorithmic techniques, including quantum graph sparsification and a sampling-without-replacement variant of Hamoudi's multiple-state preparation. We also establish a matching lower bound, proving the optimality of our algorithm up to polylogarithmic factors. These results highlight the potential of quantum computing in accelerating fundamental graph sampling problems.",

    "summary": "Molecular Communication (MC) channels inherently possess significant memory and nonlinear dynamics due to diffusion and receptor kinetics, often posing challenges for reliable data transmission. This work reconceptualizes these intrinsic properties as computational resources by framing a canonical point-to-point MC channel, consisting of ligand diffusion and reversible ligand-receptor binding at a spherical receiver, as a physical reservoir computer (PRC). We utilize the time-varying fraction of bound receptors as the reservoir's internal state, employing time-multiplexing to generate high-dimensional virtual nodes without explicit recurrence. Only a linear readout layer is trained via ridge regression. Through deterministic mean-field modeling and particle-based spatial stochastic simulations, we demonstrate the MC system's capability for complex temporal processing by successfully performing next-step prediction on standard chaotic time-series benchmarks (Mackey-Glass and NARMA10). Performance, quantified by Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on key system parameters (receptor kinetic rates, diffusion coefficient, transmitter-receiver distance), revealing optimal operational regimes. These findings validate the potential of using MC channel as effective and low-complexity computational substrate.",

    "summary": "The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a foundational stride towards deciphering the fundamentals of complex biological systems. Inferring a possible regulatory link between two genes can be formulated as a link prediction problem. Inference of GRNs via gene coexpression profiling data may not always reflect true biological interactions, as its susceptibility to noise and misrepresenting true biological regulatory relationships. Most GRN inference methods face several challenges in the network reconstruction phase. Therefore, it is important to encode gene expression values, leverege the prior knowledge gained from the available inferred network structures and positional informations of the input network nodes towards inferring a better and more confident GRN network reconstruction. In this paper, we explore the integration of multiple inferred networks to enhance the inference of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). Primarily, we employ autoencoder embeddings to capture gene expression patterns directly from raw data, preserving intricate biological signals. Then, we embed the prior knowledge from GRN structures transforming them into a text-like representation using random walks, which are then encoded with a masked language model, BERT, to generate global embeddings for each gene across all networks. Additionally, we embed the positional encodings of the input gene networks to better identify the position of each unique gene within the graph. These embeddings are integrated into graph transformer-based model, termed GT-GRN, for GRN inference. The GT-GRN model effectively utilizes the topological structure of the ground truth network while incorporating the enriched encoded information. Experimental results demonstrate that GT-GRN significantly outperforms existing GRN inference methods, achieving superior accuracy and highlighting the robustness of our approach.",

Designing suitable feature spaces for neural network-based motion planers that encapsulate all kinds of road scenarios is still an open research challenge. This paper tackles this learning-based generalization challenge and shows how graph representations of road networks can be leveraged by using multidimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in order to obtain such feature spaces.

In this paper, we present WISE, a novel computing architecture for wireless edge networks designed to overcome energy constraints in deep learning inference. WISE achieves this goal through two key innovations: disaggregated model access via wireless broadcasting and in-physics computation of general complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at radio frequency. Using a software-defined radio platform with wirelessly broadcast model weights over the air, we demonstrate that WISE achieves 95.7% image classification accuracy with ultra-low operation power of 6.0 fJ/MAC per client, corresponding to a computation efficiency of 165.8 TOPS/W.

However, for WNoC to fulfill its potential, it is essential to establish multiple high-speed wireless links across chips. Unfortunately, the compact and enclosed nature of computing packages introduces significant challenges in the form of Co-Channel Interference and Inter-Symbol Interference, which not only hinder the deployment of multiple spatial channels but also severely restrict the symbol rate of each individual channel. In this paper, we posit that Time Reversal (TR) could be effective in addressing both impairments in this static scenario thanks to its spatiotemporal focusing capabilities even in the near field. Through comprehensive full-wave simulations and bit error rate analysis in multiple scenarios and at multiple frequency bands, we provide evidence that TR can increase the symbol rate by an order of magnitude, enabling the deployment of multiple concurrent links and achieving aggregate speeds exceeding 100 Gb/s. Finally, we evaluate the impact of reducing the sampling rate of the TR filter on the achievable speeds, paving the way to practical TR-based wireless communications at the chip scale.",

Traditional approaches like on-device storage or reactive data fetching from the cloud often result in limited AR experiences or unacceptable lag. Edge caching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising solution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific features such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location. This paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing AR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SPAARC, a Spatial Proximity and Association-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches. SPAARC intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their association with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It also considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to efficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE).\nThrough extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads, we demonstrate that SPAARC significantly improves cache hit rates compared to standard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3% to 40% while reducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we present an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SPAARC parameters to achieve optimal performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SPAARC to substantially enhance the user experience in MAR applications by ensuring the timely availability of virtual objects.",

Hardware accelerators are being explored to further enhance its performance, but current solutions are often limited by application specificity and the latency of encoding and similarity search. This paper presents a generalized, reconfigurable on-chip training and inference architecture for HDC, utilizing spin-orbit-torque magnetic (SOT-MRAM) content-addressable memory (CAM). The proposed SOT-CAM array integrates storage and computation, enabling in-memory execution of key HDC operations: binding (bitwise multiplication), permutation (bit rotation), and efficient similarity search. To mitigate interconnect parasitic effect in similarity search, a four-stage voltage scaling scheme has been proposed to ensure accurate Hamming distance representation. Additionally, a novel bit drop method replaces bit rotation during read operations, and an HDC-specific adder reduces energy and area by 1.51x and 1.43x, respectively. Benchmarked at 7nm, the architecture achieves energy reductions of 21.5x, 552.74x, 1.45x, and 282.57x for addition, permutation, multiplication, and search operations, respectively, compared to CMOS-based HDC. Against state-of-the-art HD accelerators, it achieves a 2.27x lower energy consumption and outperforms CPU and eGPU implementations by 2702x and 23161x, respectively, with less than 3% drop in accuracy",

However, current CIM solutions face latency and reliability challenges. CIM fidelity lags considerably behind access fidelity. Furthermore, bulk-bitwise CIM, although highly parallelized, requires long latency for operations like multiplication and addition, due to their bit-serial computation. This paper presents Count2Multiply, a technology-agnostic digital CIM approach to perform multiplication, addition and other operations using high-radix, massively parallel counting enabled by CIM bulk-bitwise logic operations. Designed to meet fault tolerance requirements, Count2Multiply integrates traditional row-wise error correction codes, such as Hamming and BCH, to address the high error rates in existing CIM designs. We demonstrate Count2Multiply with a detailed application to CIM in conventional DRAM due to its ubiquity and high endurance. However, we note that the Count2Multiply architecture is compatible with other functionally complete CIM proposals. Compared to the state-of-the-art in-DRAM CIM method, Count2Multiply achieves up to 10x speedup, 8x higher GOPS/Watt, and 9.5x higher GOPS/area, while outperforming GPU for vector-matrix multiplications.",

    "summary": "Finite (word) state transducers extend finite state automata by defining a binary relation over finite words, called rational relation. If the rational relation is the graph of a function, this function is said to be rational. The class of sequential functions is a strict subclass of rational functions, defined as the functions recognised by input-deterministic finite state transducers. The class membership problems between those classes are known to be decidable. We consider approximate versions of these problems and show they are decidable as well. This includes the approximate functionality problem, which asks whether given a rational relation (by a transducer), is it close to a rational function, and the approximate determinisation problem, which asks whether a given rational function is close to a sequential function. We prove decidability results for several classical distances, including Hamming and Levenshtein edit distance. Finally, we investigate the approximate uniformisation problem, which asks, given a rational relation $R$, whether there exists a sequential function that is close to some function uniformising $R$. As for its exact version, we prove that this problem is undecidable.",

This parameter has emerged as a key repetitiveness measure in compressed indexing. We focus on the notion of BWT-run sensitivity after application of an injective morphism. For binary alphabets, we characterize the class of morphisms that preserve the number of BWT-runs up to a bounded additive increase, by showing that it coincides with the known class of primitivity-preserving morphisms, which are those that map primitive words to primitive words. We further prove that deciding whether a given binary morphism has bounded BWT-run sensitivity is possible in polynomial time with respect to the total length of the images of the two letters. Additionally, we explore new structural and combinatorial properties of synchronizing and recognizable morphisms. These results establish new connections between BWT-based compressibility, code theory, and symbolic dynamics.",

(The shape and size of the tree remain the same throughout.)\nOur first contribution is to show that this problem admits an $O(\\log n / \\log \\log n)$ algorithm for any fixed regular tree language, improving over known algorithms that achieve $O(\\log n)$. This generalizes the known $O(\\log n / \\log \\log n)$ upper bound over words, and it matches the lower bound of ${\\Omega}(\\log n / \\log \\log n)$ from dynamic membership to some word languages and from the existential marked ancestor problem.\nOur second contribution is to introduce a class of regular languages, dubbed almost-commutative tree languages, and show that dynamic membership to such languages under relabeling updates can be done in constant time per update. Almost-commutative languages generalize both commutative languages and finite languages, and they are the analogue for trees of the ZG languages enjoying constant-time dynamic membership over words. Our main technical contribution is to show that this class is conditionally optimal when we assume that the alphabet features a neutral letter, i.e., a letter that has no effect on membership to the language. More precisely, we show that any regular tree language with a neutral letter which is not almost-commutative cannot be maintained in constant time under the assumption that prefix-U1 problem from (Amarilli, Jachiet, Paperman, ICALP'21) also does not admit a constant-time algorithm.",

In the same vein, they provide an interesting avenue for the exploration of formal verification and mechanistic interpretability. Since the introduction of code-specific models, despite their successes in generating code in Lean4 and Isabelle, the task of generalized theorem proving still remains far from being fully solved and will be a benchmark for reasoning capability in LLMs. In this work, we introduce a framework that generates whole proofs in a formal language to be used within systems that utilize the power of built-in tactics and off-the-shelf automated theorem provers. Our framework includes 3 components: generating natural language statements of the code to be verified, an LLM that generates formal proofs for the given statement, and a module employing heuristics for building the final proof. To train the LLM, we employ a 2-stage fine-tuning process, where we first use SFT-based training to enable the model to generate syntactically correct Isabelle code and then RL-based training that encourages the model to generate proofs verified by a theorem prover. We validate our framework using the miniF2F-test benchmark and the Isabelle proof assistant and design a use case to verify the correctness of the AWS S3 bucket access policy code. We also curate a dataset based on the FVEL\\textsubscript{\\textnormal{ER}} dataset for future training tasks.",

The grammars can represent iterative, hierarchical and nested recursive structure in more than one dimension.\nThis supports a highly parallel style of parsing, in which all aspects of pattern recognition (feature detection, segmentation, parsing, filling in missing symbols, top-down and bottom-up inference) are integrated into a single process, to exploit the synergy between them.\nThe emphasis of this paper is on underlying theoretical issues, but I also give some example runs to illustrate the error-tolerant parsing of complex recursively structured patterns of 50-1000 symbols, involving variability in geometric relationships, blurry and indistinct symbols, overlapping symbols, cluttered images, and erased patches.",

    "summary": "Converting high-level tasks described by natural language into formal specifications like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is a key step towards providing formal safety guarantees over cyber-physical systems (CPS). While the compliance of the formal specifications themselves against the safety restrictions imposed on CPS is crucial for ensuring safety, most existing works only focus on translation consistency between natural languages and formal specifications. In this paper, we introduce AutoSafeLTL, a self-supervised framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of LTL specifications complying with a set of safety restrictions while preserving their logical consistency and semantic accuracy. As a key insight, our framework integrates Language Inclusion check with an automated counterexample-guided modification mechanism to ensure the safety-compliance of the resulting LTL specifications. In particular, we develop 1) an LLM-as-an-Aligner, which performs atomic proposition matching between generated LTL specifications and safety restrictions to enforce semantic alignment; and 2) an LLM-as-a-Critic, which automates LTL specification refinement by interpreting counterexamples derived from Language Inclusion checks. Experimental results demonstrate that our architecture effectively guarantees safety-compliance for the generated LTL specifications, achieving a 0% violation rate against imposed safety restrictions. This shows the potential of our work in synergizing AI and formal verification techniques, enhancing safety-aware specification generation and automatic verification for both AI and critical CPS applications.",

We derive recurrences for lengths |B(n)|, |P(n)| and symbol counts, confirming growth governed by alpha (limit |B(n+1)|/|B(n)| = alpha as n -> infinity).

Objective: We introduce the concept of Aging Debt (AD), representing the increased maintenance efforts and costs needed to keep software updated. We study AD through Self-Admitted Aging Debt (SAAD) observed in source code comments left by software developers. Method: We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analyses to detect and measure AD in software. This includes framing SAAD patterns from the source code comments after analysing the source code context, then utilizing the SAAD patterns to detect SAAD comments. In the process, we develop a taxonomy for SAAD that reflects the temporal aging of software and its associated debt. Then we utilize the taxonomy to quantify the different types of AD prevalent in OSS repositories. Results: Our proposed taxonomy categorizes temporal software aging into Active and Dormant types. Our extensive analysis of over 9,000+ Open Source Software (OSS) repositories reveals that more than 21% repositories exhibit signs of SAAD as observed from our gold standard SAAD dataset. Notably, Dormant AD emerges as the predominant category, highlighting a critical but often overlooked aspect of software maintenance. Conclusion: As software volume grows annually, so do evolutionary aging and maintenance challenges; our proposed taxonomy can aid researchers in detailed software aging studies and help practitioners develop improved and proactive maintenance strategies.",

However, existing PBR materials struggle with complex surface models, particularly high-specular and transparent surfaces. In this work, we extend intrinsic image representations to incorporate both reflection and transmission properties, enabling the synthesis of transparent materials such as glass and windows.

Second, our system simulates the transferred garments to progressively drape and untangle each garment in the outfit. Finally, the garments are rigged to the new character.

Some prior works have focused on high dynamic range (HDR) scene reconstruction, typically require capturing of multi-view sharp images with different exposure times at fixed camera positions during exposure times, which is time-consuming and challenging in practice. For a more flexible data acquisition, we propose a one-stage method: \\textbf{CasualHDRSplat} to easily and robustly reconstruct the 3D HDR scene from casually captured videos with auto-exposure enabled, even in the presence of severe motion blur and varying unknown exposure time. \\textbf{CasualHDRSplat} contains a unified differentiable physical imaging model which first applies continuous-time trajectory constraint to imaging process so that we can jointly optimize exposure time, camera response function (CRF), camera poses, and sharp 3D HDR scene.

In this paper, we present ARF-Plus, a 3D neural style transfer framework offering manageable control over perceptual factors, to systematically explore the perceptual controllability in 3D scene stylization. Four distinct types of controls - color preservation control, (style pattern) scale control, spatial (selective stylization area) control, and depth enhancement control - are proposed and integrated into this framework. Results from real-world datasets, both quantitative and qualitative, show that the four types of controls in our ARF-Plus framework successfully accomplish their corresponding perceptual controls when stylizing 3D scenes. These techniques work well for individual style inputs as well as for the simultaneous application of multiple styles within a scene. This unlocks a realm of limitless possibilities, allowing customized modifications of stylization effects and flexible merging of the strengths of different styles, ultimately enabling the creation of novel and eye-catching stylistic effects on 3D scenes.",

To simplify the problem, existing work often assumes that one agent is an expert with complete information about its peer, which can lead to biased estimates and failures in coordination. To address this challenge, we propose a nonlinear peer-aware cost estimation (N-PACE) algorithm for general-sum dynamic games. In N-PACE, using iterative linear quadratic (LQ) approximation of the nonlinear general-sum game, each agent explicitly models the learning dynamics of its peer agent while inferring their objective functions, leading to unbiased fast learning in inferring the unknown objective function of the peer agent, which is critical for task completion and safety assurance.

First, we propose a hard instance and prove that the optimal online algorithm for this instance only has a competitive ratio $<0.663$. Then, we show that a near-optimal algorithm for this instance can be generalized to work on all instances and achieve a competitive ratio $>0.662$.

While there are flourishing positive results against strategic agents for homogeneous divisible items, very few of them are known to hold in cake cutting.\nWe show that the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) mechanism, which provides desirable fairness and efficiency guarantees and achieves an incentive ratio of $2$ for homogeneous divisible items, also has an incentive ratio of $2$ in cake cutting. Remarkably, this result holds even without the free disposal assumption, which is hard to get rid of in the design of truthful cake cutting mechanisms.\nMoreover, we show that, for cake cutting, the Partial Allocation (PA) mechanism proposed by Cole et al. (EC'13), which is truthful and $1/e$-MNW for homogeneous divisible items, has an incentive ratio between $[e^{1 / e}, e]$ and when randomization is allowed, can be turned to be truthful in expectation. Given two alternatives for a trade-off between incentive ratio and Nash welfare provided by the MNW and PA mechanisms, we establish an interpolation between them for both cake cutting and homogeneous divisible items.\nFinally, we study the optimal incentive ratio achievable by envy-free cake cutting mechanisms. We first give an envy-free mechanism for two agents with an incentive ratio of $4 / 3$. Then, we show that any envy-free cake cutting mechanism with the connected pieces constraint has an incentive ratio of $\\Theta(n)$.",

    "summary": "Auctioneers often use closed auctions to create scarcity and prestige, aiming to intensify competition among a select group of high-status bidders. Advances in machine learning and AI make this strategy increasingly viable, enabling cost-effective identification of capable participants. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model to assess whether such practice can be justified from an economic perspective. We consider a setting in which bidders have i.i.d. private valuations, and the auction designer observes a noisy predictor of each bidder's valuation, which is assumed to be fully informative with some probability. Based on this noisy predictor, the designer determines how many bidders to admit -- a process we refer to as prescreening. We show that an auction with prescreening is equivalent to a standard auction (i.e., without prescreening) in which bidder valuations are correlated. Notably, the standard notion of affiliation commonly assumed in the auction literature does not generally hold in this equivalent formulation. We characterize conditions for the existence of symmetric and strictly monotone equilibrium strategies across three classical auction formats: all-pay, first-price, and second-price auctions. Our results demonstrate that prescreening with noisy predictors can significantly enhance revenue in all-pay auctions; in fact, with a perfect predictor, admitting only two bidders is optimal. By contrast, in both first-price and second-price auctions, admitting all bidders remains revenue-maximizing.",

Originally designed for natural language processing tasks such as text generation, LLMs are increasingly being used to assist both professionals and students in writing code. This growing reliance on LLM-based tools is reshaping programming workflows and task execution. In this study, we explore the impact of these technologies on blind and low-vision (BLV) developers. Our review of existing literature indicates that while LLMs help mitigate some of the challenges faced by BLV programmers, they also introduce new forms of inaccessibility. We conducted an evaluation of five popular LLM-powered integrated development environments (IDEs), assessing their performance across a comprehensive set of programming tasks. Our findings highlight several unsupported scenarios, instances of incorrect model output, and notable limitations in interaction support for specific tasks. Through observing BLV developers as they engaged in coding activities, we uncovered key interaction barriers that go beyond model accuracy or code generation quality. This paper outlines the challenges and corresponding opportunities for improving accessibility in the context of generative AI-assisted programming. Addressing these issues can meaningfully enhance the programming experience for BLV developers. As the generative AI revolution continues to unfold, it must also address the unique burdens faced by this community.",

However, it remains an open question as to how best to evaluate salience maps, with three families of evaluation methods commonly being used: subjective user measures, objective user measures, and mathematical metrics. We examine three of the most popular saliency map approaches (viz., LIME, Grad-CAM, and Guided Backpropagation) in a between subject study (N=166) across these families of evaluation methods. We test 1) for subjective measures, if the maps differ with respect to user trust and satisfaction; 2) for objective measures, if the maps increase users' abilities and thus understanding of a model; 3) for mathematical metrics, which map achieves the best ratings across metrics; and 4) whether the mathematical metrics can be associated with objective user measures. To our knowledge, our study is the first to compare several salience maps across all these evaluation methods$-$with the finding that they do not agree in their assessment (i.e., there was no difference concerning trust and satisfaction, Grad-CAM improved users' abilities best, and Guided Backpropagation had the most favorable mathematical metrics). Additionally, we show that some mathematical metrics were associated with user understanding, although this relationship was often counterintuitive. We discuss these findings in light of general debates concerning the complementary use of user studies and mathematical metrics in the evaluation of explainable AI (XAI) approaches.",

This study examines the psychological impact of such tools on self-objectification, self-esteem, and emotional responses, with attention to gender differences. Two samples used distinct versions of a facial analysis tool: one overtly critical (N=75; M=22.9 years), and another more neutral (N=51; M=19.9 years). Participants completed validated self-objectification and self-esteem scales and custom items measuring emotion, digital/physical appearance enhancement (DAE, PAEE), and perceived social emotion (PSE). Results revealed consistent links between high self-objectification, low self-esteem, and increased appearance enhancement behaviors across both versions. Despite softer framing, the newer tool still evoked negative emotional responses (U=1466.5, p=0.013), indicating implicit feedback may reinforce appearance-related insecurities. Gender differences emerged in DAE (p=0.025) and PSE (p<0.001), with females more prone to digital enhancement and less likely to perceive emotional impact in others. These findings reveal how AI tools may unintentionally reinforce and amplify existing social biases and underscore the critical need for responsible AI design and development. Future research will investigate how human ideologies embedded in the training data of such tools shape their evaluative outputs, and how these, in turn, influence user attitudes and decisions.",

    "summary": "Unresolved questions about how autonomous vehicles (AVs) should meet the informational needs of riders hinder real-world adoption. Complicating our ability to satisfy rider needs is that different people, goals, and driving contexts have different criteria for what constitutes interaction success. Unfortunately, most human-AV research and design today treats all people and situations uniformly. It is crucial to understand how an AV should communicate to meet rider needs, and how communications should change when the human-AV complex system changes. I argue that understanding the relationships between different aspects of the human-AV system can help us build improved and adaptable AV communications. I support this argument using three empirical studies. First, I identify optimal communication strategies that enhance driving performance, confidence, and trust for learning in extreme driving environments. Findings highlight the need for task-sensitive, modality-appropriate communications tuned to learner cognitive limits and goals. Next, I highlight the consequences of deploying faulty communication systems and demonstrate the need for context-sensitive communications. Third, I use machine learning (ML) to illuminate personal factors predicting trust in AVs, emphasizing the importance of tailoring designs to individual traits and concerns. Together, this dissertation supports the necessity of transparent, adaptable, and personalized AV systems that cater to individual needs, goals, and contextual demands. By considering the complex system within which human-AV interactions occur, we can deliver valuable insights for designers, researchers, and policymakers. This dissertation also provides a concrete domain to study theories of human-machine joint action and situational awareness, and can be used to guide future human-AI interaction research.

Unlike conventional captioning systems that offer only plain text, our system fuses real-time speech recognition with affective and visual signal interpretation, including facial movements, gestures, and vocal tone, to produce emotionally enriched captions. These enhanced captions are rendered in an AR interface developed with Unity and provide contextual annotations such as speaker tone markers (e.g., \"concerned\") and gesture indicators (e.g., \"nods\"). The system leverages live camera and microphone input, processed through AI models to detect multimodal cues. Findings from preliminary evaluations suggest that this AR-based captioning approach significantly enhances comprehension and reduces cognitive effort compared to standard captions.

    "summary": "In recent years, Channel State Information (CSI), recognized for its fine-grained spatial characteristics, has attracted increasing attention in WiFi-based indoor localization. However, despite its potential, CSI-based approaches have yet to achieve the same level of deployment scale and commercialization as those based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). A key limitation lies in the fact that most existing CSI-based systems are developed and evaluated in controlled, small-scale environments, limiting their generalizability. To bridge this gap, we explore the deployment of a large-scale CSI-based localization system involving over 400 Access Points (APs) in a real-world building under the Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) paradigm. We highlight two critical yet often overlooked factors: the underutilization of unlabeled data and the inherent heterogeneity of CSI measurements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI-based learning framework for WiFi localization, tailored for large-scale ISAC deployments on the server side. Specifically, we employ a novel graph-based structure to model heterogeneous CSI data and reduce redundancy. We further design a pretext pretraining task that incorporates spatial and temporal priors to effectively leverage large-scale unlabeled CSI data. Complementarily, we introduce a confidence-aware fine-tuning strategy to enhance the robustness of localization results. In a leave-one-smartphone-out experiment spanning five floors and 25, 600 m2, we achieve a median localization error of 2.17 meters and a floor accuracy of 99.49%. This performance corresponds to an 18.7% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the best-performing baseline.",

Creators can express their interpretations of music naturally through visual elements. However, the creation process of music video demands proficiency in script design, video shooting, and music-video synchronization, posing significant challenges for non-professionals. Previous work has designed automated music video generation frameworks. However, they suffer from complexity in input and poor output quality. In response, we present MV-Crafter, a system capable of producing high-quality music videos with synchronized music-video rhythm and style. Our approach involves three technical modules that simulate the human creation process: the script generation module, video generation module, and music-video synchronization module. MV-Crafter leverages a large language model to generate scripts considering the musical semantics. To address the challenge of synchronizing short video clips with music of varying lengths, we propose a dynamic beat matching algorithm and visual envelope-induced warping method to ensure precise, monotonic music-video synchronization. Besides, we design a user-friendly interface to simplify the creation process with intuitive editing features. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that MV-Crafter provides an effective solution for improving the quality of generated music videos.",

In particular, hands-free locomotion offers a valuable alternative by supporting accessibility and freeing users from reliance on handheld controllers. To this end, traditional speech-based methods often depend on rigid command sets, limiting the naturalness and flexibility of interaction. In this study, we propose a novel locomotion technique powered by large language models (LLMs), which allows users to navigate virtual environments using natural language with contextual awareness. We evaluate three locomotion methods: controller-based teleportation, voice-based steering, and our language model-driven approach. Our evaluation measures include eye-tracking data analysis, including explainable machine learning through SHAP analysis as well as standardized questionnaires for usability, presence, cybersickness, and cognitive load to examine user attention and engagement. Our findings indicate that the LLM-driven locomotion possesses comparable usability, presence, and cybersickness scores to established methods like teleportation, demonstrating its novel potential as a comfortable, natural language-based, hands-free alternative. In addition, it enhances user attention within the virtual environment, suggesting greater engagement. Complementary to these findings, SHAP analysis revealed that fixation, saccade, and pupil-related features vary across techniques, indicating distinct patterns of visual attention and cognitive processing. Overall, we state that our method can facilitate hands-free locomotion in virtual spaces, especially in supporting accessibility.",

We propose an improvement of the MDM involving a number of power means of SPD matrices instead of the sole geometric mean. By the analysis of 20 public databases, 10 for the motor-imagery BCI paradigm and 10 for the P300 BCI paradigm, comprising 587 individuals in total, we show that the proposed classifier clearly outperforms the MDM, approaching the state-of-the art in terms of performance while retaining the simplicity and the deterministic behavior. In order to promote reproducible research, our code will be released as open source.",

Then, using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI 100-4 report as a reflection of current synthetic content governance methods, we show how the current landscape of practices fails to effectively regulate the MTE for adult AIG-NCII, as well as flawed assumptions explaining these gaps.",

AI has the potential to revolutionize education by helping teaching staff with various tasks, such as personalizing their teaching methods, but it also raises concerns, for example, about the degradation of student-teacher interactions and user privacy. This paper introduces INSIGHT, a proof of concept to combine various AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of solving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated into various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM by extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students' questions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more personalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by using the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based on student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and inclusive learning experience.",

However, current research workflows are highly fragmented, as researchers must use separate tools for system implementation, participant recruitment, experiment execution, and data collection, reducing consistency and increasing workload. We present LUIDA (Large-scale Unified Infrastructure for Digital Assessments), a metaverse-based framework that integrates these fragmented processes. LUIDA automatically allocates interconnected virtual environments for parallel experiment execution and provides implementation templates adaptable to various VR research domains, requiring minimal metaverse development expertise. Our evaluation included two studies using a prototype built on Cluster, the commercial metaverse platform. First, VR researchers using LUIDA to develop and run experiments reported high usability scores (SUS: 73.75) and moderate workload (NASA-TLX: 24.11) for overall usage, with interviews confirming streamlined workflows compared to traditional laboratory experiments. Second, we conducted three replicated experiments with public Cluster users, each recruiting approximately 200 participants within one week. These experiments produced results that closely matched the original studies, validating the experimental integrity of LUIDA across research domains. After technical refinements, we plan to release LUIDA as an open platform, providing a standardized protocol to improve research efficiency and experimental reproducibility in VR studies.",

Together, these mechanisms operationalize cybernetic principles--human sensing, machine bookkeeping, real-time feedback--while minimizing dependence on privileged roles.\nOur exploratory data (567 chore claims, 255 heart events, and 551 group purchases) show that such tooling can sustain reliable commons governance without continuous leadership, offering a transferable design palette for online communities, coliving houses, and other digitally mediated collectives.",

Clinician shortage and stigma urge the development of human-LLM interactive psychotherapy for CR. Yet, existing efforts implement CR via simple text rewriting, fixed-pattern dialogues, or a one-shot CR workflow, failing to align with the psychotherapeutic process for effective CR. To address this gap, we propose CRDial, a novel framework for CR, which creates multi-turn dialogues with specifically designed identification and restructuring stages of negative thoughts, integrates sentence-level supportive conversation strategies, and adopts a multi-channel loop mechanism to enable iterative CR. With CRDial, we distill Crisp, a large-scale and high-quality bilingual dialogue dataset, from LLM. We then train Crispers, Crisp-based conversational LLMs for CR, at 7B and 14B scales. Extensive human studies show the superiority of Crispers in pointwise, pairwise, and intervention evaluations.",

To address this gap, we conducted qualitative research on decision-making within a law enforcement agency. Our study aimed to identify limitations of existing practices, explore user requirements and understand the responsibilities that humans expect to undertake in these systems.\nParticipants in our study highlighted the need for a system capable of processing and analysing large volumes of data efficiently to help in crime detection and prevention. Additionally, the system should satisfy requirements for scalability, accuracy, justification, trustworthiness and adaptability to be adopted in this domain. Participants also emphasised the importance of having end users review the input data that might be challenging for AI to interpret, and validate the generated output to ensure the system's accuracy. To keep up with the evolving nature of the law enforcement domain, end users need to help the system adapt to the changes in criminal behaviour and government guidance, and technical experts need to regularly oversee and monitor the system. Furthermore, user-friendly human interaction with the system is essential for its adoption and some of the participants confirmed they would be happy to be in the loop and provide necessary feedback that the system can learn from. Finally, we argue that it is very unlikely that the system will ever achieve full automation due to the dynamic and complex nature of the law enforcement domain.",

Existing research fails to consider the impact of the sequence of actions, as well as the effects of EHMI applications and deception, raising the question of whether benevolent, well-intentioned deception should be permitted (i.e., misleading statements that are intended to benefit both parties). We established a game theory based EHMI information disclosure framework for AVs in this study. In considering benevolent deception, this framework divided the decision-making process into three stages, respectively encompassing three key questions: whether to disclose, when to disclose, and what type of intention information to disclose. The results show that theoretical advantages of deception exist in certain cases when AV expects to maximize the safety of the interaction. In 40 out of 484 cases (8.3%), safety can be enhanced through successful deception. Those successful deceptions fall into two categories: 1) In 28 of these cases, the straight-going AV expected the left-turning HV to yield, while HV exhibited lower speed and higher acceleration; 2) In 12 of these cases, AV expected HV to proceed first, while HV exhibited higher speed and lower acceleration. We also conducted a VR-based driving simulation experiment, and the results confirmed our conclusion. Additionally, we found that when participants had low trust in the EHMI, its use negatively impacted interaction efficiency instead. This study aims to analyze the mechanisms of EHMI information disclosure and contribute to the ongoing discourse on the ethical framework governing autonomous driving systems.",

    "summary": "Visual-vestibular conflicts (VVCs) are a primary contributor to visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) in head-mounted displays (HMDs). However, virtual reality (VR) comfort studies often rely on exposing seated or standing users to experiences with high intensity visual motion (such as roller coasters). These drastic VVCs tend to induce pronounced VIMS symptoms that can be reliably detected across individuals using common survey measures. The conclusions from studies using these extreme motion-based conflicts may not accurately generalize to naturalistic use cases in VR where efforts are made to minimize, rather than maximize, VIMS symptoms. In this work, we show that a subthreshold visual-vestibular conflict can induce measurable discomfort during naturalistic, long duration use. We first present a psychophysical study, conducted outside of an HMD, to rigorously identify the perceptual thresholds for sinusoidal noise in render pose (i.e., jitter) resulting in erroneous 3D motion of rendered content. We next introduce subthreshold levels of jitter to a Meta Quest 3 VR HMD and demonstrate that this can induce visual discomfort in participants playing the commercially-available game Cubism across a three-session, repeated-measures study. Importantly, we did not identify statistically significant comfort differences between control and jitter conditions with traditional pre- and post-test comparison of Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) scores. Significant differences were only identified using the Motion Illness Symptoms Classification (MISC) survey administered every 10 minutes across each 90 minute session. This highlights the benefits of incorporating time-resolved data points and suggests that lightweight, more frequent surveys may be important tools for measuring visual discomfort in more ecologically-valid scenarios.",

SP generalizes the previous flat block or cluster-based pruning, allowing the early detection of groups of documents that cannot or are less likely to appear in the final top-k list.

    "summary": "In e-commerce, user representations are essential for various applications. Existing methods often use deep learning techniques to convert customer behaviors into implicit embeddings. However, these embeddings are difficult to understand and integrate with external knowledge, limiting the effectiveness of applications such as customer segmentation, search navigation, and product recommendations. To address this, our paper introduces the concept of the customer persona. Condensed from a customer's numerous purchasing histories, a customer persona provides a multi-faceted and human-readable characterization of specific purchase behaviors and preferences, such as Busy Parents or Bargain Hunters.\nThis work then focuses on representing each customer by multiple personas from a predefined set, achieving readable and informative explicit user representations. To this end, we propose an effective and efficient solution GPLR. To ensure effectiveness, GPLR leverages pre-trained LLMs to infer personas for customers. To reduce overhead, GPLR applies LLM-based labeling to only a fraction of users and utilizes a random walk technique to predict personas for the remaining customers. We further propose RevAff, which provides an absolute error $\\epsilon$ guarantee while improving the time complexity of the exact solution by a factor of at least $O(\\frac{\\epsilon\\cdot|E|N}{|E|+N\\log N})$, where $N$ represents the number of customers and products, and $E$ represents the interactions between them. We evaluate the performance of our persona-based representation in terms of accuracy and robustness for recommendation and customer segmentation tasks using three real-world e-commerce datasets. Most notably, we find that integrating customer persona representations improves the state-of-the-art graph convolution-based recommendation model by up to 12% in terms of NDCG@K and F1-Score@K.",

    "summary": "Conversational recommender systems aim to provide personalized recommendations by analyzing and utilizing contextual information related to dialogue. However, existing methods typically model the dialogue context as a whole, neglecting the inherent complexity and entanglement within the dialogue. Specifically, a dialogue comprises both focus information and background information, which mutually influence each other. Current methods tend to model these two types of information mixedly, leading to misinterpretation of users' actual needs, thereby lowering the accuracy of recommendations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel model to introduce contextual disentanglement for improving conversational recommender systems, named DisenCRS. The proposed model DisenCRS employs a dual disentanglement framework, including self-supervised contrastive disentanglement and counterfactual inference disentanglement, to effectively distinguish focus information and background information from the dialogue context under unsupervised conditions. Moreover, we design an adaptive prompt learning module to automatically select the most suitable prompt based on the specific dialogue context, fully leveraging the power of large language models. Experimental results on two widely used public datasets demonstrate that DisenCRS significantly outperforms existing conversational recommendation models, achieving superior performance on both item recommendation and response generation tasks.",

    "summary": "Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have driven the emergence of complex new systems to provide access to information, that we will collectively refer to as modular generative information access (GenIA) systems. They integrate a broad and evolving range of specialized components, including LLMs, retrieval models, and a heterogeneous set of sources and tools. While modularity offers flexibility, it also raises critical challenges: How can we systematically characterize the space of possible modules and their interactions? How can we automate and optimize interactions among these heterogeneous components? And, how do we enable this modular system to dynamically adapt to varying user query requirements and evolving module capabilities? In this perspective paper, we argue that the architecture of future modular generative information access systems will not just assemble powerful components, but enable a self-organizing system through real-time adaptive orchestration -- where components' interactions are dynamically configured for each user input, maximizing information relevance while minimizing computational overhead. We give provisional answers to the questions raised above with a roadmap that depicts the key principles and methods for designing such an adaptive modular system. We identify pressing challenges, and propose avenues for addressing them in the years ahead. This perspective urges the IR community to rethink modular system designs for developing adaptive, self-optimizing, and future-ready architectures that evolve alongside their rapidly advancing underlying technologies.",

    "summary": "Generative retrieval (GR) has emerged as a promising paradigm in information retrieval (IR). However, most existing GR models are developed and evaluated using a static document collection, and their performance in dynamic corpora where document collections evolve continuously is rarely studied. In this paper, we first reproduce and systematically evaluate various representative GR approaches over dynamic corpora. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that existing GR models with \\textit{text-based} docids show superior generalization to unseen documents. We observe that the more fine-grained the docid design in the GR model, the better its performance over dynamic corpora, surpassing BM25 and even being comparable to dense retrieval methods. While GR models with \\textit{numeric-based} docids show high efficiency, their performance drops significantly over dynamic corpora. Furthermore, our experiments find that the underperformance of numeric-based docids is partly due to their excessive tendency toward the initial document set, which likely results from overfitting on the training set. We then conduct an in-depth analysis of the best-performing GR methods. We identify three critical advantages of text-based docids in dynamic corpora: (i) Semantic alignment with language models' pretrained knowledge, (ii) Fine-grained docid design, and (iii) High lexical diversity. Building on these insights, we finally propose a novel multi-docid design that leverages both the efficiency of numeric-based docids and the effectiveness of text-based docids, achieving improved performance in dynamic corpus without requiring additional retraining. Our work offers empirical evidence for advancing GR methods over dynamic corpora and paves the way for developing more generalized yet efficient GR models in real-world search engines.",

However, optimizing models to handle such changes in real-time remains a major challenge in large-scale industrial settings. To address this, we propose the Interest-aware Representation and Alignment (IRA) framework, an efficient and scalable approach that dynamically adapts to new interactions through a cumulative structure. IRA leverages two key mechanisms: (1) Interest Units that capture diverse user interests as contextual texts, while reinforcing or fading over time through cumulative updates, and (2) a retrieval process that measures the relevance between Interest Units and documents based solely on semantic relationships, eliminating dependence on click signals to mitigate temporal biases. By integrating cumulative Interest Unit updates with the retrieval process, IRA continuously adapts to evolving user preferences, ensuring robust and fine-grained personalization without being constrained by past training distributions. We validate the effectiveness of IRA through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including its deployment in the Home Section of NAVER's CAFE, South Korea's leading community platform.",

It leverages heterogeneous modalities such as text, images, and behavioral logs to capture high-order feature interactions between users and items, thereby enhancing the system's understanding of user interests and its ability to predict click behavior. The primary challenge in this field lies in effectively utilizing the rich semantic information from multiple modalities while satisfying the low-latency requirements of online inference in real-world applications. To foster progress in this area, the Multimodal CTR Prediction Challenge Track of the WWW 2025 EReL@MIR Workshop formulates the problem into two tasks: (1) Task 1 of Multimodal Item Embedding: this task aims to explore multimodal information extraction and item representation learning methods that enhance recommendation tasks; and (2) Task 2 of Multimodal CTR Prediction: this task aims to explore what multimodal recommendation model can effectively leverage multimodal embedding features and achieve better performance. In this paper, we propose a novel model for Task 2, named Quadratic Interest Network (QIN) for Multimodal CTR Prediction. Specifically, QIN employs adaptive sparse target attention to extract multimodal user behavior features, and leverages Quadratic Neural Networks to capture high-order feature interactions. As a result, QIN achieved an AUC of 0.9798 on the leaderboard and ranked second in the competition.

However, deploying large-scale LLMs introduces significant efficiency challenges, primarily high computational costs during fine-tuning and inference due to their massive parameterization. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a promising solution, transferring expertise from large teacher models to compact student models. This study systematically investigates knowledge distillation approaches for bundle generation, aiming to minimize computational demands while preserving performance. We explore three critical research questions: (1) how does the format of KD impact bundle generation performance? (2) to what extent does the quantity of distilled knowledge influence performance? and (3) how do different ways of utilizing the distilled knowledge affect performance? We propose a comprehensive KD framework that (i) progressively extracts knowledge (patterns, rules, deep thoughts); (ii) captures varying quantities of distilled knowledge through different strategies; and (iii) exploits complementary LLM adaptation techniques (in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, combination) to leverage distilled knowledge in small student models for domain-specific adaptation and enhanced efficiency. Extensive experiments provide valuable insights into how knowledge format, quantity, and utilization methodologies collectively shape LLM-based bundle generation performance, exhibiting KD's significant potential for more efficient yet effective LLM-based bundle generation.",

It aims to synthesize images tailored to individual style preferences (e.g., color schemes, character appearances, layout) and semantic intentions (e.g., emotion, action, scene contexts) by leveraging user-interacted history images and multimodal instructions. Despite notable progress, existing methods -- whether based on diffusion models, large language models, or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) -- struggle to accurately capture and fuse user style preferences and semantic intentions. In particular, the state-of-the-art LMM-based method suffers from the entanglement of visual features, leading to Guidance Collapse, where the generated images fail to preserve user-preferred styles or reflect the specified semantics.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce DRC, a novel personalized image generation framework that enhances LMMs through Disentangled Representation Composition. DRC explicitly extracts user style preferences and semantic intentions from history images and the reference image, respectively, to form user-specific latent instructions that guide image generation within LMMs. Specifically, it involves two critical learning stages: 1) Disentanglement learning, which employs a dual-tower disentangler to explicitly separate style and semantic features, optimized via a reconstruction-driven paradigm with difficulty-aware importance sampling; and 2) Personalized modeling, which applies semantic-preserving augmentations to effectively adapt the disentangled representations for robust personalized generation. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that DRC shows competitive performance while effectively mitigating the guidance collapse issue, underscoring the importance of disentangled representation learning for controllable and effective personalized image generation.",

    "summary": "As semantic communication (SemCom) gains increasing attention as a novel communication paradigm, ensuring the security of transmitted semantic information over open wireless channels becomes crucial. Existing secure SemCom solutions often lack explicit control over security. To address this, we propose a coding-enhanced jamming approach for secure SemCom over wiretap channels. This approach integrates deep joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC) with neural network-based digital modulation, enabling controlled jamming through two-layer superposition coding. The outer constellation sequence encodes the source image, while the inner constellation sequence, derived from a secret image, acts as the jamming signal. By minimizing the mutual information between the outer and inner constellation sequences, the jamming effect is enhanced. The jamming signal is superposed on the outer constellation sequence, preventing the eavesdropper from recovering the source image. The power allocation coefficient (PAC) in the superposition coding can be adjusted to control system security. Experiments show that our approach matches existing methods in security while significantly improving reconstruction performance across varying channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and compression ratios.",

These divergence families include the density power divergence and the $\\gamma$-divergence as special cases. First, we prove that the intersection of the Hölder divergence and the FDPD is limited to a general divergence family introduced by Jones et al. (Biometrika, 2001). Subsequently, motivated by the fact that Hölder's inequality is used in the proofs of nonnegativity for both the Hölder divergence and the FDPD, we define a generalized divergence family, referred to as the $\\xi$-Hölder divergence. The nonnegativity of the $\\xi$-Hölder divergence is established through a combination of the inequalities used to prove the nonnegativity of the Hölder divergence and the FDPD. Furthermore, we derive an inequality between the composite scoring rules corresponding to different FDPDs based on the $\\xi$-Hölder divergence. Finally, we prove that imposing the mathematical structure of the Hölder score on a composite scoring rule results in the $\\xi$-Hölder divergence.",

    "summary": "The service rate region (SRR) has emerged as a critical performance metric for distributed systems that store data redundantly. It measures the system's ability to serve multiple users concurrently. Mathematically, the SRR is a polytope in R^k where each dimension corresponds to the service request rate of one of the k data objects. This paper focuses on systems employing a class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes. For each code in the class, we characterize the k axes intercept points of its SRR, and the smallest standard simplex that includes the SRR. We use these results to show that the SRR grows with the increasing number of systematic columns in the generator matrices. We establish a graph-theoretic framework associating this SRR problem with fractional matchings in quasi-uniform hypergraphs. Identifying the SRR polytope is equivalent to determining a particular image of the fractional-matching polytope. We introduce a notion of Greedy Matching and show that it is sufficient to focus on these matchings to characterize the SRR rather than the entire matching polytope. With these tools, we determine the SRR of a large subset of the considered class of codes. Our results generalize previous characterizations of systematic and non-systematic MDS-coded systems, offering a unified framework for analyzing service rate regions of codes.",

We show that this flexibility leads to a considerable reduction in the error probability compared to a fixed number of reads, not only in terms of constants in the error exponent but also in the scaling laws. This is shown via an achievability result for a suitably-designed protocol, and in certain parameter regimes we additionally establish a matching converse that holds for all protocols within a broader concatenated coding based class.",

    "summary": "In the short block length regime, pre-transformed polar codes together with successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding possess excellent error correction capabilities. However, in practice, the list size is limited due to the suboptimal scaling of the required area in hardware implementations. Automorphism ensemble decoding (AED) can improve performance for a fixed list size by running multiple parallel SCL decodings on permuted received words, yielding a list of estimates from which the final estimate is selected. Yet, AED is limited to appropriately designed polar codes. Subcode ensemble decoding (ScED) was recently proposed for low-density parity-check codes and does not impose such design constraints. It uses multiple decodings in different subcodes, ensuring that the selected subcodes jointly cover the original code. We extend ScED to polar codes by expressing polar subcodes through suitable pre-transformations (PTs). To this end, we describe a framework classifying pre-transformations for pre-transformed polar codes based on their role in encoding and decoding. Within this framework, we propose a new type of PT enabling ScED for polar codes, analyze its properties, and discuss how to construct an efficient ensemble.",

In Part I of the two-part paper, we have investigated securely computing linear functions with the wiretapper who can eavesdrop any edge subset up to a certain size r, referred to as the security level, where the security function is the identity function. The notion of this security is called source security. In the current paper, we consider another interesting model which is the same as the above one except that the security function is identical to the target function, i.e., we need to protect the information on the target function from being leaked to the wiretapper. The notion of this security is called target-function security. We first prove a non-trivial upper bound on the secure computing capacity, which is applicable to arbitrary network topologies and arbitrary security levels. In particular, when the security level r is equal to 0, the upper bound reduces to the computing capacity without security consideration. Further, from an algebraic point of view, we prove two equivalent conditions for target-function security and source security for the existence of the corresponding linear function-computing secure network codes. With them, for any linear function over a given finite field, we develop a code construction of linear secure network codes for target-function security and thus obtain a lower bound on the secure computing capacity; and also generalize the code construction developed in Part I for source security.",

Recent theoretical advancements highlight that an ISAC system will be overwhelmed by the increasing number of active devices, driven by the growth of massive machine-type communication (mMTC). To meet the demands of future mMTC network, fundamental solutions are required that ensure robust capacity while maintaining favorable energy and spectral efficiency. One promising approach to support emerging massive connectivity is the development of systems based on the unsourced ISAC (UNISAC) framework. This paper proposes a spectrum-sharing compressive sensing-based UNISAC (SSCS-UNISAC) and offers insights into the practical design of UNISAC multiple access codes. In this framework, both communication signals (data transmission) and sensing signals (e.g., radar echoes) overlap within finite channel uses and are transmitted via the proposed UNISAC protocol. The proposed decoder exhibits robust performance, providing 20-30 dB capacity gains compared to conventional protocols such as TDMA and ALOHA. Numerical results validate the promising performance of the proposed scheme.",

We present two CE strategies based on the activation of different FAS ports, namely alternate ports and partial ports CE. Both strategies facilitate the estimation of channel coefficients and angles of arrival (AoAs). Additionally, we discuss how to refine channel estimation by leveraging the sparsity of finite scatterers. Specifically, the proposed partial ports CE strategy is implemented using a regularized estimator, and we optimize the estimator's parameter to achieve the desired AoA precision and refinement.

Specifically, substantial channel measurement campaigns with distances up to 410~m are conducted at 220~GHz, with nanosecond-level absolute time synchronization. Based on the measurement results, the propagation phenomena are analyzed in detail and the channel characteristics are calculated and statistically modeled. Furthermore, a digital twin enabled channel model (DTECM) is proposed, which generates THz channel responses in a hybrid manner. Specifically, the dominant paths are generated deterministically by using the ray-tracing technique and CV methods. Apart from the path gains determined by ray-tracing, the additional foliage loss is accurately modeled based on foliage information extracted from panoramic pictures. To maintain a low computational complexity for the DTECM, non-dominant paths are then generated statistically. Numeric results reveal that compared to the traditional statistical channel models, the DTECM reduces the path loss modeling error from 14~dB to 4~dB, showing its great superiority. Furthermore, a preliminary link performance evaluation using the DTECM indicates that THz UMa is feasible, though requiring high antenna gains and coverage extension techniques to achieve high spectral efficiencies and wide coverage.",

To quantify stealthiness, we employ the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, a measure rooted in hypothesis testing and detection theory, which captures the trade-off between an attacker's desire to remain stealthy and her goal of degrading system performance. First, we synthesize the worst-case stealthy attack in nonlinear CPS using the path integral approach. Second, we consider how a controller can mitigate the impact of such stealthy attacks by formulating a minimax KL control problem, yielding a zero-sum game between the attacker and the controller. Again, we leverage a path integral-based solution that computes saddle-point policies for both players through Monte Carlo simulations. We validate our approach using unicycle navigation and cruise control problems, demonstrating how an attacker can covertly drive the system into unsafe regions, and how the controller can adapt her policy to combat the worst-case attacks.",

    "summary": "In this work, we propose a joint design of encoding and encryption processes for KEMs like Kyber, without assuming the independence of the decoding noise entries. Our design features two techniques: ciphertext packing and lattice packing. First, we extend the Peikert-Vaikuntanathan-Waters (PVW) method to the Kyber: $\\ell$ plaintexts are packed into a single ciphertext. This scheme is referred to as P$_\\ell$-Kyber. We prove that the P$_\\ell$-Kyber is IND-CCA secure under the M-LWE hardness assumption. We show that the decryption decoding noise entries across the $\\ell$ plaintexts (also known as layers) are mutually independent. Second, we propose a cross-layer lattice encoding scheme for the P$_\\ell$-Kyber, where every $\\ell$ cross-layer information symbols are encoded to a lattice point. This way we obtain a \\emph{coded} P$_\\ell$-Kyber, where the decoding noise entries for each lattice point are mutually independent. Therefore, the decryption failure rate (DFR) analysis does not require the assumption of independence among the decryption decoding noise entries. Both DFR and communication cost (CER) are greatly decreased thanks to ciphertext packing and lattice packing. Finally, we demonstrate that with $\\ell=24$ and Leech lattice encoder, the proposed coded P$_\\ell$-KYBER1024 achieves DFR $<2^{-281}$ and CER $ = 4.6$, i.e., a decrease of CER by $90\\%$ compared to KYBER1024.",

However, in realistic scenarios, we show that QRE scales logarithmically with the inverse of the thermal noise mean photon number.

    "summary": "This paper considers the quality-of-service (QoS)-based joint beamforming and compression design problem in the downlink cooperative cellular network, where multiple relay-like base stations (BSs), connected to the central processor via rate-limited fronthaul links, cooperatively transmit messages to the users. The problem of interest is formulated as the minimization of the total transmit power of the BSs, subject to all users' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints and all BSs' fronthaul rate constraints. In this paper, we first show that there is no duality gap between the considered joint optimization problem and its Lagrangian dual by showing the tightness of its semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Then, we propose an efficient algorithm based on the above duality result for solving the considered problem. The proposed algorithm judiciously exploits the special structure of an enhanced Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the considered problem and finds the solution that satisfies the enhanced KKT conditions via two fixed point iterations. Two key features of the proposed algorithm are: (1) it is able to detect whether the considered problem is feasible or not and find its globally optimal solution when it is feasible; (2) it is highly efficient because both of the fixed point iterations in the proposed algorithm are linearly convergent and evaluating the functions in the fixed point iterations are computationally cheap. Numerical results show the global optimality and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

    "summary": "By the seminal paper of Claude Shannon \\cite{Shannon48}, the computation of the capacity of a discrete memoryless channel has been considered as one of the most important and fundamental problems in Information Theory. Nearly 50 years ago, Arimoto and Blahut independently proposed identical algorithms to solve this problem in their seminal papers \\cite{Arimoto1972AnAF, Blahut1972ComputationOC}. The Arimoto-Blahut algorithm was proven to converge to the capacity of the channel as $t \\to \\infty$ with the convergence rate upper bounded by $O\\left(\\log(m)/t\\right)$, where $m$ is the size of the input distribution, and being inverse exponential when there is a unique solution in the interior of the input probability simplex \\cite{Arimoto1972AnAF}. Recently it was proved, in \\cite{Nakagawa2020AnalysisOT}, that the convergence rate is at worst inverse linear $O(1/t)$ in some specific cases.\nIn this paper, we revisit this fundamental algorithm looking at the rate of convergence to the capacity and the time complexity, given $m,n$, where $n$ is size of the output of the channel, focusing on the approximation of the capacity. We prove that the rate of convergence to an $\\varepsilon$-optimal solution, for any sufficiently small constant $\\varepsilon > 0$, is inverse exponential $O\\left(\\log(m)/c^t\\right)$, for a constant $c > 1$ and $O\\left(\\log \\left(\\log (m)/\\varepsilon\\right)\\right)$ at most iterations, implying $O\\left(m n\\log \\left(\\log (m)/\\varepsilon\\right)\\right)$ total complexity of the algorithm.",

    "summary": "The growing privacy concerns in distributed learning have led to the widespread adoption of secure aggregation techniques in distributed machine learning systems, such as federated learning. Motivated by a coded gradient aggregation problem in a user-helper-master hierarchical network setting with straggling communication links, we formulate a new secure hierarchical coded gradient aggregation problem. In our setting, \\( K \\) users communicate with the master through an intermediate layer of \\( N \\) helpers, who can communicate with each other. With a resiliency threshold of \\( N_r \\) for straggling communication links, and at most \\( T \\) colluding helpers and any number of colluding users, the master aims to recover the sum of all users' gradients while remaining unaware of any individual gradient that exceeds the expected sum. In addition, helpers cannot infer more about users' gradients than what is already known by the colluding users. We propose an achievable scheme where users' upload messages are based on a globally known Vandermonde matrix, and helper communication is facilitated using an extended Vandermonde matrix with special structural properties. A matching converse bound is also derived, establishing the optimal result for this hierarchical coded gradient aggregation problem.",

In essence, an NNC is a duplication channel with structured, Markov inputs, that is corrupted by memoryless noise. We first discuss a (tight) lower bound on the capacity of the NNC in the absence of random noise. Next, we present lower and upper bounds on the channel capacity of general noisy nanopore channels. We then consider two interesting regimes of operation of an NNC: first, where the memory of the input process is large and the random noise introduces erasures, and second, where the rate of measurements of the electric current (also called the sampling rate) is high. For these regimes, we show that it is possible to achieve information rates close to the noise-free capacity, using low-complexity encoding and decoding schemes. In particular, our decoder for the regime of high sampling rates makes use of a change-point detection procedure -- a subroutine of immediate relevance for practitioners.",

The distributions of the $M$ data sequences belong to $K$ underlying distribution clusters. Existing results on exponentially consistent nonparametric clustering algorithms, like single linkage-based (SLINK) clustering and $k$-medoids distribution clustering, assume that the maximum intra-cluster distance ($d_L$) is smaller than the minimum inter-cluster distance ($d_H$). First, in the fixed sample size (FSS) setting, we show that exponential consistency can be achieved for SLINK clustering under a less strict assumption, $d_I < d_H$, where $d_I$ is the maximum distance between any two sub-clusters of a cluster that partition the cluster. Note that $d_I < d_L$ in general. Thus, our results show that SLINK is exponentially consistent for a larger class of problems than previously known. In our simulations, we also identify examples where $k$-medoids clustering is unable to find the true clusters, but SLINK is exponentially consistent. Then, we propose a sequential clustering algorithm, named SLINK-SEQ, based on SLINK and prove that it is also exponentially consistent. Simulation results show that the SLINK-SEQ algorithm requires fewer expected number of samples than the FSS SLINK algorithm for the same probability of error.",

By deploying ROMA panels at both the transmitter and receiver sides, and jointly optimizing the three-dimensional (3D) rotation angles of each ROMA panel and the relative positions of antenna elements based on the spatial distribution of users and channel state information (CSI), we can achieve the objective of maximizing the average spectral efficiency (SE). Subsequently, we conduct a detailed analysis of the average SE performance of the system under the consideration of maximum ratio (MR) precoding. Due to the non-convexity of the optimization problem in the ROMA multi-user MIMO system, we propose an efficient solution based on an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the AO-based ROMA architecture can significantly improve the average SE. Furthermore, the performance improvement becomes more pronounced as the size of the movable region and the transmission power increase.",

    "summary": "The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a foundational stride towards deciphering the fundamentals of complex biological systems. Inferring a possible regulatory link between two genes can be formulated as a link prediction problem. Inference of GRNs via gene coexpression profiling data may not always reflect true biological interactions, as its susceptibility to noise and misrepresenting true biological regulatory relationships. Most GRN inference methods face several challenges in the network reconstruction phase. Therefore, it is important to encode gene expression values, leverege the prior knowledge gained from the available inferred network structures and positional informations of the input network nodes towards inferring a better and more confident GRN network reconstruction. In this paper, we explore the integration of multiple inferred networks to enhance the inference of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). Primarily, we employ autoencoder embeddings to capture gene expression patterns directly from raw data, preserving intricate biological signals. Then, we embed the prior knowledge from GRN structures transforming them into a text-like representation using random walks, which are then encoded with a masked language model, BERT, to generate global embeddings for each gene across all networks. Additionally, we embed the positional encodings of the input gene networks to better identify the position of each unique gene within the graph. These embeddings are integrated into graph transformer-based model, termed GT-GRN, for GRN inference. The GT-GRN model effectively utilizes the topological structure of the ground truth network while incorporating the enriched encoded information. Experimental results demonstrate that GT-GRN significantly outperforms existing GRN inference methods, achieving superior accuracy and highlighting the robustness of our approach.",

In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework to analyze the feasibility of automatically detecting hallucinations produced by large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the classical Gold-Angluin framework for language identification and its recent adaptation to language generation by Kleinberg and Mullainathan, we investigate whether an algorithm, trained on examples drawn from an unknown target language $K$ (selected from a countable collection) and given access to an LLM, can reliably determine whether the LLM's outputs are correct or constitute hallucinations.\nFirst, we establish an equivalence between hallucination detection and the classical task of language identification. We prove that any hallucination detection method can be converted into a language identification method, and conversely, algorithms solving language identification can be adapted for hallucination detection. Given the inherent difficulty of language identification, this implies that hallucination detection is fundamentally impossible for most language collections if the detector is trained using only correct examples from the target language.\nSecond, we show that the use of expert-labeled feedback, i.e., training the detector with both positive examples (correct statements) and negative examples (explicitly labeled incorrect statements), dramatically changes this conclusion. Under this enriched training regime, automated hallucination detection becomes possible for all countable language collections.\nThese results highlight the essential role of expert-labeled examples in training hallucination detectors and provide theoretical support for feedback-based methods, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which have proven critical for reliable LLM deployment.",

    "summary": "This paper demonstrates the feasibility of democratizing AI-driven global weather forecasting models among university research groups by leveraging Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and freely available AI models, such as NVIDIA's FourCastNetv2. FourCastNetv2 is an NVIDIA's advanced neural network for weather prediction and is trained on a 73-channel subset of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset at single levels and different pressure levels. Although the training specifications for FourCastNetv2 are not released to the public, the training documentation of the model's first generation, FourCastNet, is available to all users. The training had 64 A100 GPUs and took 16 hours to complete. Although NVIDIA's models offer significant reductions in both time and cost compared to traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), reproducing published forecasting results presents ongoing challenges for resource-constrained university research groups with limited GPU availability. We demonstrate both (i) leveraging FourCastNetv2 to create predictions through the designated application programming interface (API) and (ii) utilizing NVIDIA hardware to train the original FourCastNet model. Further, this paper demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of NVIDIA A100's for resource-limited research groups in universities. We also explore data management, training efficiency, and model validation, highlighting the advantages and challenges of using limited high-performance computing resources. Consequently, this paper and its corresponding GitHub materials may serve as an initial guide for other university research groups and courses related to machine learning, climate science, and data science to develop research and education programs on AI weather forecasting, and hence help democratize the AI NWP in the digital economy.",

    "summary": "The generation of high-quality synthetic data presents significant challenges in machine learning research, particularly regarding statistical fidelity and uncertainty quantification. Existing generative models produce compelling synthetic samples but lack rigorous statistical guarantees about their relation to the underlying data distribution, limiting their applicability in critical domains requiring robust error bounds. We address this fundamental limitation by presenting a novel framework that incorporates conformal prediction methodologies into Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). By integrating multiple conformal prediction paradigms including Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP), Mondrian Conformal Prediction, Cross-Conformal Prediction, and Venn-Abers Predictors, we establish distribution-free uncertainty quantification in generated samples. This approach, termed Conformalized GAN (cGAN), demonstrates enhanced calibration properties while maintaining the generative power of traditional GANs, producing synthetic data with provable statistical guarantees. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing finite-sample validity guarantees and asymptotic efficiency properties, enabling the reliable application of synthetic data in high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.",

    "summary": "Fairness-aware learning aims to mitigate discrimination against specific protected social groups (e.g., those categorized by gender, ethnicity, age) while minimizing predictive performance loss. Despite efforts to improve fairness in machine learning, prior studies have shown that many models remain unfair when measured against various fairness metrics. In this paper, we examine whether the way training and testing data are sampled affects the reliability of reported fairness metrics. Since training and test sets are often randomly sampled from the same population, bias present in the training data may still exist in the test data, potentially skewing fairness assessments. To address this, we propose FairMatch, a post-processing method that applies propensity score matching to evaluate and mitigate bias. FairMatch identifies control and treatment pairs with similar propensity scores in the test set and adjusts decision thresholds for different subgroups accordingly. For samples that cannot be matched, we perform probabilistic calibration using fairness-aware loss functions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can (a) precisely locate subsets of the test data where the model is unbiased, and (b) significantly reduce bias on the remaining data. Overall, propensity score matching offers a principled way to improve both fairness evaluation and mitigation, without sacrificing predictive performance.",

    "summary": "Language models have emerged as powerful predictors of the viability of biological sequences. During training these models learn the rules of the grammar obeyed by sequences of amino acids or nucleotides. Once trained, these models can take a sequence as input and produce a likelihood score as an output; a higher likelihood implies adherence to the learned grammar and correlates with experimental fitness measurements. Here we show that in-context learning can distort the relationship between fitness and likelihood scores of sequences. This phenomenon most prominently manifests as anomalously high likelihood scores for sequences that contain repeated motifs. We use protein language models with different architectures trained on the masked language modeling objective for our experiments, and find transformer-based models to be particularly vulnerable to this effect. This behavior is mediated by a look-up operation where the model seeks the identity of the masked position by using the other copy of the repeated motif as a reference. This retrieval behavior can override the model's learned priors. This phenomenon persists for imperfectly repeated sequences, and extends to other kinds of biologically relevant features such as reversed complement motifs in RNA sequences that fold into hairpin structures.",

    "summary": "Antenna arrays are widely used in wireless communication, radar systems, radio astronomy, and military defense to enhance signal strength, directivity, and interference suppression. We introduce a deep learning-based optimization approach that enhances the design of sparse phased arrays by reducing grating lobes. This approach begins by generating sparse array configurations to address the non-convex challenges and extensive degrees of freedom inherent in array design. We use neural networks to approximate the non-convex cost function that estimates the energy ratio between the main and side lobes. This differentiable approximation facilitates cost function minimization through gradient descent, optimizing the antenna elements' coordinates and leading to an improved layout. Additionally, we incorporate a tailored penalty mechanism that includes various physical and design constraints into the optimization process, enhancing its robustness and practical applicability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to the ten array configurations with the lowest initial costs, achieving further cost reductions ranging from 411% to 643%, with an impressive average improvement of 552%. By significantly reducing side lobe levels in antenna arrays, this breakthrough paves the way for ultra-precise beamforming, enhanced interference mitigation, and next-generation wireless and radar systems with unprecedented efficiency and clarity.",

Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem, which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence, and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal, we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer, while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current operational state-of-the-art.",

We apply the model to predict the daily closing prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum based on historical data that include past prices, trading volumes, and the Fear and Greed index.

The performance of the model is assessed using several metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), along with statistical validation through the nonparametric Friedman test followed by a post hoc Wilcoxon signed rank test. The results demonstrate that our hybrid model consistently achieves superior accuracy, highlighting its effectiveness for financial prediction tasks.

Specifically, we validate that OUI can effectively guide the selection of the Weight Decay (WD) hyperparameter by indicating whether a model is overfitting or underfitting during training without requiring validation data. Through experiments on DenseNet-BC-100 with CIFAR- 100, EfficientNet-B0 with TinyImageNet and ResNet-34 with ImageNet-1K, we show that maintaining OUI within a prescribed interval correlates strongly with improved generalization and validation scores. Notably, OUI converges significantly faster than traditional metrics such as loss or accuracy, enabling practitioners to identify optimal WD (hyperparameter) values within the early stages of training. By leveraging OUI as a reliable indicator, we can determine early in training whether the chosen WD value leads the model to underfit the training data, overfit, or strike a well-balanced trade-off that maximizes validation scores. This enables more precise WD tuning for optimal performance on the tested datasets and DNNs. All code for reproducing these experiments is available at this https URL.",

Traffic speed data is often incomplete due to sensor failures, data transmission delays, or occlusions, resulting in missing speed data in certain road segments. Currently, tensor decomposition based methods are extensively utilized, they mostly rely on the $L_2$-norm to construct their learning objectives, which leads to reduced robustness in the algorithms. To address this, we propose Temporal-Aware Traffic Speed Imputation (TATSI), which combines the $L_2$-norm and smooth $L_1$ (${SL}_1$)-norm in its loss function, thereby achieving both high accuracy and robust performance in imputing missing time-varying traffic speed data. TATSI adopts a single latent factor-dependent, nonnegative, and multiplicative update (SLF-NMU) approach, which serves as an efficient solver for performing nonnegative latent factor analysis (LFA) on a tensor. Empirical studies on three real-world time-varying traffic speed datasets demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art traffic speed predictors, TATSI more precisely captures temporal patterns, thereby yielding the most accurate imputations for missing traffic speed data.",

Although adversarial training has been an established technique for enhancing robustness in predictive models, it has been overlooked for generative models due to concerns about potential fidelity degradation by the nature of trade-offs between performance and robustness. In this work, we challenge this presumption, introducing Smooth Robust Latent VAE (SRL-VAE), a novel adversarial training framework that boosts both generation quality and robustness. In contrast to conventional adversarial training, which focuses on robustness only, our approach smooths the latent space via adversarial perturbations, promoting more generalizable representations while regularizing with originality representation to sustain original fidelity. Applied as a post-training step on pre-trained VAEs, SRL-VAE improves image robustness and fidelity with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show that SRL-VAE improves both generation quality, in image reconstruction and text-guided image editing, and robustness, against Nightshade attacks and image editing attacks. These results establish a new paradigm, showing that adversarial training, once thought to be detrimental to generative models, can instead enhance both fidelity and robustness.",

    "summary": "Grokking is proposed and widely studied as an intricate phenomenon in which generalization is achieved after a long-lasting period of overfitting. In this work, we propose NeuralGrok, a novel gradient-based approach that learns an optimal gradient transformation to accelerate the generalization of transformers in arithmetic tasks. Specifically, NeuralGrok trains an auxiliary module (e.g., an MLP block) in conjunction with the base model. This module dynamically modulates the influence of individual gradient components based on their contribution to generalization, guided by a bilevel optimization algorithm. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralGrok significantly accelerates generalization, particularly in challenging arithmetic tasks. We also show that NeuralGrok promotes a more stable training paradigm, constantly reducing the model's complexity, while traditional regularization methods, such as weight decay, can introduce substantial instability and impede generalization. We further investigate the intrinsic model complexity leveraging a novel Absolute Gradient Entropy (AGE) metric, which explains that NeuralGrok effectively facilitates generalization by reducing the model complexity. We offer valuable insights on the grokking phenomenon of Transformer models, which encourages a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles governing generalization ability.",

In this work, we study the generalization of the uniform downsampling layer for group equivariant architectures, e.g., G-CNNs. That is, we aim to downsample signals (feature maps) on general finite groups with anti-aliasing. This involves the following: (a) Given a finite group and a downsampling rate, we present an algorithm to form a suitable choice of subgroup. (b) Given a group and a subgroup, we study the notion of bandlimited-ness and propose how to perform anti-aliasing. Notably, our method generalizes the notion of downsampling based on classical sampling theory. When the signal is on a cyclic group, i.e., periodic, our method recovers the standard downsampling of an ideal low-pass filter followed by a subsampling operation. Finally, we conducted experiments on image classification tasks demonstrating that the proposed downsampling operation improves accuracy, better preserves equivariance, and reduces model size when incorporated into G-equivariant networks",

Unlike conventional generative models that rely on large-scale training and implicit neural representations to learn cross-modal mappings, often at high computational cost and with limited flexibility, our framework introduces an explicit symbolic representation comprising three core primitives: functions, parameters, and topological logic. Leveraging a pre-trained language model, our inference engine maps natural language instructions directly to symbolic workflows in a training-free manner. Our framework successfully performs over 12 diverse multimodal generative tasks, demonstrating strong performance and flexibility without the need for task-specific tuning. Experiments show that our method not only matches or outperforms existing state-of-the-art unified models in content quality, but also offers greater efficiency, editability, and interruptibility. We believe that symbolic task representations provide a cost-effective and extensible foundation for advancing the capabilities of generative AI.",

Leveraging this insight, we show that consistent recovery of the latent positions is achievable by appropriately adjusting the statistical inference procedure for the privatized graph. Furthermore, we prove that our procedure is nearly minimax-optimal under local edge differential privacy constraints.

However, GNNs still encounter the challenge of structural imbalance. Prior solutions to this problem did not take graph heterophily into account, namely that connected nodes process distinct labels or features, thus resulting in a deficiency in effectiveness. Upon verifying the impact of heterophily on solving the structural imbalance problem, we propose to rectify the heterophily first and then transfer homophilic knowledge. To the end, we devise a method named HeRB (Heterophily-Resolved Structure Balancer) for GNNs. HeRB consists of two innovative components: 1) A heterophily-lessening augmentation module which serves to reduce inter-class edges and increase intra-class edges; 2) A homophilic knowledge transfer mechanism to convey homophilic information from head nodes to tail nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that HeRB achieves superior performance on two homophilic and six heterophilic benchmark datasets, and the ablation studies further validate the efficacy of two proposed components.",

    "summary": "Ordering a minimal subset of lab tests for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) can be challenging. Care teams must balance between ensuring the availability of the right information and reducing the clinical burden and costs associated with each lab test order. Most in-patient settings experience frequent over-ordering of lab tests, but are now aiming to reduce this burden on both hospital resources and the environment. This paper develops a novel method that combines off-policy learning with privileged information to identify the optimal set of ICU lab tests to order. Our approach, EXplainable Off-policy learning with Side Information for ICU blood Test Orders (ExOSITO) creates an interpretable assistive tool for clinicians to order lab tests by considering both the observed and predicted future status of each patient. We pose this problem as a causal bandit trained using offline data and a reward function derived from clinically-approved rules; we introduce a novel learning framework that integrates clinical knowledge with observational data to bridge the gap between the optimal and logging policies. The learned policy function provides interpretable clinical information and reduces costs without omitting any vital lab orders, outperforming both a physician's policy and prior approaches to this practical problem.",

    "summary": "Backdoor attacks on text classifiers can cause them to predict a predefined label when a particular \"trigger\" is present. Prior attacks often rely on triggers that are ungrammatical or otherwise unusual, leading to conspicuous attacks. As a result, human annotators, who play a critical role in curating training data in practice, can easily detect and filter out these unnatural texts during manual inspection, reducing the risk of such attacks. We argue that a key criterion for a successful attack is for text with and without triggers to be indistinguishable to humans. However, prior work neither directly nor comprehensively evaluated attack subtlety and invisibility with human involvement. We bridge the gap by conducting thorough human evaluations to assess attack subtlety. We also propose \\emph{AttrBkd}, consisting of three recipes for crafting subtle yet effective trigger attributes, such as extracting fine-grained attributes from existing baseline backdoor attacks. Our human evaluations find that AttrBkd with these baseline-derived attributes is often more effective (higher attack success rate) and more subtle (fewer instances detected by humans) than the original baseline backdoor attacks, demonstrating that backdoor attacks can bypass detection by being inconspicuous and appearing natural even upon close inspection, while still remaining effective. Our human annotation also provides information not captured by automated metrics used in prior work, and demonstrates the misalignment of these metrics with human judgment.",

Existing research attributes this issue to group imbalance and addresses it by maximizing group-balanced or worst-group accuracy, which heavily relies on expensive bias annotations. A compromise approach involves predicting bias information using extensively pretrained foundation models, which requires large-scale data and becomes impractical for resource-limited rare domains. To address these challenges, we offer a novel perspective by reframing the spurious correlations as imbalances or mismatches in class-conditional distributions, and propose a simple yet effective robust learning method that eliminates the need for both bias annotations and predictions. With the goal of reducing the mutual information between spurious factors and label information, our method leverages a sample reweighting strategy to achieve class-conditional distribution balancing, which automatically highlights minority groups and classes, effectively dismantling spurious correlations and producing a debiased data distribution for classification. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that our approach consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance, rivaling methods that rely on bias supervision.",

    "summary": "In social learning, a network of agents assigns probability scores (beliefs) to some hypotheses of interest, which rule the generation of local streaming data observed by each agent. Belief formation takes place by means of an iterative two-step procedure where: i) the agents update locally their beliefs by using some likelihood model; and ii) the updated beliefs are combined with the beliefs of the neighboring agents, using a pooling rule. This procedure can fail to perform well in the presence of dynamic drifts, leading the agents to incorrect decision making. Here, we focus on the fully online setting where both the true hypothesis and the likelihood models can change over time. We propose the doubly adaptive social learning ($\\text{A}^2\\text{SL}$) strategy, which infuses social learning with the necessary adaptation capabilities. This goal is achieved by exploiting two adaptation stages: i) a stochastic gradient descent update to learn and track the drifts in the decision model; ii) and an adaptive belief update to track the true hypothesis changing over time. These stages are controlled by two adaptation parameters that govern the evolution of the error probability for each agent. We show that all agents learn consistently for sufficiently small adaptation parameters, in the sense that they ultimately place all their belief mass on the true hypothesis. In particular, the probability of choosing the wrong hypothesis converges to values on the order of the adaptation parameters. The theoretical analysis is illustrated both on synthetic data and by applying the $\\text{A}^2\\text{SL}$ strategy to a social learning problem in the online setting using real data.",

Yet, existing FAL methods fail to account for the heterogeneity of data distribution across clients and the associated fluctuations in global and local model parameters, adversely affecting model accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose CHASe (Client Heterogeneity-Aware Data Selection), specifically designed for FAL. CHASe focuses on identifying those unlabeled samples with high epistemic variations (EVs), which notably oscillate around the decision boundaries during training. To achieve both effectiveness and efficiency, \\model{} encompasses techniques for 1) tracking EVs by analyzing inference inconsistencies across training epochs, 2) calibrating decision boundaries of inaccurate models with a new alignment loss, and 3) enhancing data selection efficiency via a data freeze and awaken mechanism with subset sampling.

    "summary": "The significant computational demands of pretrained language models (PLMs), which often require dedicated hardware, present a substantial challenge in serving them efficiently, especially in multi-tenant environments. To address this, we introduce HMI, a Hierarchical knowledge management-based Multi-tenant Inference system, designed to manage tenants with distinct PLMs resource-efficiently. Our approach is three-fold: Firstly, we categorize PLM knowledge into general, domain-specific, and task-specific. Leveraging insights on knowledge acquisition across different model layers, we construct hierarchical PLMs (hPLMs) by extracting and storing knowledge at different levels, significantly reducing GPU memory usage per tenant. Secondly, we establish hierarchical knowledge management for hPLMs generated by various tenants in HMI. We manage domain-specific knowledge with acceptable storage increases by constructing and updating domain-specific knowledge trees based on frequency. We manage task-specific knowledge within limited GPU memory through parameter swapping. Finally, we propose system optimizations to enhance resource utilization and inference throughput. These include fine-grained pipelining via hierarchical knowledge prefetching to overlap CPU and I/O operations with GPU computations, and optimizing parallel implementations with batched matrix multiplications. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HMI can efficiently serve up to 10,000 hPLMs (hBERTs and hGPTs) on a single GPU, with only a negligible compromise in accuracy.",

    "summary": "Climate change increases the frequency of extreme rainfall, placing a significant strain on urban infrastructures, especially Combined Sewer Systems (CSS). Overflows from overburdened CSS release untreated wastewater into surface waters, posing environmental and public health risks. Although traditional physics-based models are effective, they are costly to maintain and difficult to adapt to evolving system dynamics. Machine Learning (ML) approaches offer cost-efficient alternatives with greater adaptability. To systematically assess the potential of ML for modeling urban infrastructure systems, we propose a protocol for evaluating Neural Network architectures for CSS time series forecasting with respect to predictive performance, model complexity, and robustness to perturbations. In addition, we assess model performance on peak events and critical fluctuations, as these are the key regimes for urban wastewater management. To investigate the feasibility of lightweight models suitable for IoT deployment, we compare global models, which have access to all information, with local models, which rely solely on nearby sensor readings. Additionally, to explore the security risks posed by network outages or adversarial attacks on urban infrastructure, we introduce error models that assess the resilience of models. Our results demonstrate that while global models achieve higher predictive performance, local models provide sufficient resilience in decentralized scenarios, ensuring robust modeling of urban infrastructure. Furthermore, models with longer native forecast horizons exhibit greater robustness to data perturbations. These findings contribute to the development of interpretable and reliable ML solutions for sustainable urban wastewater management. The implementation is available in our GitHub repository.",

    "summary": "Gossip Learning (GL) is a decentralized learning paradigm where users iteratively exchange and aggregate models with a small set of neighboring peers. Recent GL approaches rely on dynamic communication graphs built and maintained using Random Peer Sampling (RPS) protocols. Thanks to graph dynamics, GL can achieve fast convergence even over extremely sparse topologies. However, the robustness of GL over dy- namic graphs to Byzantine (model poisoning) attacks remains unaddressed especially when Byzantine nodes attack the RPS protocol to scale up model poisoning. We address this issue by introducing GRANITE, a framework for robust learning over sparse, dynamic graphs in the presence of a fraction of Byzantine nodes. GRANITE relies on two key components (i) a History-aware Byzantine-resilient Peer Sampling protocol (HaPS), which tracks previously encountered identifiers to reduce adversarial influence over time, and (ii) an Adaptive Probabilistic Threshold (APT), which leverages an estimate of Byzantine presence to set aggregation thresholds with formal guarantees. Empirical results confirm that GRANITE maintains convergence with up to 30% Byzantine nodes, improves learning speed via adaptive filtering of poisoned models and obtains these results in up to 9 times sparser graphs than dictated by current theory.",

    "summary": "Virtual screening plays a critical role in modern drug discovery by enabling the identification of promising candidate molecules for experimental validation. Traditional machine learning methods such as support vector machines (SVM) and XGBoost rely on predefined molecular representations, often leading to information loss and potential bias. In contrast, deep learning approaches-particularly Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)-offer a more expressive and unbiased alternative by operating directly on molecular graphs. Meanwhile, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in drug design, thanks to their capacity to capture complex chemical patterns from large-scale data via attention mechanisms.\nIn this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that integrates GCNs with LLM-derived embeddings to combine localized structural learning with global chemical knowledge. The LLM embeddings can be precomputed and stored in a molecular feature library, removing the need to rerun the LLM during training or inference and thus maintaining computational efficiency. We found that concatenating the LLM embeddings after each GCN layer-rather than only at the final layer-significantly improves performance, enabling deeper integration of global context throughout the network. The resulting model achieves superior results, with an F1-score of (88.8%), outperforming standalone GCN (87.9%), XGBoost (85.5%), and SVM (85.4%) baselines.",

By reducing minimal RCs to a single tunable nonlinearity parameter, we explore how the predictive performance varies with the degree of nonlinearity in the reservoir. To provide controlled testbeds, we generalize to the fractional Halvorsen system, a novel chaotic system with fractional exponents. Our experiments reveal that the prediction performance is maximized when the reservoir's nonlinearity matches the nonlinearity present in the data. In cases where multiple nonlinearities are present in the data, we find that the correlation dimension of the predicted signal is reconstructed correctly when the smallest nonlinearity is matched. We use this observation to propose a method for estimating the minimal nonlinearity in unknown time series by sweeping the reservoir exponent and identifying the transition to a successful reconstruction. Applying this method to both synthetic and real-world datasets, including financial time series, we demonstrate its practical viability. Finally, we transfer these insights to classical RC by augmenting traditional architectures with fractional, generalized reservoir states. This yields performance gains, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios such as physical reservoirs, where increasing reservoir size is impractical or economically unviable. Our work provides a principled route toward tailoring RCs to the intrinsic complexity of the systems they aim to model.",

The local model is learned by updating and fusing the personalized binary masks while the real-valued parameters are fixed among different agents. To further reduce the complexity of hardware implementation, we incorporate a group sparse regularization term in the loss function, enabling the learned local model to achieve structured sparsity. Then, a binary mask aggregation algorithm is designed by introducing an intermediate aggregation tensor and adding a personalized fine-tuning step in each iteration, which constrains model updates towards the local data distribution. The proposed method effectively leverages the relativity among agents while meeting personalized requirements in heterogeneous node conditions. We also provide a theoretical proof for the DSLTH, establishing it as the foundation of the proposed method. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of the DSLTH and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

    "summary": "Future networks (including 6G) are poised to accelerate the realisation of Internet of Everything. However, it will result in a high demand for computing resources to support new services. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising solution, enabling to offload computation-intensive tasks to nearby edge servers from the end-user devices, thereby reducing latency and energy consumption. However, relying solely on a single MEC server for task offloading can lead to uneven resource utilisation and suboptimal performance in complex scenarios. Additionally, traditional task offloading strategies specialise in centralised policy decisions, which unavoidably entail extreme transmission latency and reach computational bottleneck. To fill the gaps, we propose a latency and energy efficient Cooperative Task Offloading framework with Transformer-driven Prediction (CTO-TP), leveraging asynchronous multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to address these challenges. This approach fosters edge-edge cooperation and decreases the synchronous waiting time by performing asynchronous training, optimising task offloading, and resource allocation across distributed networks. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed CTO-TP algorithm reduces up to 80% overall system latency and 87% energy consumption compared to the baseline schemes.",

Prior works have proposed various methods to mitigate this statistical heterogeneity. While these works can achieve good theoretical performance, in this work we provide the first investigation into a hidden over-correction phenomenon brought by the uniform model correction coefficients across clients adopted by existing methods. Such over-correction could degrade model performance and even cause failures in model convergence. To address this, we propose TACO, a novel algorithm that addresses the non-IID nature of clients' data by implementing fine-grained, client-specific gradient correction and model aggregation, steering local models towards a more accurate global optimum. Moreover, we verify that leading FL algorithms generally have better model accuracy in terms of communication rounds rather than wall-clock time, resulting from their extra computation overhead imposed on clients. To enhance the training efficiency, TACO deploys a lightweight model correction and tailored aggregation approach that requires minimum computation overhead and no extra information beyond the synchronized model parameters. To validate TACO's effectiveness, we present the first FL convergence analysis that reveals the root cause of over-correction. Extensive experiments across various datasets confirm TACO's superior and stable performance in practice.",

This study evaluates machine and deep learning methods that relax these constraints, comparing their performance with penalized Cox models on a benchmark of three synthetic and three real datasets. In total, eight different models were tested, including six non-linear models of which four were also non-PH. Although Cox regression often yielded satisfactory performance, we showed the conditions under which machine and deep learning models can perform better. Indeed, the performance of these methods has often been underestimated due to the improper use of Harrell's concordance index (C-index) instead of more appropriate scores such as Antolini's concordance index, which generalizes C-index in cases where the PH assumption does not hold. In addition, since occasionally high C-index models happen to be badly calibrated, combining Antolini's C-index with Brier's score is useful to assess the overall performance of a survival method. Results on our benchmark data showed that survival prediction should be approached by testing different methods to select the most appropriate one according to sample size, non-linearity and non-PH conditions.

These AI kernels follow well-defined data-flow patterns, such as moving tiles between DRAM and SRAM and performing a sequence of computations on those tiles. However, writing high-performance kernels remains complex despite the clarity of these patterns. Achieving peak performance requires careful, hardware-centric optimizations to fully leverage modern accelerators. While domain-specific compilers attempt to reduce the burden of writing high-performance kernels, they often struggle with usability and expressiveness gaps. In this paper, we present TileLang, a generalized tiled programming model for more efficient AI Kernel programming. TileLang decouples scheduling space (thread binding, layout, tensorize and pipeline) from dataflow, and encapsulated them as a set of customization annotations and primitives. This approach allows users to focus on the kernel's data-flow itself, while leaving most other optimizations to compilers. We conduct comprehensive experiments on commonly-used devices, across numerous experiments, our evaluation shows that TileLang can achieve state-of-the-art performance in key kernels, demonstrating that its unified block-and-thread paradigm and transparent scheduling capabilities deliver both the power and flexibility demanded by modern AI system development.",

    "summary": "Dimensionality reduction techniques are fundamental for analyzing and visualizing high-dimensional data. With established methods like t-SNE and PCA presenting a trade-off between representational power and interpretability. This paper introduces a novel approach that bridges this gap by combining the interpretability of linear methods with the expressiveness of non-linear transformations. The proposed algorithm constructs a non-linear mapping between high-dimensional and low-dimensional spaces through a combination of linear transformations, each weighted by Gaussian functions. This architecture enables complex non-linear transformations while preserving the interpretability advantages of linear methods, as each transformation can be analyzed independently. The resulting model provides both powerful dimensionality reduction and transparent insights into the transformed space. Techniques for interpreting the learned transformations are presented, including methods for identifying suppressed dimensions and how space is expanded and contracted. These tools enable practitioners to understand how the algorithm preserves and modifies geometric relationships during dimensionality reduction. To ensure the practical utility of this algorithm, the creation of user-friendly software packages is emphasized, facilitating its adoption in both academia and industry.",

    "summary": "Synthetic Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series generation is crucial for advancing clinical machine learning models, as it helps address data scarcity by providing more training data. However, most existing approaches focus primarily on replicating statistical distributions and temporal dependencies of real-world data. We argue that fidelity to observed data alone does not guarantee better model performance, as common patterns may dominate, limiting the representation of rare but important conditions. This highlights the need for generate synthetic samples to improve performance of specific clinical models to fulfill their target outcomes. To address this, we propose TarDiff, a novel target-oriented diffusion framework that integrates task-specific influence guidance into the synthetic data generation process. Unlike conventional approaches that mimic training data distributions, TarDiff optimizes synthetic samples by quantifying their expected contribution to improving downstream model performance through influence functions. Specifically, we measure the reduction in task-specific loss induced by synthetic samples and embed this influence gradient into the reverse diffusion process, thereby steering the generation towards utility-optimized data. Evaluated on six publicly available EHR datasets, TarDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by up to 20.4% in AUPRC and 18.4% in AUROC. Our results demonstrate that TarDiff not only preserves temporal fidelity but also enhances downstream model performance, offering a robust solution to data scarcity and class imbalance in healthcare analytics.",

    "summary": "Time series classification (TSC) is a critical task with applications in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Due to privacy concerns and data regulations, Federated Learning has emerged as a promising approach for learning from distributed time series data without centralizing raw information. However, most FL solutions rely on a client-server architecture, which introduces robustness and confidentiality risks related to the distinguished role of the server, which is a single point of failure and can observe knowledge extracted from clients. To address these challenges, we propose DROCKS, a fully decentralized FL framework for TSC that leverages ROCKET (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) features. In DROCKS, the global model is trained by sequentially traversing a structured path across federation nodes, where each node refines the model and selects the most effective local kernels before passing them to the successor. Extensive experiments on the UCR archive demonstrate that DROCKS outperforms state-of-the-art client-server FL approaches while being more resilient to node failures and malicious attacks.

We have previously proposed generalization criteria that rely on the observation that Hessian eigenvalue spectral density (HESD) behaves similarly for a wide class of NNs. This paper further studies their applicability by investigating factors that can result in different types of HESD. We conduct a wide range of experiments showing that HESD mainly has positive eigenvalues (MP-HESD) for NN training and fine-tuning with various optimizers on different datasets with different preprocessing and augmentation procedures. We also show that mainly negative HESD (MN-HESD) is a consequence of external gradient manipulation, indicating that the previously proposed Hessian analysis methodology cannot be applied in such cases. We also propose criteria and corresponding conditions to determine HESD type and estimate NN generalization potential. These HESD types and previously proposed generalization criteria are combined into a unified HESD analysis methodology. Finally, we discuss how HESD changes during training, and show the occurrence of quasi-singular (QS) HESD and its influence on the proposed methodology and on the conventional assumptions about the relation between Hessian eigenvalues and NN loss landscape curvature.",

    "summary": "Dynamic node classification is critical for modeling evolving systems like financial transactions and academic collaborations. In such systems, dynamically capturing node information changes is critical for dynamic node classification, which usually requires all labels at every timestamp. However, it is difficult to collect all dynamic labels in real-world scenarios due to high annotation costs and label uncertainty (e.g., ambiguous or delayed labels in fraud detection). In contrast, final timestamp labels are easier to obtain as they rely on complete temporal patterns and are usually maintained as a unique label for each user in many open platforms, without tracking the history data. To bridge this gap, we propose PTCL(Pseudo-label Temporal Curriculum Learning), a pioneering method addressing label-limited dynamic node classification where only final labels are available. PTCL introduces: (1) a temporal decoupling architecture separating the backbone (learning time-aware representations) and decoder (strictly aligned with final labels), which generate pseudo-labels, and (2) a Temporal Curriculum Learning strategy that prioritizes pseudo-labels closer to the final timestamp by assigning them higher weights using an exponentially decaying function. We contribute a new academic dataset (CoOAG), capturing long-range research interest in dynamic graph. Experiments across real-world scenarios demonstrate PTCL's consistent superiority over other methods adapted to this task. Beyond methodology, we propose a unified framework FLiD (Framework for Label-Limited Dynamic Node Classification), consisting of a complete preparation workflow, training pipeline, and evaluation standards, and supporting various models and datasets.

    "summary": "This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of conformal prediction methods on a challenging aerial image dataset featuring diverse events in unconstrained environments. Conformal prediction is a powerful post-hoc technique that takes the output of any classifier and transforms it into a set of likely labels, providing a statistical guarantee on the coverage of the true label. Unlike evaluations on standard benchmarks, our study addresses the complexities of data-scarce and highly variable real-world settings. We investigate the effectiveness of leveraging pretrained models (MobileNet, DenseNet, and ResNet), fine-tuned with limited labeled data, to generate informative prediction sets. To further evaluate the impact of calibration, we consider two parallel pipelines (with and without temperature scaling) and assess performance using two key metrics: empirical coverage and average prediction set size. This setup allows us to systematically examine how calibration choices influence the trade-off between reliability and efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that even with relatively small labeled samples and simple nonconformity scores, conformal prediction can yield valuable uncertainty estimates for complex tasks. Moreover, our analysis reveals that while temperature scaling is often employed for calibration, it does not consistently lead to smaller prediction sets, underscoring the importance of careful consideration in its application. Furthermore, our results highlight the significant potential of model compression techniques within the conformal prediction pipeline for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Based on our observations, we advocate for future research to delve into the impact of noisy or ambiguous labels on conformal prediction performance and to explore effective model reduction strategies.",

A key goal for SBI is to achieve accurate inference with as few simulations as possible, especially for expensive simulators. In this work, we address this challenge by repurposing recent probabilistic foundation models for tabular data: We show how tabular foundation models -- specifically TabPFN -- can be used as pre-trained autoregressive conditional density estimators for SBI. We propose Neural Posterior Estimation with Prior-data Fitted Networks (NPE-PF) and show that it is competitive with current SBI approaches in terms of accuracy for both benchmark tasks and two complex scientific inverse problems. Crucially, it often substantially outperforms them in terms of simulation efficiency, sometimes requiring orders of magnitude fewer simulations. NPE-PF eliminates the need for inference network selection, training, and hyperparameter tuning. We also show that it exhibits superior robustness to model misspecification and can be scaled to simulation budgets that exceed the context size limit of TabPFN. NPE-PF provides a new direction for SBI, where training-free, general-purpose inference models offer efficient, easy-to-use, and flexible solutions for a wide range of stochastic inverse problems.",

Machine learning models trained on wind turbine operation data are commonly used to detect anomalies and, eventually, operation faults. However, data-driven normal behavior models (NBMs) require a substantial amount of training data, as NBMs trained with scarce data may result in unreliable fault diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel generative deep learning approach to make SCADA samples from one wind turbine lacking training data resemble SCADA data from wind turbines with representative training data. Through CycleGAN-based domain mapping, our method enables the application of an NBM trained on an existing wind turbine to one with severely limited data. We demonstrate our approach on field data mapping SCADA samples across 7 substantially different WTs. Our findings show significantly improved fault diagnosis in wind turbines with scarce data. Our method achieves the most similar anomaly scores to an NBM trained with abundant data, outperforming NBMs trained on scarce training data with improvements of +10.3% in F1-score when 1 month of training data is available and +16.8% when 2 weeks are available. The domain mapping approach outperforms conventional fine-tuning at all considered degrees of data scarcity, ranging from 1 to 8 weeks of training data. The proposed technique enables earlier and more reliable fault diagnosis in newly installed wind farms, demonstrating a novel and promising research direction to improve anomaly detection when faced with training data scarcity.",

This study proposes an interpretable Machine Learning (ML) framework for MDR prediction, aiming for both accurate inference and enhanced explainability.\nMethods: Patients are modeled as Multivariate Time Series (MTS), capturing clinical progression and patient-to-patient interactions. Similarity among patients is quantified using MTS-based methods: descriptive statistics, Dynamic Time Warping, and Time Cluster Kernel. These similarity measures serve as inputs for MDR classification via Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, with dimensionality reduction and kernel transformations improving model performance. For explainability, patient similarity networks are constructed from these metrics. Spectral clustering and t-SNE are applied to identify MDR-related subgroups and visualize high-risk clusters, enabling insight into clinically relevant patterns.\nResults: The framework was validated on ICU Electronic Health Records from the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada, achieving an AUC of 81%. It outperforms baseline ML and deep learning models by leveraging graph-based patient similarity. The approach identifies key risk factors -- prolonged antibiotic use, invasive procedures, co-infections, and extended ICU stays -- and reveals clinically meaningful clusters.

    "summary": "In industrial settings, surface defects on steel can significantly compromise its service life and elevate potential safety risks. Traditional defect detection methods predominantly rely on manual inspection, which suffers from low efficiency and high costs. Although automated defect detection approaches based on Convolutional Neural Networks(e.g., Mask R-CNN) have advanced rapidly, their reliability remains challenged due to data annotation uncertainties during deep model training and overfitting issues. These limitations may lead to detection deviations when processing the given new test samples, rendering automated detection processes unreliable. To address this challenge, we first evaluate the detection model's practical performance through calibration data that satisfies the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) condition with test data. Specifically, we define a loss function for each calibration sample to quantify detection error rates, such as the complement of recall rate and false discovery rate. Subsequently, we derive a statistically rigorous threshold based on a user-defined risk level to identify high-probability defective pixels in test images, thereby constructing prediction sets (e.g., defect regions). This methodology ensures that the expected error rate (mean error rate) on the test set remains strictly bounced by the predefined risk level. Additionally, we observe a negative correlation between the average prediction set size and the risk level on the test set, establishing a statistically rigorous metric for assessing detection model uncertainty. Furthermore, our study demonstrates robust and efficient control over the expected test set error rate across varying calibration-to-test partitioning ratios, validating the method's adaptability and operational effectiveness.",

By comparing RoMA's estimates to those of formal verification methods, we demonstrate its accuracy with minimal error margins while maintaining computational efficiency.

    "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for various learning tasks, ranging from node classification to link prediction. They have demonstrated excellent performance in multiple domains involving graph-structured data. However, an important category of learning tasks, namely link weight prediction, has received less emphasis due to its increased complexity compared to binary link classification. Link weight prediction becomes even more challenging when considering multilayer networks, where nodes can be interconnected across multiple layers. To address these challenges, we propose a new method named Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network (MSGCN), which spatially embeds information across multiple layers to predict interlayer link weights. The MSGCN model generalizes spatial graph convolution to multiplex networks and captures the geometric structure of nodes across multiple layers. Extensive experiments using data with known interlayer link information show that the MSGCN model has robust, accurate, and generalizable link weight prediction performance across a wide variety of multiplex network structures.",

    "summary": "Modern edge devices, such as cameras, drones, and Internet-of-Things nodes, rely on deep learning to enable a wide range of intelligent applications, including object recognition, environment perception, and autonomous navigation. However, deploying deep learning models directly on the often resource-constrained edge devices demands significant memory footprints and computational power for real-time inference using traditional digital computing architectures. In this paper, we present WISE, a novel computing architecture for wireless edge networks designed to overcome energy constraints in deep learning inference. WISE achieves this goal through two key innovations: disaggregated model access via wireless broadcasting and in-physics computation of general complex-valued matrix-vector multiplications directly at radio frequency. Using a software-defined radio platform with wirelessly broadcast model weights over the air, we demonstrate that WISE achieves 95.7% image classification accuracy with ultra-low operation power of 6.0 fJ/MAC per client, corresponding to a computation efficiency of 165.8 TOPS/W. This approach enables energy-efficient deep learning inference on wirelessly connected edge devices, achieving more than two orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency compared to traditional digital computing.",

While techniques like replay buffers and parameter-efficient tuning (e.g., Low-Rank Adaptation or LoRA) have been proposed, few studies investigate real-time domain adaptation under strict computational and data-stream constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate a lightweight method combining LoRA and a minimal replay mechanism in a realistic streaming setting across three diverse knowledge domains: medical question answering, genetics, and law. Using perplexity, semantic similarity, and GPT-based human-like evaluation metrics, we quantify the model's adaptation, forgetting, and recovery over time. Our experiments reveal that while catastrophic forgetting naturally occurs, even minimal replay significantly stabilizes and partially restores domain-specific knowledge. This study contributes practical insights for deploying adaptable LLMs in resource-constrained, real-world scenarios.",

These assumptions are usually calibrated on the technical characteristics of the units, such as installed capacity or technology type. However, even if power generation units technically can dispatch flexibly, service obligations and market incentives may constrain their operation. Here, we cluster over 60% of German national gas generation (generation units of 100 MWp or above) based on their empirical flexibility. We process the hourly dispatch of sample units between 2019 and 2023 using a novel deep learning approach, that transforms time series into easy-to-cluster representations. We identify two clusters of peaker units and two clusters of non-peaker units, whose different empirical flexibility is quantified by cluster-level ramp rates. Non-peaker units, around half of the sample, are empirically less flexible than peakers, and make up for more than 83% of sample must-run generation. Regulatory changes addressing the low market responsiveness of non-peakers are needed to unlock their flexibility.",

    "summary": "Organizations developing machine learning-based (ML) technologies face the complex challenge of achieving high predictive performance while respecting the law. This intersection between ML and the law creates new complexities. As ML model behavior is inferred from training data, legal obligations cannot be operationalized in source code directly. Rather, legal obligations require \"indirect\" operationalization. However, choosing context-appropriate operationalizations presents two compounding challenges: (1) laws often permit multiple valid operationalizations for a given legal obligation-each with varying degrees of legal adequacy; and, (2) each operationalization creates unpredictable trade-offs among the different legal obligations and with predictive performance. Evaluating these trade-offs requires metrics (or heuristics), which are in turn difficult to validate against legal obligations. Current methodologies fail to fully address these interwoven challenges as they either focus on legal compliance for traditional software or on ML model development without adequately considering legal complexities. In response, we introduce a five-stage interdisciplinary framework that integrates legal and ML-technical analysis during ML model development. This framework facilitates designing ML models in a legally aligned way and identifying high-performing models that are legally justifiable. Legal reasoning guides choices for operationalizations and evaluation metrics, while ML experts ensure technical feasibility, performance optimization and an accurate interpretation of metric values. This framework bridges the gap between more conceptual analysis of law and ML models' need for deterministic specifications. We illustrate its application using a case study in the context of anti-money laundering.",

In this article, we introduce a novel multi-layered hierarchical HITL DRL algorithm that comprises three types of learning: self learning, imitation learning and transfer learning. In addition, we consider three forms of human inputs: reward, action and demonstration. Furthermore, we discuss main challenges, trade-offs and advantages of HITL in solving complex problems and how human information can be integrated in the AI solution systematically. To verify our technical results, we present a real-world unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) problem wherein a number of enemy drones attack a restricted area. The objective is to design a scalable HITL DRL algorithm for ally drones to neutralize the enemy drones before they reach the area. To this end, we first implement our solution using an award-winning open-source HITL software called Cogment. We then demonstrate several interesting results such as (a) HITL leads to faster training and higher performance, (b) advice acts as a guiding direction for gradient methods and lowers variance, and (c) the amount of advice should neither be too large nor too small to avoid over-training and under-training. Finally, we illustrate the role of human-AI cooperation in solving two real-world complex scenarios, i.e., overloaded and decoy attacks.",

In the same vein, they provide an interesting avenue for the exploration of formal verification and mechanistic interpretability. Since the introduction of code-specific models, despite their successes in generating code in Lean4 and Isabelle, the task of generalized theorem proving still remains far from being fully solved and will be a benchmark for reasoning capability in LLMs. In this work, we introduce a framework that generates whole proofs in a formal language to be used within systems that utilize the power of built-in tactics and off-the-shelf automated theorem provers. Our framework includes 3 components: generating natural language statements of the code to be verified, an LLM that generates formal proofs for the given statement, and a module employing heuristics for building the final proof. To train the LLM, we employ a 2-stage fine-tuning process, where we first use SFT-based training to enable the model to generate syntactically correct Isabelle code and then RL-based training that encourages the model to generate proofs verified by a theorem prover. We validate our framework using the miniF2F-test benchmark and the Isabelle proof assistant and design a use case to verify the correctness of the AWS S3 bucket access policy code. We also curate a dataset based on the FVEL\\textsubscript{\\textnormal{ER}} dataset for future training tasks.",

    "summary": "Contraction metrics are crucial in control theory because they provide a powerful framework for analyzing stability, robustness, and convergence of various dynamical systems. However, identifying these metrics for complex nonlinear systems remains an open challenge due to the lack of scalable and effective tools. This paper explores the approach of learning verifiable contraction metrics parametrized as neural networks (NNs) for discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems. While prior works on formal verification of contraction metrics for general nonlinear systems have focused on convex optimization methods (e.g. linear matrix inequalities, etc) under the assumption of continuously differentiable dynamics, the growing prevalence of NN-based controllers, often utilizing ReLU activations, introduces challenges due to the non-smooth nature of the resulting closed-loop dynamics. To bridge this gap, we establish a new sufficient condition for establishing formal neural contraction metrics for general discrete-time nonlinear systems assuming only the continuity of the dynamics. We show that from a computational perspective, our sufficient condition can be efficiently verified using the state-of-the-art neural network verifier $\\alpha,\\!\\beta$-CROWN, which scales up non-convex neural network verification via novel integration of symbolic linear bound propagation and branch-and-bound. Built upon our analysis tool, we further develop a learning method for synthesizing neural contraction metrics from sampled data. Finally, our approach is validated through the successful synthesis and verification of NN contraction metrics for various nonlinear examples.",

While solutions to such linear differential games are typically obtained through coupled Riccati equations, the complexity increases when agents have incomplete information, particularly when neither is aware of the other's cost function. To tackle this challenge, we propose a model-based Peer-Aware Cost Estimation (PACE) framework for learning the cost parameters of the other agent. In PACE, each agent treats its peer as a learning agent rather than a stationary optimal agent, models their learning dynamics, and leverages this dynamic to infer the cost function parameters of the other agent. This approach enables agents to infer each other's objective function in real time based solely on their previous state observations and dynamically adapt their control policies. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of parameter estimation and the stability of system states in PACE. Additionally, in our numerical studies, we demonstrate how modeling the learning dynamics of the other agent benefits PACE, compared to approaches that approximate the other agent as having complete information, particularly in terms of stability and convergence speed.",

While traditional design approaches based on global optimization approaches are effective when dealing with a small number of design parameters, as the complexity of the solution space and of the constraints increases different techniques are needed. This is an important reason that makes the design and optimization of microelectronic components (characterized by large solution space and multiphysics constraints) very challenging for traditional methods. By taking as prototypical elements an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and a heterogeneously integrated (HI) interposer, we develop and numerically test an optimization framework based on reinforcement learning (RL). More specifically, we consider the optimization of the bonded interconnect geometry for an ASIC chip as well as the placement of components on a HI interposer while satisfying thermoelastic and design constraints. This placement problem is particularly interesting because it features a high-dimensional solution space.",

    "summary": "In recent years, Channel State Information (CSI), recognized for its fine-grained spatial characteristics, has attracted increasing attention in WiFi-based indoor localization. However, despite its potential, CSI-based approaches have yet to achieve the same level of deployment scale and commercialization as those based on Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). A key limitation lies in the fact that most existing CSI-based systems are developed and evaluated in controlled, small-scale environments, limiting their generalizability. To bridge this gap, we explore the deployment of a large-scale CSI-based localization system involving over 400 Access Points (APs) in a real-world building under the Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) paradigm. We highlight two critical yet often overlooked factors: the underutilization of unlabeled data and the inherent heterogeneity of CSI measurements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI-based learning framework for WiFi localization, tailored for large-scale ISAC deployments on the server side. Specifically, we employ a novel graph-based structure to model heterogeneous CSI data and reduce redundancy. We further design a pretext pretraining task that incorporates spatial and temporal priors to effectively leverage large-scale unlabeled CSI data. Complementarily, we introduce a confidence-aware fine-tuning strategy to enhance the robustness of localization results. In a leave-one-smartphone-out experiment spanning five floors and 25, 600 m2, we achieve a median localization error of 2.17 meters and a floor accuracy of 99.49%. This performance corresponds to an 18.7% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the best-performing baseline.",

However, the development and application of foundation models in this field are still burgeoning, as there are a variety of competing approaches that each come with significant benefits and drawbacks. This paper examines these approaches along with their roots in the computer vision field in order to characterize potential advantages and pitfalls while outlining future directions to further improve remote sensing-specific foundation models. We discuss the quality of the learned representations and methods to alleviate the need for massive compute resources. We place emphasis on the multi-sensor aspect of Earth observations, and the extent to which existing approaches leverage multiple sensors in training foundation models in relation to multi-modal foundation models. Finally, we identify opportunities for further harnessing the vast amounts of unlabeled, seasonal, and multi-sensor remote sensing observations.",

    "summary": "Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately detect objects and interpret their surroundings. However, even when trained using millions of miles of real-world data, AVs are often unable to detect rare failure modes (RFMs). The problem of RFMs is commonly referred to as the \"long-tail challenge\", due to the distribution of data including many instances that are very rarely seen. In this paper, we present a novel approach that utilizes advanced generative and explainable AI techniques to aid in understanding RFMs. Our methods can be used to enhance the robustness and reliability of AVs when combined with both downstream model training and testing. We extract segmentation masks for objects of interest (e.g., cars) and invert them to create environmental masks. These masks, combined with carefully crafted text prompts, are fed into a custom diffusion model. We leverage the Stable Diffusion inpainting model guided by adversarial noise optimization to generate images containing diverse environments designed to evade object detection models and expose vulnerabilities in AI systems. Finally, we produce natural language descriptions of the generated RFMs that can guide developers and policymakers to improve the safety and reliability of AV systems.",

    "summary": "The demand for high-fidelity test data is paramount in industrial settings where access to production data is largely restricted. Traditional data generation methods often fall short, struggling with low-fidelity and the ability to model complex data structures and semantic relationships that are critical for testing complex SQL code generation services like Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL). In this paper, we address the critical need for generating syntactically correct and semantically ``meaningful'' mock data for complex schema that includes columns with nested structures that we frequently encounter in Google SQL code generation workloads. We highlight the limitations of existing approaches used in production, particularly their inability to handle large and complex schema, as well as the lack of semantically coherent test data that lead to limited test coverage. We demonstrate that by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and incorporating strategic pre- and post-processing steps, we can generate realistic high-fidelity test data that adheres to complex structural constraints and maintains semantic integrity to the test targets (SQL queries/functions). This approach supports comprehensive testing of complex SQL queries involving joins, aggregations, and even deeply nested subqueries, ensuring robust evaluation of SQL code generation services, like NL2SQL and SQL Code Assistant services. Our results demonstrate the practical utility of an out-of-the-box LLM (\\textit{gemini}) based test data generation for industrial SQL code generation services where generating realistic test data is essential due to the frequent unavailability of production datasets.",

Among filter, wrapper, and embedded-based approaches, the reinforcement learning (RL)-based subspace exploration strategy provides a novel objective optimization-directed perspective and promising performance. Nevertheless, even with improved performance, current reinforcement learning approaches face challenges similar to conventional methods when dealing with complex datasets. These challenges stem from the inefficient paradigm of using one agent per feature and the inherent complexities present in the datasets. This observation motivates us to investigate and address the above issue and propose a novel approach, namely HRLFS. Our methodology initially employs a Large Language Model (LLM)-based hybrid state extractor to capture each feature's mathematical and semantic characteristics. Based on this information, features are clustered, facilitating the construction of hierarchical agents for each cluster and sub-cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of our approach. Compared to contemporary or the one-feature-one-agent RL-based approaches, HRLFS improves the downstream ML performance with iterative feature subspace exploration while accelerating total run time by reducing the number of agents involved.",

    "summary": "Finding the initial depth-to-water table (DTWT) configuration of a catchment is a critical challenge when simulating the hydrological cycle with integrated models, significantly impacting simulation outcomes. Traditionally, this involves iterative spin-up computations, where the model runs under constant atmospheric settings until steady-state is achieved. These so-called model spin-ups are computationally expensive, often requiring many years of simulated time, particularly when the initial DTWT configuration is far from steady state.\nTo accelerate the model spin-up process we developed HydroStartML, a machine learning emulator trained on steady-state DTWT configurations across the contiguous United States. HydroStartML predicts, based on available data like conductivity and surface slopes, a DTWT configuration of the respective watershed, which can be used as an initial DTWT.\nOur results show that initializing spin-up computations with HydroStartML predictions leads to faster convergence than with other initial configurations like spatially constant DTWTs. The emulator accurately predicts configurations close to steady state, even for terrain configurations not seen in training, and allows especially significant reductions in computational spin-up effort in regions with deep DTWTs. This work opens the door for hybrid approaches that blend machine learning and traditional simulation, enhancing predictive accuracy and efficiency in hydrology for improving water resource management and understanding complex environmental interactions.",

IRA leverages two key mechanisms: (1) Interest Units that capture diverse user interests as contextual texts, while reinforcing or fading over time through cumulative updates, and (2) a retrieval process that measures the relevance between Interest Units and documents based solely on semantic relationships, eliminating dependence on click signals to mitigate temporal biases. By integrating cumulative Interest Unit updates with the retrieval process, IRA continuously adapts to evolving user preferences, ensuring robust and fine-grained personalization without being constrained by past training distributions. We validate the effectiveness of IRA through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including its deployment in the Home Section of NAVER's CAFE, South Korea's leading community platform.",

    "summary": "In biomedical science, a set of objects or persons can often be described by multiple distinct sets of features obtained from different data sources or modalities (called \"multi-view data\"). Classical machine learning methods ignore the multi-view structure of such data, limiting model interpretability and performance. The R package `mvs` provides methods that were designed specifically for dealing with multi-view data, based on the multi-view stacking (MVS) framework. MVS is a form of supervised (machine) learning used to train multi-view classification or prediction models. MVS works by training a learning algorithm on each view separately, estimating the predictive power of each view-specific model through cross-validation, and then using another learning algorithm to assign weights to the view-specific models based on their estimated predictions. MVS is a form of ensemble learning, dividing the large multi-view learning problem into smaller sub-problems. Most of these sub-problems can be solved in parallel, making it computationally attractive. Additionally, the number of features of the sub-problems is greatly reduced compared with the full multi-view learning problem. This makes MVS especially useful when the total number of features is larger than the number of observations (i.e., high-dimensional data). MVS can still be applied even if the sub-problems are themselves high-dimensional by adding suitable penalty terms to the learning algorithms. Furthermore, MVS can be used to automatically select the views which are most important for prediction. The R package `mvs` makes fitting MVS models, including such penalty terms, easily and openly accessible. `mvs` allows for the fitting of stacked models with any number of levels, with different penalty terms, different outcome distributions, and provides several options for missing data handling.",

In enterprise environments like SAP HANA Cloud systems, this task often involves monitoring high-dimensional, multivariate time series (MTS) derived from telemetry and log data. With the advent of quantum machine learning offering efficient calculations in high-dimensional latent spaces, many avenues open for dealing with such complex data. One approach is the Quantum Autoencoder (QAE), an emerging and promising method with potential for application in both data compression and AD. However, prior applications of QAEs to time series AD have been restricted to univariate data, limiting their relevance for real-world enterprise systems. In this work, we introduce a novel QAE-based framework designed specifically for MTS AD towards enterprise scale. We theoretically develop and experimentally validate the architecture, demonstrating that our QAE achieves performance competitive with neural-network-based autoencoders while requiring fewer trainable parameters. We evaluate our model on datasets that closely reflect SAP system telemetry and show that the proposed QAE is a viable and efficient alternative for semisupervised AD in real-world enterprise settings.",

Previous studies have reported that this technique actually improves the performance of trained models in downstream tasks; however, this improvement has been observed only in specific downstream tasks, without consistent enhancement in average next-token prediction loss. To understand this phenomenon, we closely investigate how prepending metadata during pre-training affects model performance by examining its behavior using artificial data. Interestingly, we found that this approach produces both positive and negative effects on the downstream tasks. We demonstrate that the effectiveness of the approach depends on whether latent semantics can be inferred from the downstream task's prompt. Specifically, through investigations using data generated by probabilistic context-free grammars, we show that training with metadata helps improve model's performance when the given context is long enough to infer the latent semantics. In contrast, the technique negatively impacts performance when the context lacks the necessary information to make an accurate posterior inference.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly require processing long text sequences, but GPU memory limitations force difficult trade-offs between memory capacity and bandwidth. While HBM-based acceleration offers high bandwidth, its capacity remains constrained. Offloading data to host-side DIMMs improves capacity but introduces costly data swapping overhead. We identify that the critical memory bottleneck lies in the decoding phase of multi-head attention (MHA) exclusively, which demands substantial capacity for storing KV caches and high bandwidth for attention computation. Our key insight reveals this operation uniquely aligns with modern DIMM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures, which offers scalability of both capacity and bandwidth.\nBased on this observation and insight, we propose L3, a hardware-software co-designed system integrating DIMM-PIM and GPU devices. L3 introduces three innovations: First, hardware redesigns resolve data layout mismatches and computational element mismatches in DIMM-PIM, enhancing LLM inference utilization. Second, communication optimization enables hiding the data transfer overhead with the computation. Third, an adaptive scheduler coordinates GPU-DIMM-PIM operations to maximize parallelism between devices. Evaluations using real-world traces show L3 achieves up to 6.1$\\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art HBM-PIM solutions while significantly improving batch sizes.",

    "summary": "The demand for realistic virtual immersive audio continues to grow, with Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) playing a key role. HRTFs capture how sound reaches our ears, reflecting unique anatomical features and enhancing spatial perception. It has been shown that personalized HRTFs improve localization accuracy, but their measurement remains time-consuming and requires a noise-free environment. Although machine learning has been shown to reduce the required measurement points and, thus, the measurement time, a controlled environment is still necessary. This paper proposes a method to address this constraint by presenting a novel technique that can upsample sparse, noisy HRTF measurements. The proposed approach combines an HRTF Denoisy U-Net for denoising and an Autoencoding Generative Adversarial Network (AE-GAN) for upsampling from three measurement points. The proposed method achieves a log-spectral distortion (LSD) error of 5.41 dB and a cosine similarity loss of 0.0070, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in HRTF upsampling.",

While convenient for optimization, this choice often leads to likelihood misspecification, resulting in blurry reconstructions and poor data fidelity, especially for high-dimensional data such as images. In this work, we propose \\textit{EnVAE}, a novel likelihood-free generative framework that has a deterministic decoder and employs the energy score -- a proper scoring rule -- to build the reconstruction loss. This enables likelihood-free inference without requiring explicit parametric density functions. To address the computational inefficiency of the energy score, we introduce a fast variant, \\textit{FEnVAE}, based on the local smoothness of the decoder and the sharpness of the posterior distribution of latent variables. This yields an efficient single-sample training objective that integrates seamlessly into existing VAE pipelines with minimal overhead. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that \\textit{EnVAE} achieves superior reconstruction and generation quality compared to likelihood-based baselines. Our framework offers a general, scalable, and statistically principled alternative for flexible and nonparametric distribution learning in generative modeling.",

Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to generate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer connectivity throughout the architecture. Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized molecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar chemical structures. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen effectively generates diverse conformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its performance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. Given these initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level structure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for predicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for their intrinsic structural flexibility.",

While LVLMs excel in multi-modal reasoning, their outputs often exhibit hallucinated content with high confidence, posing risks in safety-critical applications. We propose a model-agnostic uncertainty quantification method that integrates dynamic threshold calibration and cross-modal consistency verification. By partitioning data into calibration and test sets, the framework computes nonconformity scores to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees under user-defined risk levels ($\\alpha$). Key innovations include: (1) rigorous control of \\textbf{marginal coverage} to ensure empirical error rates remain strictly below $\\alpha$; (2) dynamic adjustment of prediction set sizes inversely with $\\alpha$, filtering low-confidence outputs; (3) elimination of prior distribution assumptions and retraining requirements. Evaluations on benchmarks (ScienceQA, MMMU) with eight LVLMs demonstrate that SCP enforces theoretical guarantees across all $\\alpha$ values. The framework achieves stable performance across varying calibration-to-test split ratios, underscoring its robustness for real-world deployment in healthcare, autonomous systems, and other safety-sensitive domains. This work bridges the gap between theoretical reliability and practical applicability in multi-modal AI systems, offering a scalable solution for hallucination detection and uncertainty-aware decision-making.",

We introduce a modeling approach that approximates real-world LLM workflows through a binning strategy for input-output token distributions and batch size variations. Our empirical analysis spans software frameworks, decoding strategies, GPU architectures, online and offline serving settings, and model parallelism configurations. We show that the effectiveness of inference optimizations is highly sensitive to workload geometry, software stack, and hardware accelerators, demonstrating that naive energy estimates based on FLOPs or theoretical GPU utilization significantly underestimate real-world energy consumption. Our findings reveal that the proper application of relevant inference efficiency optimizations can reduce total energy use by up to 73% from unoptimized baselines. These insights provide a foundation for sustainable LLM deployment and inform energy-efficient design strategies for future AI infrastructure.",

A promising countermeasure is adversarial training, where quantum classifiers are trained by using an attack-aware, adversarial loss function. This work establishes novel bounds on the generalization error of adversarially trained quantum classifiers when tested in the presence of perturbation-constrained adversaries. The bounds quantify the excess generalization error incurred to ensure robustness to adversarial attacks as scaling with the training sample size $m$ as $1/\\sqrt{m}$, while yielding insights into the impact of the quantum embedding. For quantum binary classifiers employing \\textit{rotation embedding}, we find that, in the presence of adversarial attacks on classical inputs $\\mathbf{x}$, the increase in sample complexity due to adversarial training over conventional training vanishes in the limit of high dimensional inputs $\\mathbf{x}$. In contrast, when the adversary can directly attack the quantum state $\\rho(\\mathbf{x})$ encoding the input $\\mathbf{x}$, the excess generalization error depends on the choice of embedding only through its Hilbert space dimension. The results are also extended to multi-class classifiers. We validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.",

    "summary": "When a plasma disrupts in a tokamak, significant heat and electromagnetic loads are deposited onto the surrounding device components. These forces scale with plasma current and magnetic field strength, making disruptions one of the key challenges for future devices. Unfortunately, disruptions are not fully understood, with many different underlying causes that are difficult to anticipate. Data-driven models have shown success in predicting them, but they only provide limited interpretability. On the other hand, large-scale statistical analyses have been a great asset to understanding disruptive patterns. In this paper, we leverage data-driven methods to find an interpretable representation of the plasma state for disruption characterization. Specifically, we use a latent variable model to represent diagnostic measurements as a low-dimensional, latent representation. We build upon the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework, and extend it for (1) continuous projections of plasma trajectories; (2) a multimodal structure to separate operating regimes; and (3) separation with respect to disruptive regimes. Subsequently, we can identify continuous indicators for the disruption rate and the disruptivity based on statistical properties of measurement data. The proposed method is demonstrated using a dataset of approximately 1600 TCV discharges, selecting for flat-top disruptions or regular terminations. We evaluate the method with respect to (1) the identified disruption risk and its correlation with other plasma properties; (2) the ability to distinguish different types of disruptions; and (3) downstream analyses. For the latter, we conduct a demonstrative study on identifying parameters connected to disruptions using counterfactual-like analysis. Overall, the method can adequately identify distinct operating regimes characterized by varying proximity to disruptions in an interpretable manner.",

To address this gap, we perform a careful comparison of training-free sparse attention methods at varying model scales, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels on a diverse collection of long-sequence tasks-including novel ones that rely on natural language while remaining controllable and easy to evaluate. Based on our experiments, we report a series of key findings: 1) an isoFLOPS analysis reveals that for very long sequences, larger and highly sparse models are preferable to smaller and dense ones. 2) The level of sparsity attainable while statistically guaranteeing accuracy preservation is higher during decoding than prefilling, and correlates with model size in the former. 3) There is no clear strategy that performs best across tasks and phases, with different units of sparsification or budget adaptivity needed for different scenarios. Even moderate sparsity levels often result in significant performance degradation on at least one task, highlighting that sparse attention is not a universal solution. 4) We introduce and validate novel scaling laws specifically tailored for sparse attention, providing evidence that our findings are likely to hold true beyond our range of experiments. Through these insights, we demonstrate that sparse attention is a key tool to enhance the capabilities of Transformer LLMs for processing longer sequences, but requires careful evaluation of trade-offs for performance-sensitive applications.",

    "summary": "Many economies are challenged by the effects of an ageing population, particularly in sectors where resource capacity planning is critical, such as healthcare. This research addresses the operational challenges of bed and staffing capacity planning in hospital wards by using predictive and prescriptive analytical methods, both individually and in tandem. We applied these methodologies to a study of 165,000 patients across a network of 11 hospitals in the UK. Predictive modelling, specifically Classification and Regression Trees, forecasts patient length of stay based on clinical and demographic data. On the prescriptive side, deterministic and two-stage stochastic optimisation models determine optimal bed and staff planning strategies to minimise costs. Linking the predictive models with the prescriptive optimisation models, generates demand forecasts that inform the optimisation process, providing accurate and practical solutions. The results demonstrate that this integrated approach captures real-world variations in patient LOS and offers a 7% cost saving compared to average-based planning. This approach helps healthcare managers make robust decisions by incorporating patient-specific characteristics, improving capacity allocation, and mitigating risks associated with demand variability. Consequently, this combined methodology can be broadly extended across various sectors facing similar challenges, showcasing the versatility and effectiveness of integrating predictive and prescriptive analytics.",

However, most works focus on camera data, with only a few that leverage lidar data or combine both to better represent autonomous vehicle sensor setups. In addition, raw sensor predictions are less actionable than 3D occupancy predictions, but there are no works examining the effects of combining both multimodal sensor data and 3D occupancy prediction. In this work, we perform a set of experiments with a MUltimodal World Model with Geometric VOxel representations (MUVO) to evaluate different sensor fusion strategies to better understand the effects on sensor data prediction. We also analyze potential weaknesses of current sensor fusion approaches and examine the benefits of additionally predicting 3D occupancy.",

    "summary": "As a key component to intuitive cognition and reasoning solutions in human intelligence, causal knowledge provides great potential for reinforcement learning (RL) agents' interpretability towards decision-making by helping reduce the searching space. However, there is still a considerable gap in discovering and incorporating causality into RL, which hinders the rapid development of causal RL. In this paper, we consider explicitly modeling the generation process of states with the causal graphical model, based on which we augment the policy. We formulate the causal structure updating into the RL interaction process with active intervention learning of the environment. To optimize the derived objective, we propose a framework with theoretical performance guarantees that alternates between two steps: using interventions for causal structure learning during exploration and using the learned causal structure for policy guidance during exploitation. Due to the lack of public benchmarks that allow direct intervention in the state space, we design the root cause localization task in our simulated fault alarm environment and then empirically show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method against state-of-the-art baselines. Theoretical analysis shows that our performance improvement attributes to the virtuous cycle of causal-guided policy learning and causal structure learning, which aligns with our experimental results.

    "summary": "The traditional two-stage approach to causal inference first identifies a single causal model (or equivalence class of models), which is then used to answer causal queries. However, this neglects any epistemic model uncertainty. In contrast, Bayesian causal inference does incorporate epistemic uncertainty into query estimates via Bayesian marginalisation (posterior averaging) over all causal models. While principled, this marginalisation over entire causal models, i.e., both causal structures (graphs) and mechanisms, poses a tremendous computational challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by decomposing structure marginalisation into the marginalisation over (i) causal orders and (ii) directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) given an order. We can marginalise the latter in closed form by limiting the number of parents per variable and utilising Gaussian processes to model mechanisms. To marginalise over orders, we use a sampling-based approximation, for which we devise a novel auto-regressive distribution over causal orders (ARCO). Our method outperforms state-of-the-art in structure learning on simulated non-linear additive noise benchmarks, and yields competitive results on real-world data. Furthermore, we can accurately infer interventional distributions and average causal effects.",

    "summary": "This work addresses flexibility in deep learning by means of transductive reasoning. For adaptation to new data and tasks, e.g., in continual learning, existing methods typically involve tuning learnable parameters or complete re-training from scratch, rendering such approaches unflexible in practice. We argue that the notion of separating computation from memory by the means of transduction can act as a stepping stone for solving these issues. We therefore propose PARMESAN (parameter-free memory search and transduction), a scalable method which leverages a memory module for solving dense prediction tasks. At inference, hidden representations in memory are being searched to find corresponding patterns. In contrast to other methods that rely on continuous training of learnable parameters, PARMESAN learns via memory consolidation simply by modifying stored contents. Our method is compatible with commonly used architectures and canonically transfers to 1D, 2D, and 3D grid-based data. The capabilities of our approach are demonstrated at the complex task of continual learning. PARMESAN learns by 3-4 orders of magnitude faster than established baselines while being on par in terms of predictive performance, hardware-efficiency, and knowledge retention.",

    "summary": "The development of machine learning applications has increased significantly in recent years, motivated by the remarkable ability of learning-powered systems to discover and generalize intricate patterns hidden in massive datasets. Modern learning models, while powerful, often exhibit a complexity level that renders them opaque black boxes, lacking transparency and hindering our understanding of their decision-making processes. Opacity challenges the practical application of machine learning, especially in critical domains requiring informed decisions. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses that challenge, unraveling the complexity of black boxes by providing explanations. Feature attribution/importance XAI stands out for its ability to delineate the significance of input features in predictions. However, most attribution methods have limitations, such as instability, when divergent explanations result from similar or the same instance. This work introduces T-Explainer, a novel additive attribution explainer based on the Taylor expansion that offers desirable properties such as local accuracy and consistency. We demonstrate T-Explainer's effectiveness and stability over multiple runs in quantitative benchmark experiments against well-known attribution methods. Additionally, we provide several tools to evaluate and visualize explanations, turning T-Explainer into a comprehensive XAI framework.",

    "summary": "Pretraining and finetuning models has become increasingly popular in decision-making. But there are still serious impediments in Imitation Learning from Observation (ILfO) with pretrained models. This study identifies two primary obstacles: the Embodiment Knowledge Barrier (EKB) and the Demonstration Knowledge Barrier (DKB). The EKB emerges due to the pretrained models' limitations in handling novel observations, which leads to inaccurate action inference. Conversely, the DKB stems from the reliance on limited demonstration datasets, restricting the model's adaptability across diverse scenarios. We propose separate solutions to overcome each barrier and apply them to Action Inference by Maximising Evidence (AIME), a state-of-the-art algorithm. This new algorithm, AIME-NoB, integrates online interactions and a data-driven regulariser to mitigate the EKB. Additionally, it uses a surrogate reward function to broaden the policy's supported states, addressing the DKB. Our experiments on vision-based control tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite and MetaWorld benchmarks show that AIME-NoB significantly improves sample efficiency and converged performance, presenting a robust framework for overcoming the challenges in ILfO with pretrained models.

To address these gaps, we introduce an innovative \\textbf{M}otif-b\\textbf{A}sed \\textbf{G}NN \\textbf{E}xplainer (MAGE) that uses motifs as fundamental units for generating explanations. Our approach begins with extracting potential motifs through a motif decomposition technique. Then, we utilize an attention-based learning method to identify class-specific motifs. Finally, we employ a motif-based graph generator for each class to create molecular graph explanations based on these class-specific motifs. This novel method not only incorporates critical substructures into the explanations but also guarantees their validity, yielding results that are human-understandable. Our proposed method's effectiveness is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative assessments conducted on six real-world molecular datasets.",

    "summary": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) policies are highly susceptible to adversarial noise in observations, which poses significant risks in safety-critical scenarios. The challenge inherent to adversarial perturbations is that by altering the information observed by the agent, the state becomes only partially observable. Existing approaches address this by either enforcing consistent actions across nearby states or maximizing the worst-case value within adversarially perturbed observations. However, the former suffers from performance degradation when attacks succeed, while the latter tends to be overly conservative, leading to suboptimal performance in benign settings. We hypothesize that these limitations stem from their failing to account for partial observability directly. To this end, we introduce a novel objective called Adversarial Counterfactual Error (ACoE), defined on the beliefs about the true state and balancing value optimization with robustness. To make ACoE scalable in model-free settings, we propose the theoretically-grounded surrogate objective Cumulative-ACoE (C-ACoE). Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks (MuJoCo, Atari, and Highway) demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches for addressing adversarial RL challenges, offering a promising direction for improving robustness in DRL under adversarial conditions.

GameNGen runs at 20 frames per second on a single TPU and remains stable over extended multi-minute play sessions. Next frame prediction achieves a PSNR of 29.4, comparable to lossy JPEG compression. Human raters are only slightly better than random chance at distinguishing short clips of the game from clips of the simulation, even after 5 minutes of auto-regressive generation. GameNGen is trained in two phases: (1) an RL-agent learns to play the game and the training sessions are recorded, and (2) a diffusion model is trained to produce the next frame, conditioned on the sequence of past frames and actions. Conditioning augmentations help ensure stable auto-regressive generation over long trajectories, and decoder fine-tuning improves the fidelity of visual details and text.",

For time-dependent PDEs, many approaches are Markovian -- the evolution of the trained system only depends on the current state, and not the past states. In this work, we investigate the benefits of using memory for modeling time-dependent PDEs: that is, when past states are explicitly used to predict the future. Motivated by the Mori-Zwanzig theory of model reduction, we theoretically exhibit examples of simple (even linear) PDEs, in which a solution that uses memory is arbitrarily better than a Markovian solution. Additionally, we introduce Memory Neural Operator (MemNO), a neural operator architecture that combines recent state space models (specifically, S4) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) to effectively model memory. We empirically demonstrate that when the PDEs are supplied in low resolution or contain observation noise at train and test time, MemNO significantly outperforms the baselines without memory -- with up to 6x reduction in test error. Furthermore, we show that this benefit is particularly pronounced when the PDE solutions have significant high-frequency Fourier modes (e.g., low-viscosity fluid dynamics) and we construct a challenging benchmark dataset consisting of such PDEs.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success at tasks like summarization that involve a single turn of interaction. However, they can still struggle with multi-turn tasks like dialogue that require long-term planning. Previous works on multi-turn dialogue extend single-turn reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods to the multi-turn setting by treating all prior dialogue turns as a long context. Such approaches suffer from covariate shift: the conversations in the training set have previous turns generated by some reference policy, which means that low training error may not necessarily correspond to good performance when the learner is actually in the conversation loop. In response, we introduce REgressing the RELative FUture (REFUEL), an efficient policy optimization approach designed to address multi-turn RLHF in LLMs. REFUEL employs a single model to estimate $Q$-values and trains on self-generated data, addressing the covariate shift issue. REFUEL frames the multi-turn RLHF problem as a sequence of regression tasks on iteratively collected datasets, enabling ease of implementation. Theoretically, we prove that REFUEL can match the performance of any policy covered by the training set. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm by using Llama-3.1-70B-it to simulate a user in conversation with our model. REFUEL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as DPO and REBEL across various settings. Furthermore, despite having only 8 billion parameters, Llama-3-8B-it fine-tuned with REFUEL outperforms Llama-3.1-70B-it on long multi-turn dialogues. Implementation of REFUEL can be found at this https URL, and models trained by REFUEL can be found at this https URL.",

    "summary": "Foundational Models are an emerging widely used technique of GenAI. These models are distinguished by their scalability and the ease with which they can be adapted through the exploitation of Transfer Learning. The availability of high computational power and large datasets have supported their development, achieving a high generalization capacity due to the enormous and heterogeneous amounts of data used in their initial training. These characteristics contribute to a solid base that can be adapted or adjusted to a wide range of tasks, increasing their applicability. This study proposes the methodology LLIAM, a straightforward adaptation of a kind of FM, Large Language Models, for the Time Series Forecasting task. An adequate time-series prompting schema and Low-Rank Adaptations are used to enhance the knowledge of the model with diverse time series datasets, known as the fine-tuning phase. A study divided in two stages has been performed for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Initially, a comparison was made between the performance of LLIAM and different state-of-the-art DL algorithms, including Recurrent Neural Networks and Temporal Convolutional Networks, as well as a LLM-based method, TimeLLM. Following this, a zero-shot study is presented in order to evaluate the generalization capacity of the proposed methodology with time series datasets from unknown domains not considered in the model training. The outcomes of this investigation demonstrate the efficacy of LLIAM, highlighting that this straightforward and general approach can attain competent results without the necessity for applying complex modifications. This work also encourages the use of available resources (such as these pre-trained models) and efficient fine-tuning techniques to avoid unnecessary and costly training, narrowing the gap between the goals of traditional AI and Green AI.",

    "summary": "Extending Bayesian optimization to batch evaluation can enable the designer to make the most use of parallel computing technology. However, most of current batch approaches do not scale well with the batch size. That is, their performances deteriorate dramatically as the batch size increases. To address this issue, we propose a simple and efficient approach to extend Bayesian optimization to large-scale batch evaluation in this work. Different from existing batch approaches, the idea of the new approach is to draw a batch of axis-aligned subspaces of the original problem and select one acquisition point from each subspace. To achieve this, we propose the expected subspace improvement criterion to measure the amount of the improvement that a candidate point can achieve within a certain axis-aligned subspace. By optimizing these expected subspace improvement functions simultaneously, we can get a batch of query points for parallel evaluation. Numerical experiments show that our proposed approach can speedup the convergence significantly when compared with the sequential Bayesian optimization algorithm, and performs very competitively when compared with seven batch Bayesian optimization algorithms. A Matlab implementation of the proposed approach is available at this https URL.",

    "summary": "This research aims to know traffic anomalies as early as possible. A traffic anomaly refers to a generic incident on the road that influences traffic flow and calls for urgent traffic management measures. `Knowing'' the occurrence of a traffic anomaly is twofold: the ability to detect this anomaly before it is reported anywhere, or it may be such that an anomaly can be predicted before it actually occurs on the road (e.g., non-recurrent traffic breakdown). In either way, the objective is to inform traffic operators of unreported incidents in real time and as early as possible. The key is to stay ahead of the curve. Time is of the essence.\nConventional automatic incident detection (AID) methods often struggle with early detection due to their limited consideration of spatial effects and early-stage characteristics. Therefore, we propose a deep learning framework utilizing prior domain knowledge and model-designing strategies. This allows the model to detect a broader range of anomalies, not only incidents that significantly influence traffic flow but also early characteristics of incidents along with historically unreported anomalies. We specially design the model to target the early-stage detection/prediction of an incident. Additionally, unlike most conventional AID studies, our method is highly scalable and generalizable, as it is fully automated with no manual selection of historical reports required, relies solely on widely available low-cost data, and requires no additional detectors. The experimental results across numerous road segments on different maps demonstrate that our model leads to more effective and early anomaly detection.",

    "summary": "Machine learning algorithms in high-dimensional settings are highly susceptible to the influence of even a small fraction of structured outliers, making robust optimization techniques essential. In particular, within the $\\epsilon$-contamination model, where an adversary can inspect and replace up to an $\\epsilon$-fraction of the samples, a fundamental open problem is determining the optimal rates for robust stochastic convex optimization (SCO) under such contamination. We develop novel algorithms that achieve minimax-optimal excess risk (up to logarithmic factors) under the $\\epsilon$-contamination model. Our approach improves over existing algorithms, which are not only suboptimal but also require stringent assumptions, including Lipschitz continuity and smoothness of individual sample functions. By contrast, our optimal algorithms do not require these stringent assumptions, assuming only population-level smoothness of the loss. Moreover, our algorithms can be adapted to handle the case in which the covariance parameter is unknown, and can be extended to nonsmooth population risks via convolutional smoothing. We complement our algorithmic developments with a tight information-theoretic lower bound for robust SCO.",

In this work, we interpret Neural Network (NN) solutions to sequence based counting tasks through a variety of lenses. We seek to understand how well we can understand NNs through the lens of interpretable Symbolic Algorithms (SAs), where SAs are defined by precise, abstract, mutable variables used to perform computations. We use GRUs, LSTMs, and Transformers trained using Next Token Prediction (NTP) on numeric tasks where the solutions to the tasks depend on numeric information only latent in the task structure. We show through multiple causal and theoretical methods that we can interpret NN's raw activity through the lens of simplified SAs when we frame the neural activity in terms of interpretable subspaces rather than individual neurons. Depending on the analysis, however, these interpretations can be graded, existing on a continuum, highlighting the philosophical question of what it means to \"interpret\" neural activity, and motivating us to introduce Alignment Functions to add flexibility to the existing Distributed Alignment Search (DAS) method. Through our specific analyses we show the importance of causal interventions for NN interpretability; we show that recurrent models develop graded, symbol-like number variables within their neural activity; we introduce a generalization of DAS to frame NN activity in terms of linear functions of interpretable variables; and we show that Transformers must use anti-Markovian solutions -- solutions that avoid using cumulative, Markovian hidden states -- in the absence of sufficient attention layers. We use our results to encourage interpreting NNs at the level of neural subspaces through the lens of SAs.",

The answer to this question is goal-dependent, and it is often addressed through correlative methods such as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). We find ourselves chiefly interested in the relationship between representations and behavior, asking ourselves how we can isolate specific functional aspects of representational similarity to relate our measures to behavior -- avoiding cause vs. correlation pitfalls in the process. In this work, we introduce Model Alignment Search (MAS), a method for causally exploring distributed representational similarity as it relates to behavior. The method learns invertible linear transformations that find an aligned subspace between two distributed networks' representations where functional information can be isolated and manipulated. We first show that the method can be used to transfer values of specific causal variables -- such as the number of items in a counting task -- between networks with different training seeds and different architectures. We then explore open questions in number cognition by comparing different types of numeric representations in models trained on structurally different tasks, we explore differences between MAS and preexisting functional similarity methods, and lastly, we introduce a counterfactual latent auxiliary loss that helps shape functionally relevant alignments even in cases where we do not have causal access to one of the two models for training.",

We present GRAGPoison, a novel attack that exploits shared relations in the underlying knowledge graph to craft poisoning text capable of compromising multiple queries simultaneously. GRAGPoison employs three key strategies: i) relation injection to introduce false knowledge, ii) relation enhancement to amplify poisoning influence, and iii) narrative generation to embed malicious content within coherent text. Empirical evaluation across diverse datasets and models shows that GRAGPoison substantially outperforms existing attacks in terms of effectiveness (up to 98\\% success rate) and scalability (using less than 68\\% poisoning text) on various GraphRAG-based systems. We also explore potential defensive measures and their limitations, identifying promising directions for future research.",

    "summary": "The goal of diffusion generative models is to align the learned distribution with the real data distribution through gradient score matching. However, inherent limitations in training data quality, modeling strategies, and architectural design lead to inevitable gap between generated outputs and real data. To reduce this gap, we propose Weak-to-Strong Diffusion (W2SD), a novel framework that utilizes the estimated difference between existing weak and strong models (i.e., weak-to-strong difference) to bridge the gap between an ideal model and a strong model. By employing a reflective operation that alternates between denoising and inversion with weak-to-strong difference, we theoretically understand that W2SD steers latent variables along sampling trajectories toward regions of the real data distribution. W2SD is highly flexible and broadly applicable, enabling diverse improvements through the strategic selection of weak-to-strong model pairs (e.g., DreamShaper vs. SD1.5, good experts vs. bad experts in MoE). Extensive experiments demonstrate that W2SD significantly improves human preference, aesthetic quality, and prompt adherence, achieving SOTA performance across various modalities (e.g., image, video), architectures (e.g., UNet-based, DiT-based, MoE), and benchmarks. For example, Juggernaut-XL with W2SD can improve with the HPSv2 winning rate up to 90% over the original results. Moreover, the performance gains achieved by W2SD markedly outweigh its additional computational overhead, while the cumulative improvements from different weak-to-strong difference further solidify its practical utility and deployability.",

However, the best known finite-time rates are much slower. We derive the first non-asymptotic central limit theorem with respect to the Wasserstein-1 distance for two-time-scale stochastic approximation with Polyak-Ruppert averaging. As a corollary, we show that expected error achieved by Polyak-Ruppert averaging decays at rate $1/\\sqrt{n}$, which significantly improves on the rates of convergence in prior works.",

To address this issue, we propose a novel methodology that infers the outcome of analytics operators by creating a model from datasets similar to the queried one. Dataset similarity is performed via projecting each dataset to a vector embedding representation. The vectorization process is performed using our proposed deep learning model NumTabData2Vec, which takes a whole dataset and projects it into a lower vector embedding representation space. Through experimental evaluation, we compare the prediction performance and the execution time of our framework to another state-of-the-art modelling operator framework, illustrating that our approach predicts analytics outcomes accurately.

In this work, we propose KVTP (Keyframe-oriented Vision Token Pruning), a novel framework that overcomes the drawbacks of token pruning and keyframe selection. By adaptively assigning pruning rates based on frame relevance to the query, KVTP effectively retains essential contextual information while significantly reducing redundant computation. To thoroughly evaluate the long-form video understanding capacities of VLMs, we curated and reorganized subsets from VideoMME, EgoSchema, and NextQA into a unified benchmark named SparseKV-QA that highlights real-world scenarios with sparse but crucial events. Our experiments with VLMs of various scales show that KVTP can reduce token usage by 80% without compromising spatiotemporal and contextual consistency, significantly cutting computation while maintaining the performance.

This decision should take into account both the variability of the objective functions and the current estimate of a point in relation to the Pareto front. Since the amount and distribution of noise are generally unknown, it is desirable for a decision function to be highly adaptive to the properties of the optimization problem. This paper presents a resampling decision function that incorporates the stochastic nature of the optimization problem by using bootstrapping and the probability of dominance. The distribution-free estimation of the probability of dominance is achieved using bootstrap estimates of the means. To make the procedure applicable even with very few observations, we transfer the distribution observed at other decision points. The efficiency of this resampling approach is demonstrated by applying it in the NSGA-II algorithm with a sequential resampling procedure under multiple noise variations.",

A momentum-updated teacher network defines a dynamic, data-dependent prior, while the student encoder produces an approximate posterior from augmented views. The reconstruction term in the ELBO is replaced with a cross-view denoising objective, preserving the analytical tractability of Gaussian KL divergence. We further introduce cosine-based formulations of KL and log-likelihood terms to enhance semantic alignment in high-dimensional latent spaces. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 show that VSSL achieves competitive or superior performance to leading self-supervised methods, including BYOL and MoCo V3. VSSL offers a scalable, probabilistically grounded approach to learning transferable representations without generative reconstruction, bridging the gap between variational modeling and modern self-supervised techniques.",

    "summary": "It often happens that some sensitive personal information, such as credit card numbers or passwords, are mistakenly incorporated in the training of machine learning models and need to be removed afterwards. The removal of such information from a trained model is a complex task that needs to partially reverse the training process. There have been various machine unlearning techniques proposed in the literature to address this problem. Most of the proposed methods revolve around removing individual data samples from a trained model. Another less explored direction is when features/labels of a group of data samples need to be reverted. While the existing methods for these tasks do the unlearning task by updating the whole set of model parameters or only the last layer of the model, we show that there are a subset of model parameters that have the largest contribution in the unlearning target features. More precisely, the model parameters with the largest corresponding diagonal value in the Hessian matrix (computed at the learned model parameter) have the most contribution in the unlearning task. By selecting these parameters and updating them during the unlearning stage, we can have the most progress in unlearning. We provide theoretical justifications for the proposed strategy by connecting it to sharpness-aware minimization and robust unlearning. We empirically show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in improving the efficacy of unlearning with a low computational cost.",

    "summary": "One global model in federated learning (FL) might not be sufficient to serve many clients with non-IID tasks and distributions. While there has been advances in FL to train multiple global models for better personalization, they only provide limited choices to clients so local finetuning is still indispensable. In this paper, we propose a novel ``FedMerge'' approach that can create a personalized model per client by simply merging multiple global models with automatically optimized and customized weights. In FedMerge, a few global models can serve many non-IID clients, even without further local finetuning. We formulate this problem as a joint optimization of global models and the merging weights for each client. Unlike existing FL approaches where the server broadcasts one or multiple global models to all clients, the server only needs to send a customized, merged model to each client. Moreover, instead of periodically interrupting the local training and re-initializing it to a global model, the merged model aligns better with each client's task and data distribution, smoothening the local-global gap between consecutive rounds caused by client drift. We evaluate FedMerge on three different non-IID settings applied to different domains with diverse tasks and data types, in which FedMerge consistently outperforms existing FL approaches, including clustering-based and mixture-of-experts (MoE) based methods.",

This contrasts with humans' natural writing and reasoning process, where goals are typically known before the exact argument or phrasings. While this mismatch has been well studied in the literature, the working assumption has been that architectural changes are needed to address this mismatch. We argue that rearranging and processing the training data sequences can allow models to more accurately imitate the true data-generating process, and does not require any other changes to the architecture or training infrastructure. We demonstrate that this technique, Trelawney, and the inference algorithms derived from it allow us to improve performance on several key benchmarks that span planning, algorithmic reasoning, and story generation tasks. Finally, our method naturally enables the generation of long-term goals at no additional cost. We investigate how using the model's goal-generation capability can further improve planning and reasoning. Additionally, we believe Trelawney could potentially open doors to new capabilities beyond the current language modeling paradigm.",

However, this approach significantly increases computational costs and inference time, as the model must generate and evaluate multiple candidate solutions to identify a viable reasoning path. To address this, we propose an effective approach that integrates search capabilities directly into the model by fine-tuning it using both successful (learning) and failed reasoning paths (forgetting) derived from diverse search methods. While fine-tuning the model with these data might seem straightforward, we identify a critical issue: the model's search capability tends to degrade rapidly if fine-tuning is performed naively. We show that this degradation can be substantially mitigated by employing a smaller learning rate. Extensive experiments on the challenging Game-of-24 and Countdown mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our approach not only outperforms both standard fine-tuning and inference-time search baselines but also significantly reduces inference time by 180$\\times$.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities, particularly when enhanced through Reinforcement Learning (RL). While prior work has successfully applied RL to mathematical reasoning -- where rules and correctness are well-defined -- generalizing these methods to broader reasoning domains remains challenging due to limited data, the lack of verifiable reward structures, and diverse task requirements. In this work, we propose NEMOTRON-CROSSTHINK, a framework that systematically incorporates multi-domain corpora, including both synthetic and real-world question-answer pairs, into RL training to improve generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. NEMOTRON-CROSSTHINK addresses key challenges by (1) incorporating data from varied sources spanning STEM, humanities, social sciences, etc.; (2) applying structured templates (e.g., multiple-choice and open-ended) to control answer-space complexity; (3) filtering for verifiable answers; and (4) optimizing data blending strategies that utilizes data from multiple sources effectively. Our approach enables scalable and verifiable reward modeling beyond mathematics and demonstrates improved accuracies on both math (MATH-500: +30.1%, AMC23:+27.5%) and non-math reasoning benchmarks (MMLU-PRO: +12.8%, GPQA-DIAMOND: +11.3%, AGIEVAL: +15.1%, SUPERGPQA: +3.8%). Moreover, NEMOTRON-CROSSTHINK exhibits significantly improved response efficiency -- using 28% fewer tokens for correct answers -- highlighting more focused and effective reasoning. Through NEMOTRON-CROSSTHINK, we demonstrate that integrating multi-domain, multi-format data in RL leads to more accurate, efficient, and generalizable LLMs.",

To address this, various learning paradigms have emerged that leverage different forms of human input to specify or refine the reward function. Reinforcement learning from human feedback is a prominent approach that utilizes human comparative feedback, expressed as a preference for one behavior over another, to tackle this problem. In contrast to comparative feedback, we explore multi-level human feedback, which is provided in the form of a score at the end of each episode. This type of feedback offers more coarse but informative signals about the underlying reward function than binary feedback. Additionally, it can handle non-Markovian rewards, as it is based on the evaluation of an entire episode. We propose an algorithm to efficiently learn both the reward function and the optimal policy from this form of feedback. Moreover, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves sublinear regret and demonstrate its empirical effectiveness through extensive simulations.",

This differential equation is controlled by two quantities, a contraction factor that brings together trajectories corresponding to slightly different datasets, and a perturbation factor that accounts for them training on different datasets. We analyze this differential equation to compute an ``effective Gram matrix'' that characterizes the generalization gap after training in terms of the alignment between this Gram matrix and a certain initial ``residual''. Empirical evaluations on image classification datasets indicate that this analysis can predict the test loss accurately. Further, at any point during training, the residual predominantly lies in the subspace of the effective Gram matrix with the smallest eigenvalues. This indicates that the training process is benign, i.e., it does not lead to significant deterioration of the generalization gap (which is zero at initialization). The alignment between the effective Gram matrix and the residual is different for different datasets and architectures. The match/mismatch of the data and the architecture is primarily responsible for good/bad generalization.",

A natural problem then is to analyse and compare the (not necessarily hierarchical) sequences of partitions that underpin such multiscale descriptions. Here, we use tools from topological data analysis and introduce the Multiscale Clustering Filtration (MCF), a well-defined and stable filtration of abstract simplicial complexes that encodes arbitrary cluster assignments in a sequence of partitions across scales of increasing coarseness. We show that the zero-dimensional persistent homology of the MCF measures the degree of hierarchy of this sequence, and the higher-dimensional persistent homology tracks the emergence and resolution of conflicts between cluster assignments across the sequence of partitions. To broaden the theoretical foundations of the MCF, we provide an equivalent construction via a nerve complex filtration, and we show that, in the hierarchical case, the MCF reduces to a Vietoris-Rips filtration of an ultrametric space. Using synthetic data, we then illustrate how the persistence diagram of the MCF provides a feature map that can serve to characterise and classify multiscale clusterings.",

First, we replaced the L1 loss in the pix2pix framework with the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss, which significantly reduced image blurriness. Second, we selected multispectral infrared (IR) bands as input based on a thorough examination of their spectral properties, providing essential physical information for accurate simulation. Third, we incorporated the direction parameters of the sun and the satellite, which addressed the dependence of VIS images on sunlight directions and enabled a much larger training set from continuous daytime data. The model was trained and validated using data from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) in the daytime, achieving statistical results of SSIM = 0.923 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.0299, which significantly surpasses existing models. We also performed a cross-satellite nighttime model validation using the Day/Night Band (DNB) of the Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which yields outstanding results compared to existing models. Our model is operationally applied to generate accurate VIS imagery with arbitrary virtual sunlight directions, significantly contributing to the nighttime monitoring of various meteorological phenomena.",

    "summary": "Given multi-category point sets from different place-types, our goal is to develop a spatially-lucid classifier that can distinguish between two classes based on the arrangements of their points. This problem is important for many applications, such as oncology, for analyzing immune-tumor relationships and designing new immunotherapies. It is challenging due to spatial variability and interpretability needs. Previously proposed techniques require dense training data or have limited ability to handle significant spatial variability within a single place-type. Most importantly, these deep neural network (DNN) approaches are not designed to work in non-Euclidean space, particularly point sets. Existing non-Euclidean DNN methods are limited to one-size-fits-all approaches. We explore a spatial ensemble framework that explicitly uses different training strategies, including weighted-distance learning rate and spatial domain adaptation, on various place-types for spatially-lucid classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets (e.g., MxIF oncology data) show that the proposed framework provides higher prediction accuracy than baseline methods.",

    "summary": "Uncertainty quantification in deep learning is crucial for safe and reliable decision-making in downstream tasks. Existing methods quantify uncertainty at the last layer or other approximations of the network which may miss some sources of uncertainty in the model. To address this gap, we propose an uncertainty quantification method for large networks based on variation due to regularization. Essentially, predictions that are more (less) sensitive to the regularization of network parameters are less (more, respectively) certain. This principle can be implemented by deterministically tweaking the training loss during the fine-tuning phase and reflects confidence in the output as a function of all layers of the network. We show that regularization variation (RegVar) provides rigorous uncertainty estimates that, in the infinitesimal limit, exactly recover the Laplace approximation in Bayesian deep learning. We demonstrate its success in several deep learning architectures, showing it can scale tractably with the network size while maintaining or improving uncertainty quantification quality. Our experiments across multiple datasets show that RegVar not only identifies uncertain predictions effectively but also provides insights into the stability of learned representations.",

    "summary": "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and early detection through low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has shown significant promise in reducing death rates. With the growing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical imaging, the development and evaluation of robust AI models require access to large, well-annotated datasets. In this study, we introduce the utility of Duke Lung Cancer Screening (DLCS) Dataset, the largest open-access LDCT dataset with over 2,000 scans and 3,000 expert-verified nodules. We benchmark deep learning models for both 3D nodule detection and lung cancer classification across internal and external datasets including LUNA16, LUNA25, and NLST-3D+. For detection, we develop two MONAI-based RetinaNet models (DLCSDmD and LUNA16-mD), evaluated using the Competition Performance Metric (CPM). For classification, we compare five models, including state-of-the-art pretrained models (Models Genesis, Med3D), a selfsupervised foundation model (FMCB), a randomly initialized ResNet50, and proposed a novel Strategic Warm-Start++ (SWS++) model. SWS++ uses curated candidate patches to pretrain a classification backbone within the same detection pipeline, enabling task-relevant feature learning. Our models demonstrated strong generalizability, with SWS++ achieving comparable or superior performance to existing foundational models across multiple datasets (AUC: 0.71 to 0.90). All code, models, and data are publicly released to promote reproducibility and collaboration. This work establishes a standardized benchmarking resource for lung cancer AI research, supporting future efforts in model development, validation, and clinical translation.",

    "summary": "Traffic pattern prediction has emerged as a promising approach for efficiently managing and mitigating the impacts of event-driven bursty traffic in massive machine-type communication (mMTC) networks. However, achieving accurate predictions of bursty traffic remains a non-trivial task due to the inherent randomness of events, and these challenges intensify within live network environments. Consequently, there is a compelling imperative to design a lightweight and agile framework capable of assimilating continuously collected data from the network and accurately forecasting bursty traffic in mMTC networks. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a machine learning-based framework tailored for forecasting bursty traffic in multi-channel slotted ALOHA networks. The proposed machine learning network comprises long-term short-term memory (LSTM) and a DenseNet with feed-forward neural network (FFNN) layers, where the residual connections enhance the training ability of the machine learning network in capturing complicated patterns. Furthermore, we develop a new low-complexity online prediction algorithm that updates the states of the LSTM network by leveraging frequently collected data from the mMTC network. Simulation results and complexity analysis demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm in terms of both accuracy and complexity, making it well-suited for time-critical live scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework in a network with a single base station and thousands of devices organized into groups with distinct traffic-generating characteristics. Comprehensive evaluations and simulations indicate that our proposed machine learning approach achieves a remarkable $52\\%$ higher accuracy in long-term predictions compared to traditional methods, without imposing additional processing load on the system.",

    "summary": "Central to the Transformer architectures' effectiveness is the self-attention mechanism, a function that maps queries, keys, and values into a high-dimensional vector space. However, training the attention weights of queries, keys, and values is non-trivial from a state of random initialization. In this paper, we propose two methods. (i) We first address the initialization problem of Vision Transformers by introducing a simple, yet highly innovative, initialization approach utilizing discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients. Our proposed DCT-based \\textit{attention} initialization marks a significant gain compared to traditional initialization strategies; offering a robust foundation for the attention mechanism. Our experiments reveal that the DCT-based initialization enhances the accuracy of Vision Transformers in classification tasks. (ii) We also recognize that since DCT effectively decorrelates image information in the frequency domain, this decorrelation is useful for compression because it allows the quantization step to discard many of the higher-frequency components. Based on this observation, we propose a novel DCT-based compression technique for the attention function of Vision Transformers. Since high-frequency DCT coefficients usually correspond to noise, we truncate the high-frequency DCT components of the input patches. Our DCT-based compression reduces the size of weight matrices for queries, keys, and values. While maintaining the same level of accuracy, our DCT compressed Swin Transformers obtain a considerable decrease in the computational overhead.",

    "summary": "Images captured under low-light scenarios often suffer from low quality. Previous CNN-based deep learning methods often involve using Retinex theory. Nevertheless, most of them cannot perform well in more complicated datasets like LOL-v2 while consuming too much computational resources. Besides, some of these methods require sophisticated training at different stages, making the procedure even more time-consuming and tedious. In this paper, we propose a more accurate, concise, and one-stage Retinex theory based framework, RSEND. RSEND first divides the low-light image into the illumination map and reflectance map, then captures the important details in the illumination map and performs light enhancement. After this step, it refines the enhanced gray-scale image and does element-wise matrix multiplication with the reflectance map. By denoising the output it has from the previous step, it obtains the final result. In all the steps, RSEND utilizes Squeeze and Excitation network to better capture the details. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our Efficient Retinex model significantly outperforms other CNN-based models, achieving a PSNR improvement ranging from 0.44 dB to 4.2 dB in different datasets and even outperforms transformer-based models in the LOL-v2-real dataset.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a pivotal technique for empowering large language model (LLM) applications. Compared with the supervised training process of LLMs, the RLHF training process is much more sophisticated, requiring a diverse range of computation workloads with intricate dependencies between multiple LLM instances. Therefore, simply adopting the fixed parallelization strategies from supervised training for LLMs can be insufficient for RLHF and result in low training efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel technique named parameter ReaLlocation, which dynamically adapts the parallelization strategies for different workloads during training by redistributing LLM parameters across the training cluster. Building upon this idea, we introduce ReaL, a pioneering system for efficient RLHF training. ReaL introduces the concept of an execution plan, which defines a fine-grained resource allocation and parallelization strategy particularly designed for RLHF training. Based on this concept, ReaL employs a tailored search algorithm with a lightweight run-time estimator to automatically discover an efficient execution plan for an instance of RLHF experiment. Subsequently, the runtime engine deploys the selected plan by effectively parallelizing computations and redistributing parameters. We evaluate ReaL on the LLaMA models with up to 70 billion parameters and 128 GPUs. The experimental results demonstrate that ReaL achieves speedups of up to $3.58\\times$ compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, the execution plans generated by ReaL exhibit an average of $81\\%$ performance improvement over heuristic approaches based on Megatron-LM in the long-context scenario.

To address this gap, we curated a diverse dataset of real and synthetic lyrics from multiple languages, music genres, and artists. The generation pipeline was validated using both humans and automated methods. We performed a thorough evaluation of existing synthetic text detection approaches on lyrics, a previously unexplored data type. We also investigated methods to adapt the best-performing features to lyrics through unsupervised domain adaptation. Following both music and industrial constraints, we examined how well these approaches generalize across languages, scale with data availability, handle multilingual language content, and perform on novel genres in few-shot settings.

In this work, a novel approach that combines encoder-decoder architectures with domain decomposition strategies to address these challenges is proposed.

A communication network is added to facilitate inter-patch information exchange to enhance the understanding of spatial context. Experimental validation is performed on a synthetic dataset that is designed to measure the effectiveness of the communication network. Then, the performance is tested on the DeepGlobe land cover classification dataset as a real-world benchmark data set. The results demonstrate that the approach, which includes inter-patch communication for images divided into $16\\times16$ non-overlapping subimages, achieves a $2-3\\,\\%$ higher intersection over union (IoU) score compared to the same network without inter-patch communication. The performance of the network which includes communication is equivalent to that of a baseline U-Net trained on the full image, showing that our model provides an effective solution for segmenting ultra-high-resolution images while preserving spatial context.

In this work, we propose Set2Seq Transformer, a novel architecture that jointly models permutation-invariant set structure and temporal dependencies by learning temporal and positional-aware representations of sets within a sequence in an end-to-end multimodal manner. We evaluate our Set2Seq Transformer on two tasks that require modeling both set structure alongside temporal and positional patterns, but differ significantly in domain, modality, and objective. First, we consider a fine-art analysis task, modeling artists' oeuvres for predicting artistic success using a novel dataset, WikiArt-Seq2Rank. Second, we utilize our Set2Seq Transformer for a short-term wildfire danger forecasting task. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our Set2Seq Transformer significantly improves over traditional static multiple-instance learning methods by effectively learning permutation-invariant set, temporal, and positional-aware representations across diverse domains, modalities, and tasks.

The predictive performance of these models is typically assessed through discrimination and calibration. Changes in the distribution of the data impact model performance and there may be important changes between a model's current application and when and where its performance was last evaluated. In health-care, a typical change is a shift in case-mix. For example, for cardiovascular risk management, a general practitioner sees a different mix of patients than a specialist in a tertiary hospital.\nThis work introduces a novel framework that differentiates the effects of case-mix shifts on discrimination and calibration based on the causal direction of the prediction task. When prediction is in the causal direction (often the case for prognosis predictions), calibration remains stable under case-mix shifts, while discrimination does not. Conversely, when predicting in the anti-causal direction (often with diagnosis predictions), discrimination remains stable, but calibration does not.\nA simulation study and empirical validation using cardiovascular disease prediction models demonstrate the implications of this framework. The causal case-mix framework provides insights for developing, evaluating and deploying prediction models across different clinical settings, emphasizing the importance of understanding the causal structure of the prediction task.",

The skeptical thinking of humankind could be useful for LLMs to self-cognition, self-reflection and alleviate their hallucinations. Inspired by this consideration, we propose a novel approach called LaMsS, which combines the semantic understanding capability of LLMs with self-skepticism. By introducing a series of skepticism tokens and augmenting them into the vocabulary, we conduct both pertaining and finetuning, which allow the LLM to decode each normal token followed by a skeptical token, representing different skepticism levels. By calculating the response skepticism given a query, one can define a new self-aware LLM which is only willing to answer with relative lower skepticism level than the threshold. By examining the accuracy, AUC and AP of willingly answering questions, we demonstrate that LaMsS achieves better performance than baselines on both multi-choice questions and open-domain question-answering benchmarks, and can generalize to multi-task and out-of-domain settings. Our study sheds some lights on the self-skepticism modeling on further artificial intelligence. Project code and model checkpoints can be found in this https URL.",

The Earth observation (EO) field has produced several foundation models pre-trained directly on multispectral satellite imagery for applications like precision agriculture, wildfire and drought monitoring, and natural disaster response. However, few studies have investigated the ability of these models to generalize to new geographic locations, and potential concerns of geospatial bias -- models trained on data-rich developed nations not transferring well to data-scarce developing nations -- remain. We investigate the ability of popular EO foundation models to transfer to new geographic regions in the agricultural domain, where differences in farming practices and class imbalance make transfer learning particularly challenging. We first select five crop classification datasets across five continents, normalizing for dataset size and harmonizing classes to focus on four major cereal grains: maize, soybean, rice, and wheat. We then compare three popular foundation models, pre-trained on SSL4EO-S12, SatlasPretrain, and ImageNet, using in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation. Experiments show that pre-trained weights designed explicitly for Sentinel-2, such as SSL4EO-S12, outperform general pre-trained weights like ImageNet. Furthermore, while only 100 labeled images are sufficient for achieving high overall accuracy, 900 images are required to achieve high average accuracy due to class imbalance.

    "summary": "One of the growing trends in machine learning is the use of data generation techniques, since the performance of machine learning models is dependent on the quantity of the training dataset. However, in many real-world applications, particularly in medical and low-resource domains, collecting large datasets is challenging due to resource constraints, which leads to overfitting and poor generalization. This study introduces FICAug, a novel feature-to-image data augmentation framework designed to improve model generalization under limited data conditions by generating structured synthetic samples.\nFICAug first operates in the feature space, where original data are clustered using the k-means algorithm. Within pure-label clusters, synthetic data are generated through Gaussian sampling to increase diversity while maintaining label consistency. These synthetic features are then projected back into the image domain using a generative neural network, and a convolutional neural network is trained on the reconstructed images to learn enhanced representations.\nExperimental results demonstrate that FICAug significantly improves classification accuracy. In feature space, it achieved a cross-validation accuracy of 84.09%, while training a ResNet-18 model on the reconstructed images further boosted performance to 88.63%, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework in extracting new and task-relevant features.",

    "summary": "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) are powerful state-of-the-art methods used to generate synthetic data from high-dimensional data distributions and are widely used for image, audio, and video generation as well as many more applications in science and beyond. The \\textit{manifold hypothesis} states that high-dimensional data often lie on lower-dimensional manifolds within the ambient space, and is widely believed to hold in provided examples. While recent results have provided invaluable insight into how diffusion models adapt to the manifold hypothesis, they do not capture the great empirical success of these models, making this a very fruitful research direction.\nIn this work, we study DDPMs under the manifold hypothesis and prove that they achieve rates independent of the ambient dimension in terms of score learning. In terms of sampling complexity, we obtain rates independent of the ambient dimension w.r.t. the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and $O(\\sqrt{D})$ w.r.t. the Wasserstein distance. We do this by developing a new framework connecting diffusion models to the well-studied theory of extrema of Gaussian Processes.",

We introduce Selective Attention, a simple parameter-free change to the standard attention mechanism which reduces attention to unneeded elements. Selective attention consistently improves language modeling and downstream task performance in a variety of model sizes and context lengths. For example, transformers trained with the language modeling objective on C4 with selective attention perform language modeling equivalently to standard transformers with ~2X more heads and parameters in their attention modules. Selective attention also allows decreasing the size of the attention's context buffer, leading to meaningful reductions in the memory and compute requirements during inference. For example, transformers trained on C4 with context sizes of 512, 1,024, and 2,048 need 16X, 25X, and 47X less memory for their attention module, respectively, when equipped with selective attention, as those without selective attention, with the same validation perplexity.",

In many applications, this distribution is believed to concentrate on a much lower $d$-dimensional manifold embedded into $D$-dimensional space; this is known as the manifold hypothesis. The current best-known convergence guarantees are either linear in $D$ or polynomial (superlinear) in $d$. The latter exploits a novel integration scheme for the backward SDE. We take the best of both worlds and show that the number of steps diffusion models require in order to converge in Kullback-Leibler~(KL) divergence is linear (up to logarithmic terms) in the intrinsic dimension $d$.

    "summary": "The large models, as predicted by scaling raw forecasts, have made groundbreaking progress in many fields, particularly in natural language generation tasks, where they have approached or even surpassed human levels. However, the unprecedented scale of their parameters brings significant computational and storage costs. These large models require substantial computational resources and GPU memory to operate. When adapting large models to specific downstream tasks, their massive parameter scale poses a significant challenge in fine-tuning on hardware platforms with limited computational power and GPU memory. To address this issue, Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) offers a practical solution by efficiently adjusting the parameters of large pre-trained models to suit various downstream tasks. Specifically, PEFT adjusts the parameters of pre-trained large models to adapt to specific tasks or domains, minimizing the introduction of additional parameters and the computational resources required. This review mainly introduces the preliminary knowledge of PEFT, the core ideas and principles of various PEFT algorithms, the applications of PEFT, and potential future research directions. By reading this review, we believe that interested parties can quickly grasp the PEFT methodology, thereby accelerating its development and innovation.",

    "summary": "Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another. Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc. We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans breaks down these projects into 17874 fragments and translates the entire repository. 96.40% of the translated fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 27.03% and 25.14% of fragments. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 34 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.",

The distributions of the $M$ data sequences belong to $K$ underlying distribution clusters. Existing results on exponentially consistent nonparametric clustering algorithms, like single linkage-based (SLINK) clustering and $k$-medoids distribution clustering, assume that the maximum intra-cluster distance ($d_L$) is smaller than the minimum inter-cluster distance ($d_H$). First, in the fixed sample size (FSS) setting, we show that exponential consistency can be achieved for SLINK clustering under a less strict assumption, $d_I < d_H$, where $d_I$ is the maximum distance between any two sub-clusters of a cluster that partition the cluster. Note that $d_I < d_L$ in general. Thus, our results show that SLINK is exponentially consistent for a larger class of problems than previously known. In our simulations, we also identify examples where $k$-medoids clustering is unable to find the true clusters, but SLINK is exponentially consistent. Then, we propose a sequential clustering algorithm, named SLINK-SEQ, based on SLINK and prove that it is also exponentially consistent. Simulation results show that the SLINK-SEQ algorithm requires fewer expected number of samples than the FSS SLINK algorithm for the same probability of error.",

Here, we describe a study evaluating the usefulness of our tool tracking model in automated assessment during a laparoscopic suturing task in the fundoplication procedure. An automated tool tracking model was applied to recorded videos of Nissen fundoplication on porcine bowel. Surgeons were grouped as novices (PGY1-2) and experts (PGY3-5, attendings). The beginning and end of each suturing step were segmented, and motions of the left and right tools were extracted. A low-pass filter with a 24 Hz cut-off frequency removed noise. Performance was assessed using supervised and unsupervised models, and an ablation study compared results. Kinematic features--RMS velocity, RMS acceleration, RMS jerk, total path length, and Bimanual Dexterity--were extracted and analyzed using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, and XGBoost. PCA was performed for feature reduction. For unsupervised learning, a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) model with classifiers, such as a 1-D CNN and traditional models, was trained. Data were extracted for 28 participants (9 novices, 19 experts). Supervised learning with PCA and Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 0.795 and an F1 score of 0.778. The unsupervised 1-D CNN achieved superior results with an accuracy of 0.817 and an F1 score of 0.806, eliminating the need for kinematic feature computation.

At the same time, its architecture is designed so that trained models can be directly translated into interpretable policies expressed as standard (bivalent or probabilistic) logic programs. Moreover, additional layers can be included to extract abstract features from complex observations, acting as a form of predicate invention. The logic representations are highly interpretable, and we show how the bivalent representations of deterministic policies can be edited and incorporated back into a neural model, facilitating manual intervention and adaptation of learned policies. We evaluate our approach on a range of tasks requiring learning deterministic or stochastic behaviours from various forms of observations.

However, there are some situations in which quantitative features of the artwork can support these evaluations. The extraction of these features can sometimes be automated, for instance, with the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. An example of these features is represented by repeated, mechanically impressed patterns, called punches, present chiefly in 13th and 14th-century panel paintings from Tuscany. Previous research in art history showcased a strong connection between the shapes of punches and specific artists or workshops, suggesting the possibility of using these quantitative cues to support the attribution. In the present work, we first collect a dataset of large-scale images of these panel paintings. Then, using YOLOv10, a recent and popular object detection model, we train a ML pipeline to perform object detection on the punches contained in the images. Due to the large size of the images, the detection procedure is split across multiple frames by adopting a sliding-window approach with overlaps, after which the predictions are combined for the whole image using a custom non-maximal suppression routine. Our results indicate how art historians working in the field can reliably use our method for the identification and extraction of punches.",

In this paper, we introduce a synthetic learning task, \"FTCT\" (Fragmented at Training, Chained at Testing), to validate the potential of Transformers in replicating this skill and interpret its inner mechanism. In the training phase, data consist of separated knowledge fragments from an overall causal graph. During testing, Transformers must infer complete causal graph traces by integrating these fragments. Our findings demonstrate that few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting enables Transformers to perform compositional reasoning on FTCT by revealing correct combinations of fragments, even if such combinations were absent in the training data. Furthermore, the emergence of compositional reasoning ability is strongly correlated with the model complexity and training-testing data similarity. We propose, both theoretically and empirically, that Transformers learn an underlying generalizable program from training, enabling effective compositional reasoning during testing.",

    "summary": "Machine learning models are increasingly used to produce predictions that serve as input data in subsequent statistical analyses. For example, computer vision predictions of economic and environmental indicators based on satellite imagery are used in downstream regressions; similarly, language models are widely used to approximate human ratings and opinions in social science research. However, failure to properly account for errors in the machine learning predictions renders standard statistical procedures invalid. Prior work uses what we call the Predict-Then-Debias estimator to give valid confidence intervals when machine learning algorithms impute missing variables, assuming a small complete sample from the population of interest. We expand the scope by introducing bootstrap confidence intervals that apply when the complete data is a nonuniform (i.e., weighted, stratified, or clustered) sample and to settings where an arbitrary subset of features is imputed. Importantly, the method can be applied to many settings without requiring additional calculations. We prove that these confidence intervals are valid under no assumptions on the quality of the machine learning model and are no wider than the intervals obtained by methods that do not use machine learning predictions.",

    "summary": "In everyday life, we perform tasks (e.g., cooking or cleaning) that involve a large variety of objects and goals. When confronted with an unexpected or unwanted outcome, we take corrective actions and try again until achieving the desired result. The reasoning performed to identify a cause of the observed outcome and to select an appropriate corrective action is a crucial aspect of human reasoning for successful task execution. Central to this reasoning is the assumption that a factor is responsible for producing the observed outcome. In this paper, we investigate the use of probabilistic actual causation to determine whether a factor is the cause of an observed undesired outcome. Furthermore, we show how the actual causation probabilities can be used to find alternative actions to change the outcome. We apply the probabilistic actual causation analysis to a robot pouring task. When spillage occurs, the analysis indicates whether a task parameter is the cause and how it should be changed to avoid spillage. The analysis requires a causal graph of the task and the corresponding conditional probability distributions. To fulfill these requirements, we perform a complete causal modeling procedure (i.e., task analysis, definition of variables, determination of the causal graph structure, and estimation of conditional probability distributions) using data from a realistic simulation of the robot pouring task, covering a large combinatorial space of task parameters. Based on the results, we discuss the implications of the variables' representation and how the alternative actions suggested by the actual causation analysis would compare to the alternative solutions proposed by a human observer. The practical use of the analysis of probabilistic actual causation to select alternative action parameters is demonstrated.",

    "summary": "Reasoning has long been viewed as an emergent property of large language models (LLMs), appearing at or above a certain scale ($\\sim$100B parameters). However, recent studies challenge this assumption, showing that small language models (SLMs) can also achieve competitive reasoning performance. SLMs are increasingly favored for their efficiency and deployability. However, there is a lack of systematic study on the reasoning abilities of diverse SLMs, including those trained from scratch or derived from LLMs through quantization, pruning, and distillation. This raises a critical question: Can SLMs achieve reasoning abilities comparable to LLMs? In this work, we systematically survey, benchmark, and analyze 72 SLMs from six model families across 14 reasoning benchmarks. For reliable evaluation, we examine four evaluation methods and compare four LLM judges against human evaluations on 800 data points. We repeat all experiments three times to ensure a robust performance assessment. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different prompting strategies in small models. Beyond accuracy, we also evaluate model robustness under adversarial conditions and intermediate reasoning steps. Our findings challenge the assumption that scaling is the only way to achieve strong reasoning. Instead, we foresee a future where SLMs with strong reasoning capabilities can be developed through structured training or post-training compression. They can serve as efficient alternatives to LLMs for reasoning-intensive tasks.",

However, conventional deep learning and Transformer models often struggle to process data with inherent symmetries and invariances, typically relying on large datasets or extensive data augmentation. Equivariant neural networks overcome these limitations by explicitly integrating symmetry and invariance into their architectures, leading to improved efficiency and generalization. This tutorial survey reviews a wide range of equivariant deep learning and control methods for robotics, from classic to state-of-the-art, with a focus on SE(3)-equivariant models that leverage the natural 3D rotational and translational symmetries in visual robotic manipulation and control design. Using unified mathematical notation, we begin by reviewing key concepts from group theory, along with matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. We then introduce foundational group-equivariant neural network design and show how the group-equivariance can be obtained through their structure. Next, we discuss the applications of SE(3)-equivariant neural networks in robotics in terms of imitation learning and reinforcement learning. The SE(3)-equivariant control design is also reviewed from the perspective of geometric control. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions of equivariant methods in developing more robust, sample-efficient, and multi-modal real-world robotic systems.",

To address this, we present HyperDAS, a transformer-based hypernetwork architecture that (1) automatically locates the token-positions of the residual stream that a concept is realized in and (2) constructs features of those residual stream vectors for the concept. In experiments with Llama3-8B, HyperDAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the RAVEL benchmark for disentangling concepts in hidden states. In addition, we review the design decisions we made to mitigate the concern that HyperDAS (like all powerful interpretabilty methods) might inject new information into the target model rather than faithfully interpreting it.",

First, we find ``global'' similarities: token embeddings often share similar relative orientations. Next, we characterize local geometry in two ways: (1) by using Locally Linear Embeddings, and (2) by defining a simple measure for the intrinsic dimension of each token embedding. Our intrinsic dimension demonstrates that token embeddings lie on a lower dimensional manifold. We qualitatively show that tokens with lower intrinsic dimensions often have semantically coherent clusters, while those with higher intrinsic dimensions do not. Both characterizations allow us to find similarities in the local geometry of token embeddings. Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that alignment in token embeddings persists through the hidden states of language models, allowing us to develop an application for interpretability.

Instead, many practitioners simply use non-meta-models such as Gaussian processes with interpretable priors, and conduct the tedious procedure of training their model from scratch for each task they encounter. While this is justifiable for tasks with a limited number of data points, the cubic computational cost of exact Gaussian process inference renders this prohibitive when each task has many observations. To remedy this, we introduce a family of models that meta-learn sparse Gaussian process inference. Not only does this enable rapid prediction on new tasks with sparse Gaussian processes, but since our models have clear interpretations as members of the neural process family, it also allows manual elicitation of priors in a neural process for the first time. In meta-learning regimes for which the number of observed tasks is small or for which expert domain knowledge is available, this offers a crucial advantage.",

With recent advances in robotics and machine learning, there is a growing demand for these systems to operate in complex and unstructured environments. Traditional model-based approaches struggle to generalize across tasks and object variations due to the high dimensionality and complex contact dynamics of dexterous manipulation. Although model-free methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) show promise, they require extensive training, large-scale interaction data, and carefully designed rewards for stability and effectiveness. Imitation learning (IL) offers an alternative by allowing robots to acquire dexterous manipulation skills directly from expert demonstrations, capturing fine-grained coordination and contact dynamics while bypassing the need for explicit modeling and large-scale trial-and-error. This survey provides an overview of dexterous manipulation methods based on imitation learning, details recent advances, and addresses key challenges in the field. Additionally, it explores potential research directions to enhance IL-driven dexterous manipulation.

We prove that a large class of 'work-conserving' scheduling algorithms can achieve maximum throughput for individual inference LLM engine, highlighting 'work-conserving' as a key design principle in practice. In a network of LLM agents, work-conserving scheduling alone is insufficient, particularly when facing specific workload structures and multi-class workflows that require more sophisticated scheduling strategies.

Our key insight is to employ a language model (LM) as an inductive learner to extract code editing rules from the training code pairs as concise meta-rule sets. Such rule sets will be manifested for each training sample to augment them for finetuning or assist in prompting- and iterative-based code editing. EditLordoutperforms the state-of-the-art by an average of 22.7% in editing performance and 58.1% in robustness while achieving 20.2% higher functional correctness across critical software engineering and security applications, LM models, and editing modes.",

    "summary": "Various deep learning (DL) methods have recently been utilized to detect software vulnerabilities. Real-world software vulnerability datasets are rare and hard to acquire, as there is no simple metric for classifying vulnerability. Such datasets are heavily imbalanced, and none of the current datasets are considered huge for DL models. To tackle these problems, a recent work has tried to augment the dataset using the source code and generate realistic single-statement vulnerabilities, which is not quite practical and requires manual checking of the generated vulnerabilities. In this paper, we aim to explore the augmentation of vulnerabilities at the representation level to help current models learn better, which has never been done before to the best of our knowledge. We implement and evaluate five augmentation techniques that augment the embedding of the data and have recently been used for code search, which is a completely different software engineering task. We also introduced a conditioned version of those augmentation methods, which ensures the augmentation does not change the vulnerable section of the vector representation. We show that such augmentation methods can be helpful and increase the F1-score by up to 9.67%, yet they cannot beat Random Oversampling when balancing datasets, which increases the F1-score by 10.82%.",

    "summary": "LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex, agentic tasks requiring multifaceted reasoning and collaboration, from generating high-quality presentation slides to conducting sophisticated scientific research. Meanwhile, RL has been widely recognized for its effectiveness in enhancing agent intelligence, but limited research has investigated the fine-tuning of LaMAS using foundational RL techniques. Moreover, the direct application of MARL methodologies to LaMAS introduces significant challenges, stemming from the unique characteristics and mechanisms inherent to LaMAS. To address these challenges, this article presents a comprehensive study of LLM-based MARL and proposes a novel paradigm termed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MARFT). We introduce a universal algorithmic framework tailored for LaMAS, outlining the conceptual foundations, key distinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We begin by reviewing the evolution from RL to Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, setting the stage for a parallel analysis in the multi-agent domain. In the context of LaMAS, we elucidate critical differences between MARL and MARFT. These differences motivate a transition toward a novel, LaMAS-oriented formulation of RFT. Central to this work is the presentation of a robust and scalable MARFT framework. We detail the core algorithm and provide a complete, open-source implementation to facilitate adoption and further research. The latter sections of the paper explore real-world application perspectives and opening challenges in MARFT. By bridging theoretical underpinnings with practical methodologies, this work aims to serve as a roadmap for researchers seeking to advance MARFT toward resilient and adaptive solutions in agentic systems. Our implementation of the proposed framework is publicly available at: this https URL.",

    "summary": "Modeling path loss in indoor LoRaWAN technology deployments is inherently challenging due to structural obstructions, occupant density and activities, and fluctuating environmental conditions. This study proposes a two-stage approach to capture and analyze these complexities using an extensive dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements collected over six months in a single-floor office at the University of Siegen's Hoelderlinstrasse Campus, Germany. First, we implement a multiple linear regression model that includes traditional propagation metrics (distance, structural walls) and an extension with proposed environmental variables (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). Using analysis of variance, we demonstrate that adding these environmental factors can reduce unexplained variance by 42.32 percent. Secondly, we examine residual distributions by fitting five candidate probability distributions: Normal, Skew-Normal, Cauchy, Student's t, and Gaussian Mixture Models with one to five components. Our results show that a four-component Gaussian Mixture Model captures the residual heterogeneity of indoor signal propagation most accurately, significantly outperforming single-distribution approaches. Given the push toward ultra-reliable, context-aware communications in 6G networks, our analysis shows that environment-aware modeling can substantially improve LoRaWAN network design in dynamic indoor IoT deployments.",

Although (universal) pMC verification for reachability properties is known to be coETR-complete, there have been efforts to approach it using potentially easier-to-check properties such as asking whether the pMC is monotonic in certain parameters. In this paper, we first reduce monotonicity to asking whether the reachability probability from a given state is never less than that of another given state. Recent results for the latter property imply an efficient algorithm to collapse same-value equivalence classes, which in turn preserves verification results and monotonicity. We implement our algorithm to collapse \"trivial\" equivalence classes in the pMC and show empirical evidence for the following: First, the collapse gives reductions in size for some existing benchmarks and significant reductions on some custom benchmarks; Second, the collapse speeds up existing algorithms to check monotonicity and parameter lifting, and hence can be used as a fast pre-processing step in practice.",

By considering soft constraints as influences, the proposed model captures also situations where agents impose conditions on how others' opinions are integrated during belief revision. Finally, the flexibility offered by soft constraints allows us to introduce a novel polarisation measure that takes advantage of this generalised framework.",

The KLM framework defines a semantics for the propositional case of defeasible conditionals by construction of a preference ordering over possible worlds. The pattern of reasoning induced by these semantics is characterised by consequence relations satisfying certain desirable properties of non-monotonic reasoning. In FCA, implications are used to describe dependencies between attributes. However, these implications are unsuitable to reason with erroneous data or data prone to exceptions. Until recently, the topic of non-monotonic inference in FCA has remained largely uninvestigated. In this paper, we provide a construction of the KLM framework for defeasible reasoning in FCA and show that this construction remains faithful to the principle of non-monotonic inference described in the original framework. We present an additional argument that, while remaining consistent with the original ideas around non-monotonic reasoning, the defeasible reasoning we propose in FCA offers a more contextual view on inference, providing the ability for more relevant conclusions to be drawn when compared to the propositional case.",

In the same vein, they provide an interesting avenue for the exploration of formal verification and mechanistic interpretability. Since the introduction of code-specific models, despite their successes in generating code in Lean4 and Isabelle, the task of generalized theorem proving still remains far from being fully solved and will be a benchmark for reasoning capability in LLMs. In this work, we introduce a framework that generates whole proofs in a formal language to be used within systems that utilize the power of built-in tactics and off-the-shelf automated theorem provers. Our framework includes 3 components: generating natural language statements of the code to be verified, an LLM that generates formal proofs for the given statement, and a module employing heuristics for building the final proof. To train the LLM, we employ a 2-stage fine-tuning process, where we first use SFT-based training to enable the model to generate syntactically correct Isabelle code and then RL-based training that encourages the model to generate proofs verified by a theorem prover. We validate our framework using the miniF2F-test benchmark and the Isabelle proof assistant and design a use case to verify the correctness of the AWS S3 bucket access policy code. We also curate a dataset based on the FVEL\\textsubscript{\\textnormal{ER}} dataset for future training tasks.",

    "summary": "Converting high-level tasks described by natural language into formal specifications like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is a key step towards providing formal safety guarantees over cyber-physical systems (CPS). While the compliance of the formal specifications themselves against the safety restrictions imposed on CPS is crucial for ensuring safety, most existing works only focus on translation consistency between natural languages and formal specifications. In this paper, we introduce AutoSafeLTL, a self-supervised framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of LTL specifications complying with a set of safety restrictions while preserving their logical consistency and semantic accuracy. As a key insight, our framework integrates Language Inclusion check with an automated counterexample-guided modification mechanism to ensure the safety-compliance of the resulting LTL specifications. In particular, we develop 1) an LLM-as-an-Aligner, which performs atomic proposition matching between generated LTL specifications and safety restrictions to enforce semantic alignment; and 2) an LLM-as-a-Critic, which automates LTL specification refinement by interpreting counterexamples derived from Language Inclusion checks. Experimental results demonstrate that our architecture effectively guarantees safety-compliance for the generated LTL specifications, achieving a 0% violation rate against imposed safety restrictions. This shows the potential of our work in synergizing AI and formal verification techniques, enhancing safety-aware specification generation and automatic verification for both AI and critical CPS applications.",

At the same time, its architecture is designed so that trained models can be directly translated into interpretable policies expressed as standard (bivalent or probabilistic) logic programs. Moreover, additional layers can be included to extract abstract features from complex observations, acting as a form of predicate invention. The logic representations are highly interpretable, and we show how the bivalent representations of deterministic policies can be edited and incorporated back into a neural model, facilitating manual intervention and adaptation of learned policies. We evaluate our approach on a range of tasks requiring learning deterministic or stochastic behaviours from various forms of observations. Our empirical results show that our neural DNF-MT model performs at the level of competing black-box methods whilst providing interpretable policies.",

Today, heterogeneous air-ground collaborative multi-agent framework, which comprise unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), have presented superior flexibility and efficiency compared to traditional homogeneous frameworks in complex sensing tasks. Within this context, task allocation among different agents always play an important role in improving overall MCS quality. In order to better allocate tasks among heterogeneous collaborative agents, in this paper, we investigated two representative complex multi-agent task allocation scenarios with dual optimization objectives: (1) For AG-FAMT (Air-Ground Few Agents More Tasks) scenario, the objectives are to maximize the task completion while minimizing the total travel distance; (2) For AG-MAFT (Air-Ground More Agents Few Tasks) scenario, where the agents are allocated based on their locations, has the optimization objectives of minimizing the total travel distance while reducing travel time cost. To achieve this, we proposed a Multi-Task Minimum Cost Maximum Flow (MT-MCMF) optimization algorithm tailored for AG-FAMT, along with a multi-objective optimization algorithm called W-ILP designed for AG-MAFT, with a particular focus on optimizing the charging path planning of UAVs. Our experiments based on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrated that the proposed two algorithms both outperform baseline approaches under varying experimental settings, including task quantity, task difficulty, and task distribution, providing a novel way to improve the overall quality of mobile crowdsensing tasks.",

When numerous electric vehicles (EVs) charge concurrently, local transformers risk overloading - a problem that current tariff-based strategies do not adequately address. This paper introduces an aggregator-based coordination mechanism that shifts EV charging from congested to underutilized periods using a rule-based scheduling algorithm. Unlike conventional methods that depend on complex real-time pricing signals or optimization-heavy solutions, the aggregator approach uses a simple yet effective \"laxity\" measure to prioritize charging flexibility. To assess technical and economic viability, a multi-agent simulation was developed to replicate residential user behavior and DSO constraints under the use of a 400 kVA low-voltage transformer. The results indicate that overloads are completely eliminated with minimal inconvenience to users, whose increased charging costs are offset by the aggregator at an annual total of under DKK 6000 - significantly lower than the cost of infrastructure reinforcement. This study contributes by (i) quantifying the compensation needed to prevent large-scale overloads, (ii) presenting a replicable, computationally feasible, rule-based aggregator model for DSOs, and (iii) comparing aggregator solutions to costly transformer upgrades, underscoring the aggregator's role as a viable tool for future distribution systems.",

    "summary": "Agentic AI systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) as their foundational reasoning engine, are transforming clinical workflows such as medical report generation and clinical summarization by autonomously analyzing sensitive healthcare data and executing decisions with minimal human oversight. However, their adoption demands strict compliance with regulatory frameworks such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), particularly when handling Protected Health Information (PHI). This work-in-progress paper introduces a HIPAA-compliant Agentic AI framework that enforces regulatory compliance through dynamic, context-aware policy enforcement. Our framework integrates three core mechanisms: (1) Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for granular PHI governance, (2) a hybrid PHI sanitization pipeline combining regex patterns and BERT-based model to minimize leakage, and (3) immutable audit trails for compliance verification.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we address the problem of a two-player linear quadratic differential game with incomplete information, a scenario commonly encountered in multi-agent control, human-robot interaction (HRI), and approximation methods for solving general-sum differential games. While solutions to such linear differential games are typically obtained through coupled Riccati equations, the complexity increases when agents have incomplete information, particularly when neither is aware of the other's cost function. To tackle this challenge, we propose a model-based Peer-Aware Cost Estimation (PACE) framework for learning the cost parameters of the other agent. In PACE, each agent treats its peer as a learning agent rather than a stationary optimal agent, models their learning dynamics, and leverages this dynamic to infer the cost function parameters of the other agent. This approach enables agents to infer each other's objective function in real time based solely on their previous state observations and dynamically adapt their control policies. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of parameter estimation and the stability of system states in PACE. Additionally, in our numerical studies, we demonstrate how modeling the learning dynamics of the other agent benefits PACE, compared to approaches that approximate the other agent as having complete information, particularly in terms of stability and convergence speed.",

    "summary": "To jointly tackle the challenges of data and node heterogeneity in decentralized learning, we propose a distributed strong lottery ticket hypothesis (DSLTH), based on which a communication-efficient personalized learning algorithm is developed. In the proposed method, each local model is represented as the Hadamard product of global real-valued parameters and a personalized binary mask for pruning. The local model is learned by updating and fusing the personalized binary masks while the real-valued parameters are fixed among different agents. To further reduce the complexity of hardware implementation, we incorporate a group sparse regularization term in the loss function, enabling the learned local model to achieve structured sparsity. Then, a binary mask aggregation algorithm is designed by introducing an intermediate aggregation tensor and adding a personalized fine-tuning step in each iteration, which constrains model updates towards the local data distribution. The proposed method effectively leverages the relativity among agents while meeting personalized requirements in heterogeneous node conditions. We also provide a theoretical proof for the DSLTH, establishing it as the foundation of the proposed method. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of the DSLTH and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

    "summary": "LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex, agentic tasks requiring multifaceted reasoning and collaboration, from generating high-quality presentation slides to conducting sophisticated scientific research. Meanwhile, RL has been widely recognized for its effectiveness in enhancing agent intelligence, but limited research has investigated the fine-tuning of LaMAS using foundational RL techniques. Moreover, the direct application of MARL methodologies to LaMAS introduces significant challenges, stemming from the unique characteristics and mechanisms inherent to LaMAS. To address these challenges, this article presents a comprehensive study of LLM-based MARL and proposes a novel paradigm termed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MARFT). We introduce a universal algorithmic framework tailored for LaMAS, outlining the conceptual foundations, key distinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We begin by reviewing the evolution from RL to Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, setting the stage for a parallel analysis in the multi-agent domain. In the context of LaMAS, we elucidate critical differences between MARL and MARFT. These differences motivate a transition toward a novel, LaMAS-oriented formulation of RFT. Central to this work is the presentation of a robust and scalable MARFT framework. We detail the core algorithm and provide a complete, open-source implementation to facilitate adoption and further research. The latter sections of the paper explore real-world application perspectives and opening challenges in MARFT. By bridging theoretical underpinnings with practical methodologies, this work aims to serve as a roadmap for researchers seeking to advance MARFT toward resilient and adaptive solutions in agentic systems. Our implementation of the proposed framework is publicly available at: this https URL.",

Designing secure and efficient peer-to-peer (p2p) networking protocols at these scales to support the tight demands of the upper layer crypto-economic primitives is a highly non-trivial endeavor. We identify decentralized, uniform random sampling of nodes as a fundamental capability necessary for building robust p2p networks in emerging blockchain networks. Sampling algorithms used in practice today (primarily for address discovery) rely on either distributed hash tables (e.g., Kademlia) or sharing addresses with neighbors (e.g., GossipSub), and are not secure in a Sybil setting. We present Honeybee, a decentralized algorithm for sampling nodes that uses verifiable random walks and table consistency checks. Honeybee is secure against attacks even in the presence of an overwhelming number of Byzantine nodes (e.g., $\\geq50\\%$ of the network). We evaluate Honeybee through experiments and show that the quality of sampling achieved by Honeybee is significantly better compared to the state-of-the-art. Our proposed algorithm has implications for network design in both full nodes and light nodes.",

Despite their growing popularity, there remains a lack of comprehensive evaluation measuring the audio-visual capabilities of these models, especially in diverse scenarios (e.g., distribution shifts and adversarial attacks). In this paper, we present a multifaceted evaluation of the audio-visual capability of MLLMs, focusing on four key dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, generalizability, and robustness. Through extensive experiments, we find that MLLMs exhibit strong zero-shot and few-shot generalization abilities, enabling them to achieve great performance with limited data. However, their success relies heavily on the vision modality, which impairs performance when visual input is corrupted or missing. Additionally, while MLLMs are susceptible to adversarial samples, they demonstrate greater robustness compared to traditional models. The experimental results and our findings provide insights into the audio-visual capabilities of MLLMs, highlighting areas for improvement and offering guidance for future research.",

Creators can express their interpretations of music naturally through visual elements. However, the creation process of music video demands proficiency in script design, video shooting, and music-video synchronization, posing significant challenges for non-professionals. Previous work has designed automated music video generation frameworks. However, they suffer from complexity in input and poor output quality. In response, we present MV-Crafter, a system capable of producing high-quality music videos with synchronized music-video rhythm and style. Our approach involves three technical modules that simulate the human creation process: the script generation module, video generation module, and music-video synchronization module. MV-Crafter leverages a large language model to generate scripts considering the musical semantics. To address the challenge of synchronizing short video clips with music of varying lengths, we propose a dynamic beat matching algorithm and visual envelope-induced warping method to ensure precise, monotonic music-video synchronization. Besides, we design a user-friendly interface to simplify the creation process with intuitive editing features. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that MV-Crafter provides an effective solution for improving the quality of generated music videos.",

Some prior works have focused on high dynamic range (HDR) scene reconstruction, typically require capturing of multi-view sharp images with different exposure times at fixed camera positions during exposure times, which is time-consuming and challenging in practice. For a more flexible data acquisition, we propose a one-stage method: \\textbf{CasualHDRSplat} to easily and robustly reconstruct the 3D HDR scene from casually captured videos with auto-exposure enabled, even in the presence of severe motion blur and varying unknown exposure time. \\textbf{CasualHDRSplat} contains a unified differentiable physical imaging model which first applies continuous-time trajectory constraint to imaging process so that we can jointly optimize exposure time, camera response function (CRF), camera poses, and sharp 3D HDR scene.

To address this gap, we construct FMNV, a novel dataset exclusively composed of news videos published by media organizations. Through empirical analysis of existing datasets and our curated collection, we categorize fake news videos into four distinct types. Building upon this taxonomy, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate deceptive content by manipulating authentic media-published news videos. Furthermore, we propose FMNVD, a baseline model featuring a dual-stream architecture integrating CLIP and Faster R-CNN for video feature extraction, enhanced by co-attention mechanisms for feature refinement and multimodal aggregation. Comparative experiments demonstrate both the generalization capability of FMNV across multiple baselines and the superior detection efficacy of FMNVD.

MMLA comprises over 61K multimodal utterances drawn from both staged and real-world scenarios, covering six core dimensions of multimodal semantics: intent, emotion, dialogue act, sentiment, speaking style, and communication behavior. We evaluate eight mainstream branches of LLMs and MLLMs using three methods: zero-shot inference, supervised fine-tuning, and instruction tuning. Extensive experiments reveal that even fine-tuned models achieve only about 60%~70% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current MLLMs in understanding complex human language.

    "summary": "We consider dynamical models given by rational ODE systems. Parameter estimation is an important and challenging task of recovering parameter values from observed data. Recently, a method based on differential algebra and rational interpolation was proposed to express parameter estimation in terms of polynomial system solving. Typically, polynomial system solving is a bottleneck, hence the choice of the polynomial solver is crucial. In this contribution, we compare two polynomial system solvers applied to parameter estimation: homotopy continuation solver from this http URL and our new implementation of a certified solver based on rational univariate representation (RUR) and real root isolation. We show how the new RUR solver can tackle examples that are out of reach for the homotopy methods and vice versa.",

    "summary": "Nonlinear spectral problems arise across a range of fields, including mechanical vibrations, fluid-solid interactions, and photonic crystals. Discretizing infinite-dimensional nonlinear spectral problems often introduces significant computational challenges, particularly spectral pollution and invisibility, which can distort or obscure the true underlying spectrum. We present the first general, convergent computational method for computing the spectra and pseudospectra of nonlinear spectral problems. Our approach uses new results on nonlinear injection moduli and requires only minimal continuity assumptions: specifically, continuity with respect to the gap metric on operator graphs, making it applicable to a broad class of problems. We use the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) hierarchy, which has recently been used to resolve the classical linear problem, to systematically classify the computational complexity of nonlinear spectral problems. Our results establish the optimality of the method and reveal that Hermiticity does not necessarily simplify the computational complexity of these nonlinear problems. Comprehensive examples -- including nonlinear shifts, Klein--Gordon equations, wave equations with acoustic boundary conditions, time-fractional beam equations, and biologically inspired delay differential equations -- demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and broad applicability of our methodology.",

The medium above the surface is supposed to be filled with a homogeneous compressible inviscid air/fluid of constant mass density, while the elastic body is assumed to be isotropic and linear. By introducing the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operators for acoustic and elastic waves simultaneously, the model is formulated as an acoustic-elastic interaction problem in periodic structures. Based on a duality argument, an a posteriori error estimate is derived for the associated truncated finite element approximation. The a posteriori error estimate consists of the finite element approximation error and the truncation error of two different DtN operators, where the latter decays exponentially with respect to the truncation parameter. Based on the a posteriori error, an adaptive finite element algorithm is proposed for solving the acoustic-elastic interaction problem in periodic structures.

These maps enhance model interpretability and, when physical laws are unknown, allow for the identification of relevant mechanisms through feature ranking.

We study the minimisation of such relaxed maps via coordinate descents with gradient-based rules, placing a special emphasis on coordinate directions verifying a maximum-alignment property in the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces related to the underlying positive-semidefinite matrices.

Partial differential equations involving both processes arise for instance in atmospheric circulation models. Through a truncation error analysis, we show that previously formulated semi-Lagrangian exponential schemes are limited to first-order accuracy due to the approximation of the integration factor acting on the discretization of the linear term; we then formulate a new discretization leading to second-order accuracy. Also, a detailed stability study is conducted to compare several Eulerian and semi-Lagrangian exponential schemes, as well as a well-established semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit method, which is used in operational atmospheric models. Numerical simulations of the shallow-water equations on the rotating sphere are performed to assess the orders of convergence, stability properties, and computational cost of each method. The proposed second-order semi-Lagrangian exponential method was shown to be more stable and accurate than the previously formulated schemes of the same class at the expense of larger wall-clock times; however, the method is more stable and has a similar cost compared to the well-established semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit method; therefore, it is a competitive candidate for potential operational applications in atmospheric circulation modeling.",

Our integration algorithm also enjoys nearly optimal bound for weighted Korobov space. Furthermore, the algorithm can be applied without the need for prior knowledge of weights, distinguishing it from the component-by-component algorithm.

We show that when the coefficient matrix is diagonalizable, if the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix are clustered, the upper bound of the convergence curve shows superlinear convergence, when the norm of the matrix obtained by decomposing the right hand side vector into the eigenvector components is not so large.

This function acts as a spectral filter, connecting the integration error to arithmetic properties such as k/P and geometric phase cancellation, visualized as vector averaging on the unit circle. We introduce the Resonance Bias Framework (RBF), a generalization to arbitrary smooth periodic functions, leading to the error representation B_P[f] = sum_{k != 0} c_k chi_P(k/P). Although this is mathematically equivalent to the classical aliasing sum, it reveals a deeper mechanism: the quadrature error arises from structured resonance rather than random aliasing noise. The RBF thus provides an interpretable framework for understanding integration errors at finite resolution, grounded in number theory and geometry.",

Underlying the tubal tensor framework is a view of a tensor as a matrix of finite sized tubes. In this work, we lay the mathematical and computational foundations for working with tensors with infinite size tubes: matrices whose elements are elements from a separable Hilbert space. A key challenge is that existence of important desired matrix-mimetic features of tubal tensors rely on the existence of a unit element in the ring of tubes. Such unit element cannot exist for tubes which are elements of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. We sidestep this issue by embedding the tubal space in a commutative unital C*-algebra of bounded operators. The resulting quasitubal algebra recovers the structural properties needed for decomposition and low-rank approximation. In addition to laying the theoretical groundwork for working with tubal tensors with infinite dimensional tubes, we discuss computational aspects of our construction, and provide a numerical illustration where we compute a finite dimensional approximation to a infinitely-sized synthetic tensor using our theory. We believe our theory opens new exciting avenues for applying matrix mimetic tensor framework in the context of inherently infinite dimensional problems.",

Any additive update of $z$ then leads to the desired convergence.

We further generalise the previous results on radial updates to a wide class of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms beyond the HMC and we quantify the convergence behaviour of MCMC algorithms with badly chosen radial update. Finally, we apply the radial update to the sampling of heavy-tailed distributions and achieve a speed up of many orders of magnitude.",

    "summary": "Diffuse domain methods (DDMs) have garnered significant attention for approximating solutions to partial differential equations on complex geometries. These methods implicitly represent the geometry by replacing the sharp boundary interface with a diffuse layer of thickness $\\varepsilon$, which scales with the minimum grid size. This approach reformulates the original equations on an extended regular domain, incorporating boundary conditions through singular source terms. In this work, we conduct a matched asymptotic analysis of a DDM for a two-sided problem with transmission-type Robin boundary conditions. Our results show that, in the one dimensional space, the solution of the diffuse domain approximation asymptotically converges to the solution of the original problem, with exactly first-order accuracy in $\\varepsilon$. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations that validate and illustrate the analytical result.",

Our approach formulates the policy evaluation problem as solving a partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) for the value function with unknown coefficients. A key challenge in this setting is accurately recovering the unknown coefficients in the stochastic dynamics, particularly when driven by Lévy processes with heavy tail effects. To address this, we propose a robust numerical approach that effectively handles both unbiased and censored trajectory datasets. This method combines maximum likelihood estimation with an iterative tail correction mechanism, improving the stability and accuracy of coefficient recovery. Additionally, we establish a theoretical bound for the policy evaluation error based on coefficient recovery error. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method in recovering heavy-tailed Lévy dynamics and verify the theoretical error analysis in policy evaluation.",

    "summary": "Characteristics of an evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithm can be explained using its best solution set. For example, the best solution set for SMS-EMOA is the same as the optimal distribution of solutions for hypervolume maximization. For NSGA-III, if the Pareto front has intersection points with all reference lines, all of those intersection points are the best solution set. For MOEA/D, the best solution set is the set of the optimal solution of each sub-problem. Whereas these EMO algorithms can be analyzed in this manner, the best solution set for the most well-known and frequently-used EMO algorithm NSGA-II has not been discussed in the literature. This is because NSGA-II is not based on any clear criterion to be optimized (e.g., hypervolume maximization, distance minimization to the nearest reference line). As the first step toward the best solution set analysis for NSGA-II, we discuss the optimal distribution of solutions for the crowding distance under the simplest setting: the maximization of the minimum crowding distance on linear Pareto fronts of two-objective optimization problems. That is, we discuss the optimal distribution of solutions on a straight line. Our theoretical analysis shows that the uniformly distributed solutions are not the best solution set. However, it is also shown by computational experiments that the uniformly distributed solutions (except for the duplicated two extreme solutions at each edge of the Pareto front) are obtained from a modified NSGA-II with the ($\\mu$ + 1) generation update scheme.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces an enhanced Genetic Algorithm technique called Dual-Individual Genetic Algorithm (Dual-Individual GA), which optimizes neural networks for binary image classification tasks, such as cat vs. non-cat classification. The proposed method employs only two individuals for crossover, represented by two parameter sets: Leader and Follower. The Leader focuses on exploitation, representing the primary optimal solution at even-indexed positions (0, 2, 4, ...), while the Follower promotes exploration by preserving diversity and avoiding premature convergence, operating at odd-indexed positions (1, 3, 5, ...). Leader and Follower are modeled as two phases or roles. The key contributions of this work are threefold: (1) a self-adaptive layer dimension mechanism that eliminates the need for manual tuning of layer architectures; (2) generates two parameter sets, leader and follower parameter sets, with 10 layer architecture configurations (5 for each set), ranked by Pareto dominance and cost. post-optimization; and (3) demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional gradient-based methods. Experimental results show that the Dual-Individual GA achieves 99.04% training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.034) on a three-layer network with architecture [12288, 17, 4, 1], outperforming a gradient-based approach that achieves 98% training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.092) on a four-layer network with architecture [12288, 20, 7, 5, 1]. These findings highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in optimizing neural networks.",

To address this issue, we propose a simple and efficient approach to extend Bayesian optimization to large-scale batch evaluation in this work. Different from existing batch approaches, the idea of the new approach is to draw a batch of axis-aligned subspaces of the original problem and select one acquisition point from each subspace. To achieve this, we propose the expected subspace improvement criterion to measure the amount of the improvement that a candidate point can achieve within a certain axis-aligned subspace. By optimizing these expected subspace improvement functions simultaneously, we can get a batch of query points for parallel evaluation. Numerical experiments show that our proposed approach can speedup the convergence significantly when compared with the sequential Bayesian optimization algorithm, and performs very competitively when compared with seven batch Bayesian optimization algorithms.

To address this, load-balancing techniques are employed in software-defined networks. Controller load balancing can be categorized into two main approaches: (1) single-level thresholds and (2) multi-level thresholds. However, previous studies have predominantly relied on single-level thresholds, which result in an imprecise classification of controllers or have assumed uniform controller capacities in multi-level threshold methods. This study explores controller load balancing with a focus on utilizing multi-level thresholds to accurately assess controller status. Switch migration operations are utilized to achieve load balancing, considering factors such as the degree of load imbalance of the target controller and migration efficiency. This includes evaluating the post-migration status of the target controller and the distance between the migrating switch and the target controller to select the appropriate target controller and migrating switch. The proposed scheme reduces controller response time, migration costs, communication overhead, and throughput rate. Results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms others regarding response time and overall performance.",

Since traffic is characterized by high dynamicity and diverse access requirements, MOON uses network slicing to provide quality of service (QoS) aware wavelength allocation to fulfill the various applications traffic demands. MOON incorporates hybrid optical switching (HOS) combining optical circuit switching (OCS) and optical time slotted switching (OTS) capabilities that appropriately maps different traffic types to them. Specifically, the OCS network slice explicitly serves aggregated traffic of long duration and high volume, while OTS network slice serves short bursty traffic. In order to provide flexibility, separate sets of wavelengths are used for OCS and OTS traffic service, both within a metro-access network (MAN) (intra-MAN) and between different MANs (inter-MAN). We extensively study the required number of wavelengths to efficiently serve OCS and OTS traffic for intra- and inter-MAN communication scenarios, taking into account their specific traffic access requirements in an effort to optimize wavelengths utilization. In our study, we assume nonblocking OCS communication for immediate access; therefore the number of required OCS wavelengths depends only on the number of nodes, while the number of required OTS wavelengths to obtain a desired QoS and latency level is independent from the number for OCS wavelengths. Simulation results show that within an OTS intra-MAN we achieve end-to-end (E2E) latency in submilliseconds scale, suitable for dynamic bursty traffic, while it is an decreasing function of the number of used OTS wavelengths.",

    "summary": "O-RAN (Open-Radio Access Network) offers a flexible, open architecture for next-generation wireless networks. Network slicing within O-RAN allows network operators to create customized virtual networks, each tailored to meet the specific needs of a particular application or service. Efficiently managing these slices is crucial for future 6G networks. O-RAN introduces specialized software applications called xApps that manage different network functions. In network slicing, an xApp can be responsible for managing a separate network slice. To optimize resource allocation across numerous network slices, these xApps must coordinate. Traditional methods where all xApps communicate freely can lead to excessive overhead, hindering network performance. In this paper, we address the issue of xApp conflict mitigation by proposing an innovative Zero-Touch Management (ZTM) solution for radio resource management in O-RAN. Our approach leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to enable xApps to learn and optimize resource allocation without the need for constant manual intervention. We introduce a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based attention mechanism to streamline communication among xApps, reducing overhead and improving overall system efficiency. Our results compare traditional MARL, where all xApps communicate, against our MARL GCN-based attention method. The findings demonstrate the superiority of our approach, especially as the number of xApps increases, ultimately providing a scalable and efficient solution for optimal network slicing management in O-RAN.",

    "summary": "A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a network that does not rely on a fixed infrastructure and consists of numerous sensors, such as temperature, humidity, GPS, and cameras, equipped with onboard processors that manage and monitor the environment in a specific area. As a result, building a real sensor network testbed for verifying, validating, or experimenting with a newly designed protocol presents considerable challenges in adapting a laboratory scenario due to the significant financial and logistical barriers, such as the need for specialized hardware and large-scale deployments. Additionally, WSN suffers from severe constraints such as restricted power supply, short communication range, limited bandwidth availability, and restricted memory storage. Addressing these challenges, this work presents a flexible testbed solution named STGen that enables researchers to experiment with IoT protocols in a hybrid environment that emulates WSN implementations with the physical Internet through a dedicated physical server named STGen core, which receives sensor traffic and processes it for further actions. The STGen testbed is lightweight in memory usage and easy to deploy. Most importantly, STGen supports large-scale distributed systems, facilitates experimentation with IoT protocols, and enables integration with back-end services for big data analytics and statistical insights. The key feature of STGen is the integration of real-world IoT protocols and their applications with WSN. Its modular and lightweight design makes STGen efficient and enables it to outperform other popular testbeds, such as Gotham and GothX, reducing memory usage by 89\\%. While GothX takes approximately 26 minutes to establish a large topology with four VM nodes and 498 Docker nodes, STGen requires only 1.645 seconds to initialize the platform with 500 sensor nodes.",

Designing secure and efficient peer-to-peer (p2p) networking protocols at these scales to support the tight demands of the upper layer crypto-economic primitives is a highly non-trivial endeavor. We identify decentralized, uniform random sampling of nodes as a fundamental capability necessary for building robust p2p networks in emerging blockchain networks. Sampling algorithms used in practice today (primarily for address discovery) rely on either distributed hash tables (e.g., Kademlia) or sharing addresses with neighbors (e.g., GossipSub), and are not secure in a Sybil setting. We present Honeybee, a decentralized algorithm for sampling nodes that uses verifiable random walks and table consistency checks. Honeybee is secure against attacks even in the presence of an overwhelming number of Byzantine nodes (e.g., $\\geq50\\%$ of the network). We evaluate Honeybee through experiments and show that the quality of sampling achieved by Honeybee is significantly better compared to the state-of-the-art.

This process is essentially a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) neighbor discovery process(NDP). In the process, the variety of Bluetooth scan modes caused by the scan interval and scan window settings affects the discovery latency of finder devices finding the tag broadcast packets. To optimize the experience of searching for lost devices, we propose the CPBIS-mechanism, a certain proportion broadcast-intervals screening mechanism that calculates the most suitable two broadcast intervals and their proportion for offline tags. This reduces discovery latency in the BLE NDP, improves the discovery success rate, further enhances the user experience. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose a comprehensive solution for configuring the broadcast interval parameters of advertisers in BLE NDP, particularly for configurations involving two or more broadcast intervals. We evaluated the results obtained by CPBIS on the nRF52832 chip. The data shows that the CPBIS-mechanism achieves relatively low discovery latencies for multiple scan modes.",

This study proposes a two-stage approach to capture and analyze these complexities using an extensive dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements collected over six months in a single-floor office at the University of Siegen's Hoelderlinstrasse Campus, Germany. First, we implement a multiple linear regression model that includes traditional propagation metrics (distance, structural walls) and an extension with proposed environmental variables (relative humidity, temperature, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). Using analysis of variance, we demonstrate that adding these environmental factors can reduce unexplained variance by 42.32 percent. Secondly, we examine residual distributions by fitting five candidate probability distributions: Normal, Skew-Normal, Cauchy, Student's t, and Gaussian Mixture Models with one to five components. Our results show that a four-component Gaussian Mixture Model captures the residual heterogeneity of indoor signal propagation most accurately, significantly outperforming single-distribution approaches. Given the push toward ultra-reliable, context-aware communications in 6G networks, our analysis shows that environment-aware modeling can substantially improve LoRaWAN network design in dynamic indoor IoT deployments.",

    "summary": "Using correct design metrics and understanding the limitations of the underlying technology is critical to developing effective scheduling algorithms. Unfortunately, existing scheduling techniques used \\emph{incorrect} metrics and had \\emph{unrealistic} assumptions for fair scheduling of multi-tenant FPGAs where each tenant is aimed to share approximately the same number of resources both spatially and temporally.\nThis paper introduces an enhanced fair scheduling algorithm for multi-tenant FPGA use, addressing previous metric and assumption issues, with three specific improvements claimed First, our method ensures spatiotemporal fairness by considering both spatial and temporal aspects, addressing the limitation of prior work that assumed uniform task latency. Second, we incorporate energy considerations into fairness by adjusting scheduling intervals and accounting for energy overhead, thereby balancing energy efficiency with fairness. Third, we acknowledge overlooked aspects of FPGA multi-tenancy, including heterogeneous regions and the constraints on dynamically merging/splitting partially reconfigurable regions. We develop and evaluate our improved fair scheduling algorithm with these three enhancements. Inspired by the Greek goddess of law and personification of justice, we name our fair scheduling solution THEMIS: \\underline{T}ime, \\underline{H}eterogeneity, and \\underline{E}nergy \\underline{Mi}nded \\underline{S}cheduling.\nWe used the Xilinx Zedboard XC7Z020 to quantify our approach's savings. Compared to previous algorithms, our improved scheduling algorithm enhances fairness between 24.2--98.4\\% and allows a trade-off between 55.3$\\times$ in energy vs. 69.3$\\times$ in fairness. The paper thus informs cloud providers about future scheduling optimizations for fairness with related challenges and opportunities.",

Like some others before us, we argue that the assumptions of the DMA-based model are obsolete, and in many use-cases programmed I/O, where the CPU explicitly transfers data and control information to and from a device via loads and stores, delivers a more efficient system.\nHowever, we push this idea much further. We show, in a real hardware implementation, the gains in latency for fine-grained communication achievable using an open cache-coherence protocol which exposes cache transitions to a smart device, and that throughput is competitive with DMA over modern interconnects. We also demonstrate three use-cases: fine-grained RPC-style invocation of functions on an accelerator, offloading of operators in a streaming dataflow engine, and a network interface targeting serverless functions, comparing our use of coherence with both traditional DMA-style interaction and a highly-optimized implementation using memory-mapped programmed I/O over PCIe.",

Relational Hoare logic serves as a powerful tool to establish refinement but often necessitates formalization beyond standard Hoare logic. Particularly in the nondeterministic setting, the $\\forall\\exists$ relational Hoare logic is required. Existing approaches encode this logic into a Hoare logic with ghost states and invariants, yet these extensions significantly increase formalization complexity and soundness proof overhead. This paper proposes a generic encoding theory that reduces the $\\forall\\exists$ relational Hoare logic to standard (unary) Hoare logic. Precisely, we propose to redefine the validity of relational Hoare triples while reserving the original proof rules and then encapsulate the $\\forall\\exists$ pattern within assertions. We have proved that the validity of encoded standard Hoare triples is equivalent to the validity of the desired relational Hoare triples. Moreover, the encoding theory demonstrates how common relational Hoare logic proof rules are indeed special cases of standard Hoare logic proof rules, and relational proof steps correspond to standard proof steps. Our theory enables standard Hoare logic to prove $\\forall\\exists$ relational properties by defining a predicate Exec, without requiring modifications to the logic framework or re-verification of soundness.",

Multi-tier compilation uses light-weight compilers at early stages and highly-optimizing compilers at later stages in order to balance between compilation overheads and code quality.\nWe propose a novel approach to enabling multi-tier compilation in the VMs generated by a meta-compiler framework. Instead of extending the JIT compiler backend of the framework, our approach drives an existing (heavyweight) compiler backend in the framework to quickly generate unoptimized native code by merely embedding directives and compile-time operations into interpreter definitions.\nAs a validation of the approach, we developed 2SOM, a Simple Object Machine with a two-tier JIT compiler based on RPython. 2SOM first applies the tier-1 threaded code generator that is generated by our proposed technique, then, to the loops that exceed a threshold, applies the tier-2 tracing JIT compiler that is generated by the original RPython framework.

Existing approaches primarily rely on context-free thread-local guarantees, and prohibit optimizations that introduce a data-race. However, compilers utilize global context-specific information, exposing safe optimizations that may violate such guarantees as well as introduce a race. Such optimizations need to individually be proven safe for each language model. An alternate approach to this would be proving them safe for an intuitive model (like interleaving semantics), and then determine their portability across other concurrent models. In this paper, we address this problem of porting across models of concurrency. We first identify a global guarantee on optimizations portable from Sequential Consistency (SC) to Total Store Order (TSO). Our guarantee is in the form of constraints specifying the syntactic changes an optimization must not incur. We then show these constraints correlate to prohibiting the introduction of triangular races, a subset of data-race relevant to TSO. We conclude by showing how such race inducing optimizations relate to porting across Strong Release Acquire (SRA), a known causally consistent memory model.",

Second, we propose end-point projection as dependency injection, a design pattern that enables library-level CP in host languages without support for monads.

    "summary": "Robots need task planning methods to achieve goals that require more than individual actions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in task planning. LLMs can generate a step-by-step solution using a description of actions and the goal. Despite the successes in LLM-based task planning, there is limited research studying the security aspects of those systems. In this paper, we develop Robo-Troj, the first multi-trigger backdoor attack for LLM-based task planners, which is the main contribution of this work. As a multi-trigger attack, Robo-Troj is trained to accommodate the diversity of robot application domains. For instance, one can use unique trigger words, e.g., \"herical\", to activate a specific malicious behavior, e.g., cutting hand on a kitchen robot. In addition, we develop an optimization method for selecting the trigger words that are most effective. Through demonstrating the vulnerability of LLM-based planners, we aim to promote the development of secured robot systems.",

    "summary": "In this paper, we present an impedance control framework on the SE(3) manifold, which enables force tracking while guaranteeing passivity. Building upon the unified force-impedance control (UFIC) and our previous work on geometric impedance control (GIC), we develop the geometric unified force impedance control (GUFIC) to account for the SE(3) manifold structure in the controller formulation using a differential geometric perspective. As in the case of the UFIC, the GUFIC utilizes energy tank augmentation for both force-tracking and impedance control to guarantee the manipulator's passivity relative to external forces. This ensures that the end effector maintains safe contact interaction with uncertain environments and tracks a desired interaction force. Moreover, we resolve a non-causal implementation problem in the UFIC formulation by introducing velocity and force fields. Due to its formulation on SE(3), the proposed GUFIC inherits the desirable SE(3) invariance and equivariance properties of the GIC, which helps increase sample efficiency in machine learning applications where a learning algorithm is incorporated into the control law. The proposed control law is validated in a simulation environment under scenarios requiring tracking an SE(3) trajectory, incorporating both position and orientation, while exerting a force on a surface.

By decomposing the system's framework into subframeworks, we express bearing rigidity, a global property, as a set of local properties, with rigidity eigenvalues serving as natural local rigidity metrics. We propose a decentralized, scalable, gradient-based controller that uses only bearing measurements to execute mission-specific commands. The controller preserves bearing rigidity by maintaining rigidity eigenvalues above a threshold, and also avoids inter-robot collisions. Simulations confirm the scheme's effectiveness, with information exchange confined to subframeworks, underscoring its scalability and practicality.",

    "summary": "Accurate and efficient simulation tools are essential in robotics, enabling the visualization of system dynamics and the validation of control laws before committing resources to physical experimentation. Developing physically accurate simulation tools is particularly challenging in soft robotics, largely due to the prevalence of geometrically nonlinear deformation. A variety of robot simulators tackle this challenge by using simplified modeling techniques -- such as lumped mass models -- which lead to physical inaccuracies in real-world applications. On the other hand, high-fidelity simulation methods for soft structures, like finite element analysis, offer increased accuracy but lead to higher computational costs. In light of this, we present a Discrete Differential Geometry-based simulator that provides a balance between physical accuracy and computational speed. Building on an extensive body of research on rod and shell-based representations of soft robots, our tool provides a pathway to accurately model soft robots in a computationally tractable manner. Our open-source MATLAB-based framework is capable of simulating the deformations of rods, shells, and their combinations, primarily utilizing implicit integration techniques. The software design is modular for the user to customize the code, for example, add new external forces and impose custom boundary conditions. The implementations for prevalent forces encountered in robotics, including gravity, contact, kinetic and viscous friction, and aerodynamic drag, have been provided. We provide several illustrative examples that showcase the capabilities and validate the physical accuracy of the simulator. The open-source code is available at this https URL. We anticipate that the proposed simulator can serve as an effective digital twin tool, enhancing the Sim2Real pathway in soft robotics research.",

    "summary": "Learning grinding skills from human craftsmen via imitation learning has become a key research topic in robotic machining. Due to their strong generalization and robustness to external disturbances, Dynamical Movement Primitives (DMPs) offer a promising approach for robotic grinding skill learning. However, directly applying DMPs to grinding tasks faces challenges, such as low orientation accuracy, unsynchronized position-orientation-force, and limited generalization for surface trajectories. To address these issues, this paper proposes a robotic grinding skill learning method based on geodesic length DMPs (Geo-DMPs). First, a normalized 2D weighted Gaussian kernel and intrinsic mean clustering algorithm are developed to extract geometric features from multiple demonstrations. Then, an orientation manifold distance metric removes the time dependency in traditional orientation DMPs, enabling accurate orientation learning via Geo-DMPs. A synchronization encoding framework is further proposed to jointly model position, orientation, and force using a geodesic length-based phase function. This framework enables robotic grinding actions to be generated between any two surface points. Experiments on robotic chamfer grinding and free-form surface grinding validate that the proposed method achieves high geometric accuracy and generalization in skill encoding and generation. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use DMPs for jointly learning and generating grinding skills in position, orientation, and force on model-free surfaces, offering a novel path for robotic grinding.",

    "summary": "Despite significant interest and advancements in humanoid robotics, most existing commercially available hardware remains high-cost, closed-source, and non-transparent within the robotics community. This lack of accessibility and customization hinders the growth of the field and the broader development of humanoid technologies. To address these challenges and promote democratization in humanoid robotics, we demonstrate Berkeley Humanoid Lite, an open-source humanoid robot designed to be accessible, customizable, and beneficial for the entire community. The core of this design is a modular 3D-printed gearbox for the actuators and robot body. All components can be sourced from widely available e-commerce platforms and fabricated using standard desktop 3D printers, keeping the total hardware cost under $5,000 (based on U.S. market prices). The design emphasizes modularity and ease of fabrication. To address the inherent limitations of 3D-printed gearboxes, such as reduced strength and durability compared to metal alternatives, we adopted a cycloidal gear design, which provides an optimal form factor in this context. Extensive testing was conducted on the 3D-printed actuators to validate their durability and alleviate concerns about the reliability of plastic components. To demonstrate the capabilities of Berkeley Humanoid Lite, we conducted a series of experiments, including the development of a locomotion controller using reinforcement learning. These experiments successfully showcased zero-shot policy transfer from simulation to hardware, highlighting the platform's suitability for research validation. By fully open-sourcing the hardware design, embedded code, and training and deployment frameworks, we aim for Berkeley Humanoid Lite to serve as a pivotal step toward democratizing the development of humanoid robotics.

Specifically, leveraging statistical theory, we develop an asymptotically unbiased and $\\sqrt {n}$-consistent PnP estimator that accounts for varying 3D triangulation uncertainties, ensuring that the relative pose estimate converges to the ground truth as the number of features increases. Next, on the stereo VO pipeline side, we propose a framework that continuously triangulates contemporary features for tracking new frames, effectively decoupling temporal dependencies between pose and 3D point errors. We integrate the Bias-Eli-W PnP estimator into the proposed stereo VO pipeline, creating a synergistic effect that enhances the suppression of pose estimation errors. We validate the performance of our method on the KITTI and Oxford RobotCar datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method: 1) achieves significant improvements in both relative pose error and absolute trajectory error in large-scale environments; 2) provides reliable localization under erratic and unpredictable robot motions. The successful implementation of the Bias-Eli-W PnP in stereo VO indicates the importance of information screening in robotic estimation tasks with high-uncertainty measurements, shedding light on diverse applications where PnP is a key ingredient.",

Pose estimation methods using Neural Networks (NN) based on an RGBD camera are highly accurate, but their accuracy significantly decreases when the camera acquires few texture and shape features at a current view point. However, it is difficult for previous mathematical model-based methods to estimate effective NV which is because the simple shaped objects have few shape features. Therefore, we focus on the relationship between the pose estimation and NV estimation. When the pose estimation is more accurate, the NV estimation is more accurate. Therefore, we develop a new pose estimation NN that estimates NV simultaneously. Experimental results showed that our NV estimation realized a pose estimation success rate 77.3\\%, which was 7.4pt higher than the mathematical model-based NV calculation did. Moreover, we verified that the robot using our method displayed 84.2\\% of products.",

This paper introduces a complete LiDAR-based system designed to enable UAVs to avoid various moving obstacles in complex environments. Benefiting the high computational efficiency of perception and planning, the system can operate in real time using onboard computing resources with low latency. For dynamic environment perception, we have integrated our previous work, M-detector, into the system. M-detector ensures that moving objects of different sizes, colors, and types are reliably detected. For dynamic environment planning, we incorporate dynamic object predictions into the integrated planning and control (IPC) framework, namely DynIPC. This integration allows the UAV to utilize predictions about dynamic obstacles to effectively evade them. We validate our proposed system through both simulations and real-world experiments. In simulation tests, our system outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across several metrics, including success rate, time consumption, average flight time, and maximum velocity. In real-world trials, our system successfully navigates through forests, avoiding moving obstacles along its path.",

Instead of relying solely on SLAM-based localization, we align ``as-built\" detected planes from the real-world environment with ``as-planned\" architectural planes in BIM. Our method performs robust plane matching and computes a transformation (TF) between SLAM (S) and BIM (B) origin frames using optimization techniques, minimizing drift over time. By incorporating BIM as prior structural knowledge, we can achieve improved long-term localization and enhanced AR visualization accuracy in noisy construction environments. The method is evaluated through real-world experiments, showing significant reductions in drift-induced errors and optimized alignment consistency. On average, our system achieves a reduction of 52.24% in angular deviations and a reduction of 60.8% in the distance error of the matched walls compared to the initial manual alignment by the user.",

    "summary": "Bimanual manipulation is a challenging yet crucial robotic capability, demanding precise spatial localization and versatile motion trajectories, which pose significant challenges to existing approaches. Existing approaches fall into two categories: keyframe-based strategies, which predict gripper poses in keyframes and execute them via motion planners, and continuous control methods, which estimate actions sequentially at each timestep. The keyframe-based method lacks inter-frame supervision, struggling to perform consistently or execute curved motions, while the continuous method suffers from weaker spatial perception. To address these issues, this paper introduces an end-to-end framework PPI (keyPose and Pointflow Interface), which integrates the prediction of target gripper poses and object pointflow with the continuous actions estimation. These interfaces enable the model to effectively attend to the target manipulation area, while the overall framework guides diverse and collision-free trajectories. By combining interface predictions with continuous actions estimation, PPI demonstrates superior performance in diverse bimanual manipulation tasks, providing enhanced spatial localization and satisfying flexibility in handling movement restrictions.

    "summary": "With the growing popularity of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach decision-making problems and create new opportunities for human-AI collaboration. In this article, we introduce a novel multi-layered hierarchical HITL DRL algorithm that comprises three types of learning: self learning, imitation learning and transfer learning. In addition, we consider three forms of human inputs: reward, action and demonstration. Furthermore, we discuss main challenges, trade-offs and advantages of HITL in solving complex problems and how human information can be integrated in the AI solution systematically. To verify our technical results, we present a real-world unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) problem wherein a number of enemy drones attack a restricted area. The objective is to design a scalable HITL DRL algorithm for ally drones to neutralize the enemy drones before they reach the area. To this end, we first implement our solution using an award-winning open-source HITL software called Cogment. We then demonstrate several interesting results such as (a) HITL leads to faster training and higher performance, (b) advice acts as a guiding direction for gradient methods and lowers variance, and (c) the amount of advice should neither be too large nor too small to avoid over-training and under-training. Finally, we illustrate the role of human-AI cooperation in solving two real-world complex scenarios, i.e., overloaded and decoy attacks.",

    "summary": "Human-robot interactions can be modeled as incomplete-information general-sum dynamic games since the objective functions of both agents are not explicitly known to each other. However, solving for equilibrium policies for such games presents a major challenge, especially if the games involve nonlinear underlying dynamics. To simplify the problem, existing work often assumes that one agent is an expert with complete information about its peer, which can lead to biased estimates and failures in coordination. To address this challenge, we propose a nonlinear peer-aware cost estimation (N-PACE) algorithm for general-sum dynamic games. In N-PACE, using iterative linear quadratic (LQ) approximation of the nonlinear general-sum game, each agent explicitly models the learning dynamics of its peer agent while inferring their objective functions, leading to unbiased fast learning in inferring the unknown objective function of the peer agent, which is critical for task completion and safety assurance. Additionally, we demonstrate how N-PACE enables \\textbf{intent communication} in such multi-agent systems by explicitly modeling the peer's learning dynamics.",

    "summary": "Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately detect objects and interpret their surroundings. However, even when trained using millions of miles of real-world data, AVs are often unable to detect rare failure modes (RFMs). The problem of RFMs is commonly referred to as the \"long-tail challenge\", due to the distribution of data including many instances that are very rarely seen. In this paper, we present a novel approach that utilizes advanced generative and explainable AI techniques to aid in understanding RFMs. Our methods can be used to enhance the robustness and reliability of AVs when combined with both downstream model training and testing. We extract segmentation masks for objects of interest (e.g., cars) and invert them to create environmental masks. These masks, combined with carefully crafted text prompts, are fed into a custom diffusion model. We leverage the Stable Diffusion inpainting model guided by adversarial noise optimization to generate images containing diverse environments designed to evade object detection models and expose vulnerabilities in AI systems. Finally, we produce natural language descriptions of the generated RFMs that can guide developers and policymakers to improve the safety and reliability of AV systems.",

Various approaches have been proposed to realize collective perception; however, the Sensor2Sensor domain gap that arises from the utilization of different sensor systems in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) remains mostly unaddressed. This is primarily due to the paucity of datasets containing heterogeneous sensor setups among the CAVs. The recently released SCOPE datasets address this issue by providing data from three different LiDAR sensors for each CAV. This study is the first to tackle the Sensor2Sensor domain gap in vehicle to vehicle (V2V) collective perception. First, we present our sensor-domain robust architecture S2S-Net. Then an in-depth analysis of the Sensor2Sensor domain adaptation capabilities of S2S-Net on the SCOPE dataset is conducted. S2S-Net demonstrates the capability to maintain very high performance in unseen sensor domains and achieved state-of-the-art results on the SCOPE dataset.",

Typically, these controllers generate high-level commands like longitudinal acceleration or force. However, vehicles with combustion engines expect different actuation inputs. This paper proposes a longitudinal control concept that translates high-level trajectory-tracking commands to the required low-level vehicle commands such as throttle, brake pressure and a desired gear. We chose a modular structure to easily integrate different trajectory-tracking control algorithms and vehicles. The proposed control concept enables a close tracking of the high-level control command. An anti-lock braking system, traction control, and brake warmup control also ensure a safe operation during real-world tests. We provide experimental validation of our concept using real world data with longitudinal accelerations reaching up to $25 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{s}^2}$.

It contrasts with the common practice of operating at the level of objects, where vanilla DDPMs are currently used. In this work, we close the gap between these two lines of work. We identify approximations in the local diffusion formulation, show that they are not required to operate at the scene level, and that a vanilla DDPM with a well-chosen starting point is enough for completion.

To approximate this posterior, this work frames an optimization problem in the space of Gaussian distributions by solving a Variational Inference (VI) in the path distribution space. For linear-Gaussian stochastic dynamics, we propose a proximal algorithm to solve for an optimal Gaussian proposal iteratively. The computational bottleneck is evaluating the gradients with respect to the proposal over a dense trajectory. We exploit the sparse motion planning factor graph and Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP), allowing for parallel computing of these gradients on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). We term the novel paradigm as the Parallel Gaussian Variational Inference Motion Planning (P-GVIMP). Building on the efficient algorithm for linear Gaussian systems, we then propose an iterative paradigm based on Statistical Linear Regression (SLR) techniques to solve motion planning for nonlinear stochastic systems, where the P-GVIMP serves as a sub-routine for the linearized time-varying system. We validate the proposed framework on various robotic systems, demonstrating significant speed acceleration achieved by leveraging parallel computation and successful planning solutions for nonlinear systems under uncertainty.

Our investigation reveals that conventional parameter reduction techniques ultimately impair the performance of the language foundation model during the action instruction tuning phase, making them unsuitable for this purpose. We introduce a novel latency-free quadruped MLLM model, dubbed QUART-Online, designed to enhance inference efficiency without degrading the performance of the language foundation model. By incorporating Action Chunk Discretization (ACD), we compress the original action representation space, mapping continuous action values onto a smaller set of discrete representative vectors while preserving critical information. Subsequently, we fine-tune the MLLM to integrate vision, language, and compressed actions into a unified semantic space. Experimental results demonstrate that QUART-Online operates in tandem with the existing MLLM system, achieving real-time inference in sync with the underlying controller frequency, significantly boosting the success rate across various tasks by 65%.

Many depth sensing (or RGB-D) cameras are available on the market and selecting the best one for your application can be challenging. In this work, we tested four stereoscopic RGB-D cameras that sense the distance by using two images from slightly different views. We empirically compared four cameras (Intel RealSense D435, Intel RealSense D455, StereoLabs ZED 2, and Luxonis OAK-D Pro) in three scenarios: (i) planar surface perception, (ii) plastic doll perception, (iii) household object perception (YCB dataset). We recorded and evaluated more than 3,000 RGB-D frames for each camera. For table-top robotics scenarios with distance to objects up to one meter, the best performance is provided by the D435 camera that is able to perceive with an error under 1 cm in all of the tested scenarios. For longer distances, the other three models perform better, making them more suitable for some mobile robotics applications. OAK-D Pro additionally offers integrated AI modules (e.g., object and human keypoint detection). ZED 2 is overall the best camera which is able to keep the error under 3 cm even at 4 meters. However, it is not a standalone device and requires a computer with a GPU for depth data acquisition. All data (more than 12,000 RGB-D frames) are publicly available at this https URL.",

In this work, we introduce a novel framework for learning world models that accurately capture complex, partially observable, and stochastic dynamics. The proposed method employs a dual-autoregressive mechanism and self-supervised training to achieve reliable long-horizon predictions without relying on domain-specific inductive biases, ensuring adaptability across diverse robotic tasks. We further propose a policy optimization framework that leverages world models for efficient training in imagined environments and seamless deployment in real-world systems. This work advances model-based reinforcement learning by addressing the challenges of long-horizon prediction, error accumulation, and sim-to-real transfer.

In this work, we demonstrate the system design and algorithmic integration of a visual servoing framework for semantically guided autonomous underwater cave exploration. We present the hardware and edge-AI design considerations to deploy this framework on a novel AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) named CavePI. The guided navigation is driven by a computationally light yet robust deep visual perception module, delivering a rich semantic understanding of the environment. Subsequently, a robust control mechanism enables CavePI to track the semantic guides and navigate within complex cave structures. We evaluate the system through field experiments in natural underwater caves and spring-water sites and further validate its ROS (Robot Operating System)-based digital twin in a simulation environment. Our results highlight how these integrated design choices facilitate reliable navigation under feature-deprived, GPS-denied, and low-visibility conditions.",

Existing high-performing methods remain hard to deploy due to their high computational cost, long training times, and excessive memory requirements. Here, we propose an efficient lane-changing intention prediction approach based on brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). By leveraging the event-driven nature of SNN, the proposed approach enables us to encode the vehicle's states in a more efficient manner. Comparison experiments conducted on HighD and NGSIM datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves training efficiency and reduces deployment costs while maintaining comparable prediction accuracy. Particularly, compared to the baseline, our approach reduces training time by 75% and memory usage by 99.9%. These results validate the efficiency and reliability of our method in lane-changing predictions, highlighting its potential for safe and efficient autonomous driving systems while offering significant advantages in deployment, including reduced training time, lower memory usage, and faster inference.",

    "summary": "In everyday life, we perform tasks (e.g., cooking or cleaning) that involve a large variety of objects and goals. When confronted with an unexpected or unwanted outcome, we take corrective actions and try again until achieving the desired result. The reasoning performed to identify a cause of the observed outcome and to select an appropriate corrective action is a crucial aspect of human reasoning for successful task execution. Central to this reasoning is the assumption that a factor is responsible for producing the observed outcome. In this paper, we investigate the use of probabilistic actual causation to determine whether a factor is the cause of an observed undesired outcome. Furthermore, we show how the actual causation probabilities can be used to find alternative actions to change the outcome. We apply the probabilistic actual causation analysis to a robot pouring task. When spillage occurs, the analysis indicates whether a task parameter is the cause and how it should be changed to avoid spillage. The analysis requires a causal graph of the task and the corresponding conditional probability distributions. To fulfill these requirements, we perform a complete causal modeling procedure (i.e., task analysis, definition of variables, determination of the causal graph structure, and estimation of conditional probability distributions) using data from a realistic simulation of the robot pouring task, covering a large combinatorial space of task parameters. Based on the results, we discuss the implications of the variables' representation and how the alternative actions suggested by the actual causation analysis would compare to the alternative solutions proposed by a human observer. The practical use of the analysis of probabilistic actual causation to select alternative action parameters is demonstrated.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in deep learning and Transformers have driven major breakthroughs in robotics by employing techniques such as imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and LLM-based multimodal perception and decision-making. However, conventional deep learning and Transformer models often struggle to process data with inherent symmetries and invariances, typically relying on large datasets or extensive data augmentation. Equivariant neural networks overcome these limitations by explicitly integrating symmetry and invariance into their architectures, leading to improved efficiency and generalization. This tutorial survey reviews a wide range of equivariant deep learning and control methods for robotics, from classic to state-of-the-art, with a focus on SE(3)-equivariant models that leverage the natural 3D rotational and translational symmetries in visual robotic manipulation and control design. Using unified mathematical notation, we begin by reviewing key concepts from group theory, along with matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. We then introduce foundational group-equivariant neural network design and show how the group-equivariance can be obtained through their structure. Next, we discuss the applications of SE(3)-equivariant neural networks in robotics in terms of imitation learning and reinforcement learning. The SE(3)-equivariant control design is also reviewed from the perspective of geometric control. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions of equivariant methods in developing more robust, sample-efficient, and multi-modal real-world robotic systems.",

    "summary": "Dexterous manipulation, which refers to the ability of a robotic hand or multi-fingered end-effector to skillfully control, reorient, and manipulate objects through precise, coordinated finger movements and adaptive force modulation, enables complex interactions similar to human hand dexterity. With recent advances in robotics and machine learning, there is a growing demand for these systems to operate in complex and unstructured environments. Traditional model-based approaches struggle to generalize across tasks and object variations due to the high dimensionality and complex contact dynamics of dexterous manipulation. Although model-free methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) show promise, they require extensive training, large-scale interaction data, and carefully designed rewards for stability and effectiveness. Imitation learning (IL) offers an alternative by allowing robots to acquire dexterous manipulation skills directly from expert demonstrations, capturing fine-grained coordination and contact dynamics while bypassing the need for explicit modeling and large-scale trial-and-error. This survey provides an overview of dexterous manipulation methods based on imitation learning, details recent advances, and addresses key challenges in the field. Additionally, it explores potential research directions to enhance IL-driven dexterous manipulation. Our goal is to offer researchers and practitioners a comprehensive introduction to this rapidly evolving domain.",

Our approach focuses on few-shot adaptation of residual dynamics - capturing the discrepancy between nominal and true system behavior - using minimal online data and gradient steps. By embedding these meta-learned residual models into a computationally efficient L4CasADi-based MPC pipeline, the proposed method enables rapid model correction, enhances predictive accuracy, and improves real-time control performance. We validate the framework through simulation studies on a Van der Pol oscillator, a Cart-Pole system, and a 2D quadrotor. Results show significant gains in adaptation speed and prediction accuracy over both nominal MPC and nominal MPC augmented with a freshly initialized neural network, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach for real-time adaptive robot control.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces DYNUS, an uncertainty-aware trajectory planner designed for dynamic unknown environments. Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions.\nRecently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times.\nTo address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories.\nWe evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.",

In this paper, we propose a novel concept to generalize symbolic actions using a given entity hierarchy and observed similar behavior. In a simulated grid-based kitchen environment, we show that type-generalized actions can be learned from few observations and generalize to novel situations.

Meanwhile, RL has been widely recognized for its effectiveness in enhancing agent intelligence, but limited research has investigated the fine-tuning of LaMAS using foundational RL techniques. Moreover, the direct application of MARL methodologies to LaMAS introduces significant challenges, stemming from the unique characteristics and mechanisms inherent to LaMAS. To address these challenges, this article presents a comprehensive study of LLM-based MARL and proposes a novel paradigm termed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MARFT). We introduce a universal algorithmic framework tailored for LaMAS, outlining the conceptual foundations, key distinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We begin by reviewing the evolution from RL to Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, setting the stage for a parallel analysis in the multi-agent domain. In the context of LaMAS, we elucidate critical differences between MARL and MARFT. These differences motivate a transition toward a novel, LaMAS-oriented formulation of RFT. Central to this work is the presentation of a robust and scalable MARFT framework. We detail the core algorithm and provide a complete, open-source implementation to facilitate adoption and further research. The latter sections of the paper explore real-world application perspectives and opening challenges in MARFT. By bridging theoretical underpinnings with practical methodologies, this work aims to serve as a roadmap for researchers seeking to advance MARFT toward resilient and adaptive solutions in agentic systems.

Although machine learning has been shown to reduce the required measurement points and, thus, the measurement time, a controlled environment is still necessary. This paper proposes a method to address this constraint by presenting a novel technique that can upsample sparse, noisy HRTF measurements. The proposed approach combines an HRTF Denoisy U-Net for denoising and an Autoencoding Generative Adversarial Network (AE-GAN) for upsampling from three measurement points. The proposed method achieves a log-spectral distortion (LSD) error of 5.41 dB and a cosine similarity loss of 0.0070, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in HRTF upsampling.",

    "summary": "Universal sound separation aims to extract clean audio tracks corresponding to distinct events from mixed audio, which is critical for artificial auditory perception. However, current methods heavily rely on artificially mixed audio for training, which limits their ability to generalize to naturally mixed audio collected in real-world environments. To overcome this limitation, we propose ClearSep, an innovative framework that employs a data engine to decompose complex naturally mixed audio into multiple independent tracks, thereby allowing effective sound separation in real-world scenarios. We introduce two remix-based evaluation metrics to quantitatively assess separation quality and use these metrics as thresholds to iteratively apply the data engine alongside model training, progressively optimizing separation performance. In addition, we propose a series of training strategies tailored to these separated independent tracks to make the best use of them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ClearSep achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple sound separation tasks, highlighting its potential for advancing sound separation in natural audio scenarios.

    "summary": "Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved great success in processing and understanding information from diverse modalities (e.g., text, audio, and visual signals). Despite their growing popularity, there remains a lack of comprehensive evaluation measuring the audio-visual capabilities of these models, especially in diverse scenarios (e.g., distribution shifts and adversarial attacks). In this paper, we present a multifaceted evaluation of the audio-visual capability of MLLMs, focusing on four key dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, generalizability, and robustness. Through extensive experiments, we find that MLLMs exhibit strong zero-shot and few-shot generalization abilities, enabling them to achieve great performance with limited data. However, their success relies heavily on the vision modality, which impairs performance when visual input is corrupted or missing. Additionally, while MLLMs are susceptible to adversarial samples, they demonstrate greater robustness compared to traditional models. The experimental results and our findings provide insights into the audio-visual capabilities of MLLMs, highlighting areas for improvement and offering guidance for future research.",

This problem is known as absolute auditory attention decoding (aAAD). We propose an unsupervised discriminative CCA model for feature extraction and combine it with an unsupervised classifier called minimally informed linear discriminant analysis (MILDA) for aAAD classification. Remarkably, the proposed unsupervised algorithm performs significantly better than a state-of-the-art supervised model. A key reason is that the unsupervised algorithm can successfully adapt to the non-stationary test data at a low computational cost.

This study aims to investigate the relationship between students' interest in contributing to OSS and their perceptions of barriers and motivational factors. We developed a theoretical model to understand the relationship between students' perceptions of OSS and their interest in contributing. We then surveyed students majoring in computer science and related fields (N=241). Using structural equation modeling techniques, we tested the model and found that intrinsic and internalized extrinsic motivations are positively associated with interest in contributing to OSS projects, while the impact of extrinsic motivation varies by gender. Comparatively, we found no significant relationship between barriers and interest in contributing. Students suggested several ways to make projects more attractive, including increasing awareness of the importance of OSS. Our findings can help communities better prepare to integrate students and encourage educators to enhance interest in OSS by linking participation to specific motivational factors.",

RuleLLM extracts metadata and code snippets from malware as its input, producing YARA and Semgrep rules that can be directly deployed in software development. Specifically, the rule generation task involves three subtasks: crafting rules, refining rules, and aligning rules. To validate RuleLLM's effectiveness, we implemented a prototype system and conducted experiments on the dataset of 1,633 malicious packages. The results are promising that RuleLLM generated 763 rules (452 YARA and 311 Semgrep) with a precision of 85.2\\% and a recall of 91.8\\%, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) tools and scored-based approaches.

    "summary": "In API testing, deriving logical constraints on API response bodies is crucial in generating the test cases to cover various aspects of RESTful APIs. However, existing approaches are limited to dynamic analysis in which constraints are extracted from the execution of APIs as part of the system under test. The key limitation of such a dynamic approach is its under-estimation in which inputs in API executions are not sufficiently diverse to uncover actual constraints on API response bodies. In this paper, we propose to combine a novel static analysis approach (in which the constraints for API response bodies are mined from API specifications), with the dynamic approach (which relies on API execution data). We leverage large language models (LLMs) to comprehend the API specifications, mine constraints for response bodies, and generate test cases. To reduce LLMs' hallucination, we apply an Observation-Confirmation (OC) scheme which uses initial prompts to contextualize constraints. %, allowing subsequent prompts to more accurately confirm their presence. Our empirical results show that~LLMs with OC prompting achieve high precision in constraint mining with the average of 91.2%. When combining static and dynamic analysis, our tool, RBCTest , achieves a precision of 78.5%. RBCTest detects 107 constraints that the dynamic approach misses and 46 more precise constraints. We also use its generated test cases to detect 21 mismatches between the API specification and actual response data for 8 real-world APIs. Four of the mismatches were, in fact, reported in developers' forums.",

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable program comprehension capabilities, while transformer-based topic modeling techniques offer effective ways to extract semantic information from text. This paper proposes and explores a novel approach that combines these strengths to automatically identify meaningful topics in a corpus of Python programs. Our method consists in applying topic modeling on the descriptions obtained by asking an LLM to summarize the code. To assess the internal consistency of the extracted topics, we compare them against topics inferred from function names alone, and those derived from existing docstrings. Experimental results suggest that leveraging LLM-generated summaries provides interpretable and semantically rich representation of code structure. The promising results suggest that our approach can be fruitfully applied in various software engineering tasks such as automatic documentation and tagging, code search, software reorganization and knowledge discovery in large repositories.",

    "summary": "Context: Previous research on software aging is limited with focus on dynamic runtime indicators like memory and performance, often neglecting evolutionary indicators like source code comments and narrowly examining legacy issues within the TD context. Objective: We introduce the concept of Aging Debt (AD), representing the increased maintenance efforts and costs needed to keep software updated. We study AD through Self-Admitted Aging Debt (SAAD) observed in source code comments left by software developers. Method: We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analyses to detect and measure AD in software. This includes framing SAAD patterns from the source code comments after analysing the source code context, then utilizing the SAAD patterns to detect SAAD comments. In the process, we develop a taxonomy for SAAD that reflects the temporal aging of software and its associated debt. Then we utilize the taxonomy to quantify the different types of AD prevalent in OSS repositories. Results: Our proposed taxonomy categorizes temporal software aging into Active and Dormant types. Our extensive analysis of over 9,000+ Open Source Software (OSS) repositories reveals that more than 21% repositories exhibit signs of SAAD as observed from our gold standard SAAD dataset. Notably, Dormant AD emerges as the predominant category, highlighting a critical but often overlooked aspect of software maintenance. Conclusion: As software volume grows annually, so do evolutionary aging and maintenance challenges; our proposed taxonomy can aid researchers in detailed software aging studies and help practitioners develop improved and proactive maintenance strategies.",

Our analysis reveals a new breed of supply chain attack that manipulates software engineering practices themselves -- from community management to CI/CD configurations -- to establish legitimacy and maintain long-term control. Through a comprehensive examination of GitHub events and development artifacts, we reconstruct the attack timeline, analyze the evolution of attacker tactics. Our findings demonstrate how attackers leveraged seemingly beneficial contributions to project infrastructure and maintenance to bypass traditional security measures.

While it is recognized as important in traditional software teams, its role in open-source development remains understudied. Yet, open-source contributors often collaborate without formal roles or structures, where interpersonal relationship can make or break participation. In this study, we examine whether team-level psychological safety, inferred from code review activities, is associated with contributors' continued participation in open-source projects. Code review is a central and collaborative activity in modern software development, which offers a rich context for observing team interactions. Based on 60,684 pull requests, we construct a psychological safety index using cues such as merge decisions, comment activity, interaction diversity, and mentions. We analyze its relationship with contributors' short-term (after 1 year) and long-term (after 4-5 years) sustained participation using three logistic regression models. Our findings show that contributors are more likely to remain active in repositories with higher levels of psychological safety. Psychological safety is positively associated with both short-term and future sustained participation. However, when prior participation is included, it becomes the stronger predictor of future sustained participation, while the effect of psychological safety becomes smaller. This study introduces a scalable approach to study psychological safety through pull request data and provides new evidence that it matters in open-source development.",

    "summary": "How can we perform concolic execution to generate highly structured test inputs for systematically testing parsing programs? Existing concolic execution engines are significantly restricted by (1) input structure-agnostic path constraint selection, leading to the waste of testing effort or missing coverage; (2) limited constraint-solving capability, yielding many syntactically invalid test inputs; (3) reliance on manual acquisition of highly structured seed inputs, resulting in non-continuous testing.\nThis paper proposes Cottontail, a new Large Language Model (LLM)-driven concolic execution engine, to mitigate the above limitations. A more complete program path representation, named Expressive Structural Coverage Tree (ESCT), is first constructed to select structure-aware path constraints. Later, an LLM-driven constraint solver based on a Solve-Complete paradigm is designed to solve the path constraints smartly to get test inputs that are not only satisfiable to the constraints but also valid to the input syntax. Finally, a history-guided seed acquisition is employed to obtain new highly structured test inputs either before testing starts or after testing is saturated.\nWe implemented Cottontail on top of SymCC and evaluated eight extensively tested open-source libraries across four different formats (XML, SQL, JavaScript, and JSON). The experimental result is promising: it shows that Cottontail outperforms state-of-the-art approaches (SymCC and Marco) by 14.15% and 14.31% in terms of line coverage. Besides, Cottontail found 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities (six new CVEs have been assigned). We have reported these issues to developers, and 4 out of them have been fixed so far.",

    "summary": "Software development is a collaborative task involving diverse development teams, where toxic communication can negatively impact team mood and project success. Mood surveys enable the early detection of underlying tensions or dissatisfaction within development teams, allowing communication issues to be addressed before they escalate, fostering a positive and productive work environment. The mood can be surveyed indirectly by analyzing the text-based communication of the team. However, emotional subjectivity leads to varying sentiment interpretations across team members; a statement perceived neutrally by one developer might be seen as problematic by another developer with a different conversational culture. Early identification of perception volatility can help prevent misunderstandings and enhance team morale while safeguarding the project. This paper analyzes the diversity of perceptions within arbitrary development teams and determines how many team members should report their sentiment to accurately reflect the team's mood. Through a Monte Carlo experiment involving 45 developers, we present a preliminary mathematical model to calculate the minimum agreement among a subset of developers based on the whole team's agreement. This model can guide leadership in mood assessment, demonstrating that omitting even a single member in an average-sized 7-member team can misrepresent the overall mood. Therefore, including all developers in mood surveying is recommended to ensure a reliable evaluation of the team's mood.",

    "summary": "Many businesses depend on legacy systems, which often use outdated technology that complicates maintenance and updates. Therefore, software modernization is essential, particularly data migration between different database schemas. Established methodologies, like model transformation and ETL tools, facilitate this migration; they require deep knowledge of database languages and both the source and target schemas. This necessity renders data migration an error-prone and cognitively demanding task. Our objective is to alleviate developers' workloads during schema evolution through our DAMI-Framework. This framework incorporates a domain-specific language (DSL) and a parser to facilitate data migration between database schemas. DAMI-DSL simplifies schema mapping while the parser automates SQL script generation. We assess developer experience in data migration by conducting an empirical evaluation with 21 developers to assess their experiences using our DSL versus traditional SQL. The study allows us to measure their perceptions of the DSL properties and user experience. The participants praised DAMI-DSL for its readability and ease of use. The findings indicate that our DSL reduces data migration efforts compared to SQL scripts.",

    "summary": "Fairness-aware learning aims to mitigate discrimination against specific protected social groups (e.g., those categorized by gender, ethnicity, age) while minimizing predictive performance loss. Despite efforts to improve fairness in machine learning, prior studies have shown that many models remain unfair when measured against various fairness metrics. In this paper, we examine whether the way training and testing data are sampled affects the reliability of reported fairness metrics. Since training and test sets are often randomly sampled from the same population, bias present in the training data may still exist in the test data, potentially skewing fairness assessments. To address this, we propose FairMatch, a post-processing method that applies propensity score matching to evaluate and mitigate bias. FairMatch identifies control and treatment pairs with similar propensity scores in the test set and adjusts decision thresholds for different subgroups accordingly. For samples that cannot be matched, we perform probabilistic calibration using fairness-aware loss functions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can (a) precisely locate subsets of the test data where the model is unbiased, and (b) significantly reduce bias on the remaining data. Overall, propensity score matching offers a principled way to improve both fairness evaluation and mitigation, without sacrificing predictive performance.",

    "summary": "Formal specifications of on-chip communication protocols are crucial for system-on-chip (SoC) design and verification. However, manually constructing these formal specifications from informal documents remains a tedious and error-prone task. Although recent efforts have used Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate SystemVerilog Assertion (SVA) properties from design documents for Register-Transfer Level (RTL) design verification, in our experience these approaches have not shown promise in generating SVA properties for communication protocols. Since protocol specification documents are unstructured and ambiguous in nature, LLMs often fail to extract the necessary information and end up generating irrelevant or even incorrect properties. We propose FLAG, a two-stage framework to help construct formal protocol specifications from informal documents. In the first stage, a predefined template set is used to generate candidate SVA properties. To avoid missing necessary properties, we develop a grammar-based approach to generate comprehensive template sets that capture critical signal behaviors for various communication protocols. In the second stage, we utilize unambiguous timing diagrams in conjunction with textual descriptions from the specification documents to filter out incorrect properties. A formal approach is first implemented to check the candidate properties and filter out those inconsistent with the timing diagrams. An LLM is then consulted to further remove incorrect properties with respect to the textual description, obtaining the final property set. Experiments on various open-source communication protocols demonstrate the effectiveness of FLAG in generating SVA properties from informal documents.",

    "summary": "The code review comment (CRC) is pivotal in the process of modern code review. It provides reviewers with the opportunity to identify potential bugs, offer constructive feedback, and suggest improvements. Clear and concise code review comments (CRCs) facilitate the communication between developers and are crucial to the correct understanding of the identified issues and proposed solutions. Despite the importance of CRCs' clarity, there is still a lack of guidelines on what constitutes a good clarity and how to evaluate it. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on understanding and evaluating the clarity of CRCs. We first derive a set of attributes related to the clarity of CRCs, namely RIE attributes (i.e., Relevance, Informativeness, and Expression), as well as their corresponding evaluation criteria based on our literature review and survey with practitioners. We then investigate the clarity of CRCs in open-source projects written in nine programming languages and find that a large portion (i.e., 28.8%) of the CRCs lack the clarity in at least one of the attributes. Finally, we explore the potential of automatically evaluating the clarity of CRCs by proposing ClearCRC. Experimental results show that ClearCRC with pre-trained language models is promising for effective evaluation of the clarity of CRCs, achieving a balanced accuracy up to 73.04% and a F-1 score up to 94.61%.",

    "summary": "Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another. Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc. We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans breaks down these projects into 17874 fragments and translates the entire repository. 96.40% of the translated fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 27.03% and 25.14% of fragments. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 34 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.",

    "summary": "The extensive application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative coding tasks has raised concerns due to their high computational demands and energy consumption. Unlike previous structural pruning methods designed for classification models that deal with lowdimensional classification logits, generative Code LLMs produce high-dimensional token logit sequences, making traditional pruning objectives inherently limited. Moreover, existing single component pruning approaches further constrain the effectiveness when applied to generative Code LLMs. In response, we propose Flab-Pruner, an innovative unified structural pruning method that combines vocabulary, layer, and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) pruning. This approach effectively reduces model parameters while maintaining performance. Additionally, we introduce a customized code instruction data strategy for coding tasks to enhance the performance recovery efficiency of the pruned model. Through extensive evaluations on three state-of-the-art Code LLMs across multiple generative coding tasks, the results demonstrate that Flab-Pruner retains 97% of the original performance after pruning 22% of the parameters and achieves the same or even better performance after post-training. The pruned models exhibit significant improvements in storage, GPU usage, computational efficiency, and environmental impact, while maintaining well robustness. Our research provides a sustainable solution for green software engineering and promotes the efficient deployment of LLMs in real-world generative coding intelligence applications.",

Thus, they suffer from suboptimal performance and lack of robustness and generalization. We introduce EditLord, a code editing framework that makes the code transformation steps explicit. Our key insight is to employ a language model (LM) as an inductive learner to extract code editing rules from the training code pairs as concise meta-rule sets. Such rule sets will be manifested for each training sample to augment them for finetuning or assist in prompting- and iterative-based code editing. EditLordoutperforms the state-of-the-art by an average of 22.7% in editing performance and 58.1% in robustness while achieving 20.2% higher functional correctness across critical software engineering and security applications, LM models, and editing modes.",

Real-world software vulnerability datasets are rare and hard to acquire, as there is no simple metric for classifying vulnerability. Such datasets are heavily imbalanced, and none of the current datasets are considered huge for DL models. To tackle these problems, a recent work has tried to augment the dataset using the source code and generate realistic single-statement vulnerabilities, which is not quite practical and requires manual checking of the generated vulnerabilities. In this paper, we aim to explore the augmentation of vulnerabilities at the representation level to help current models learn better, which has never been done before to the best of our knowledge. We implement and evaluate five augmentation techniques that augment the embedding of the data and have recently been used for code search, which is a completely different software engineering task. We also introduced a conditioned version of those augmentation methods, which ensures the augmentation does not change the vulnerable section of the vector representation. We show that such augmentation methods can be helpful and increase the F1-score by up to 9.67%, yet they cannot beat Random Oversampling when balancing datasets, which increases the F1-score by 10.82%.",

We consider the so-called active attacks to the privacy of social networks and the counterpart $(k,\\ell)$-anonymity measure, which is used to quantify the privacy satisfied by a social network against active attacks. To this end, we make use of the graph theoretical concept of $k$-metric antidimensional graphs for which the case $k=1$ represents those graphs achieving the worst scenario in privacy whilst considering the $(k,\\ell)$-anonymity measure.\nAs a product of our investigation, we present a large number of computational results stating that social networks might not be as insecure as one often thinks. In particular, we develop a large number of experiments on random graphs which show that the number of $1$-metric antidimensional graphs is indeed ridiculously small with respect to the total number of graphs that can be considered. Moreover, we search on several real networks in order to check if they are $1$-metric antidimensional, and obtain that none of them are such. Along the way, we show some theoretical studies on the mathematical properties of the $k$-metric antidimensional graphs for any suitable $k\\ge 1$. In addition, we also describe some operations on graphs that are $1$-metric antidimensional so that they get embedded into another larger graphs that are not such, in order to obscure their privacy properties against active attacks.",

    "summary": "Generative agents offer promising capabilities for simulating realistic urban behaviors. However, existing methods oversimplify transportation choices in modern cities, and require prohibitive computational resources for large-scale population simulation. To address these limitations, we first present a virtual city that features multiple functional buildings and transportation modes. Then, we conduct extensive surveys to model behavioral choices and mobility preferences among population groups. Building on these insights, we introduce a simulation framework that captures the complexity of urban mobility while remaining scalable, enabling the simulation of over 4,000 agents. To assess the realism of the generated behaviors, we perform a series of micro and macro-level analyses. Beyond mere performance comparison, we explore insightful experiments, such as predicting crowd density from movement patterns and identifying trends in vehicle preferences across agent demographics.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces SCRAG, a prediction framework inspired by social computing, designed to forecast community responses to real or hypothetical social media posts. SCRAG can be used by public relations specialists (e.g., to craft messaging in ways that avoid unintended misinterpretations) or public figures and influencers (e.g., to anticipate social responses), among other applications related to public sentiment prediction, crisis management, and social what-if analysis. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in generating coherent and contextually rich text, their reliance on static training data and susceptibility to hallucinations limit their effectiveness at response forecasting in dynamic social media environments. SCRAG overcomes these challenges by integrating LLMs with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique rooted in social computing. Specifically, our framework retrieves (i) historical responses from the target community to capture their ideological, semantic, and emotional makeup, and (ii) external knowledge from sources such as news articles to inject time-sensitive context. This information is then jointly used to forecast the responses of the target community to new posts or narratives. Extensive experiments across six scenarios on the X platform (formerly Twitter), tested with various embedding models and LLMs, demonstrate over 10% improvements on average in key evaluation metrics. A concrete example further shows its effectiveness in capturing diverse ideologies and nuances. Our work provides a social computing tool for applications where accurate and concrete insights into community responses are crucial.",

    "summary": "Network sampling is a crucial technique for analyzing large or partially observable networks. However, the effectiveness of different sampling methods can vary significantly depending on the context. In this study, we empirically compare representative methods from three main categories: node-based, edge-based, and exploration-based sampling. We used two real-world datasets for our analysis: a scientific collaboration network and a temporal message-sending network. Our results indicate that no single sampling method consistently outperforms the others in both datasets. Although advanced methods tend to provide better accuracy on static networks, they often perform poorly on temporal networks, where simpler techniques can be more effective. These findings suggest that the best sampling strategy depends not only on the structural characteristics of the network but also on the specific metrics that need to be preserved or analyzed. Our work offers practical insights for researchers in choosing sampling approaches that are tailored to different types of networks and analytical objectives.",

    "summary": "Long range flight by fixed-wing aircraft without propulsion systems can be accomplished by \"soaring\" -- exploiting randomly located updrafts to gain altitude which is expended in gliding flight. As the location of updrafts is uncertain and cannot be determined except through in situ observation, aircraft exploiting this energy source are at risk of failing to find a subsequent updraft. Determining when an updraft must be exploited to continue flight is essential to managing risk and optimizing speed. Graph percolation offers a theoretical explanation for this risk, and a framework for evaluating it using information available to the operator of a soaring aircraft in flight. The utility of graph percolation as a risk measure is examined by analyzing flight logs from human soaring pilots. This analysis indicates that in sport soaring pilots rarely operate in a condition which does not satisfy graph percolation, identifies an apparent desired minimum node degree, and shows that pilots accept reduced climb rates in order to maintain percolation.",

    "summary": "The premise of network statistics derived from Google Trends data to foresee COVID-19 disease progression is gaining momentum in infodemiology. This approach was applied in Metro Manila, National Capital Region, Philippines. Through dynamic time warping (DTW), the temporal alignment was quantified between network metrics and COVID-19 case trajectories, and systematically explored 320 parameter configurations including two network metrics (network density and clustering coefficient), two data preprocessing methods (Rescaling Daily Data and MSV), multiple thresholds, two correlation window sizes, and Sakoe-Chiba band constraints. Results from the Kruskal-Wallis tests revealed that five of the six parameters significantly influenced alignment quality, with the disease comparison type (active cases vs. confirmed cases) demonstrating the strongest effect. The optimal configuration, which is using the network density statistic with a Rescaling Daily Data transformation, a threshold of 0.8, a 15-day window, and a 50-day radius constraint, achieved a DTW score of 36.30. This indicated substantial temporal alignment with the COVID-19 confirmed cases data. The discoveries demonstrate that network metrics rooted from online search behavior can serve as complementary indicators for epidemic surveillance in urban locations like Metro Manila. This strategy leverages the Philippines' extensive online usage during the pandemic to provide potentially valuable early signals of disease spread, and offers a supplementary tool for public health monitoring in resource-limited situations.",

To this aim, we introduce a data-informed framework reconstructing online dynamics from 303k users interacting over two years.

Our analysis unveils online posting effects: a user can transition to another psychological state after online exposure to peers' emotional/semantic content. As described by conditional Markov chains and different levels of social exposure, users' transitions reveal navigation through both positive and negative phases in a spiral rather than a linear progression.

This study presents a post-hoc analysis of microtargeting practices within climate campaigns by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to examine Facebook advertisements. Our analysis focuses on two key aspects: demographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age group, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.55%. Furthermore, we instruct the LLMs to generate explanations for their classifications, providing transparent reasoning behind each decision. These explanations reveal the specific thematic elements used to engage different demographic segments, highlighting distinct strategies tailored to various audiences. Our findings show that young adults are primarily targeted through messages emphasizing activism and environmental consciousness, while women are engaged through themes related to caregiving roles and social advocacy. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting microtargeted messaging, we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis to identify potential biases in model predictions. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist, particularly in the classification of senior citizens and male audiences. By showcasing the efficacy of LLMs in dissecting and explaining targeted communication strategies and by highlighting fairness concerns, this study provides a valuable framework for future research aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in social media-driven climate campaigns.",

To quantify stealthiness, we employ the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, a measure rooted in hypothesis testing and detection theory, which captures the trade-off between an attacker's desire to remain stealthy and her goal of degrading system performance. First, we synthesize the worst-case stealthy attack in nonlinear CPS using the path integral approach. Second, we consider how a controller can mitigate the impact of such stealthy attacks by formulating a minimax KL control problem, yielding a zero-sum game between the attacker and the controller. Again, we leverage a path integral-based solution that computes saddle-point policies for both players through Monte Carlo simulations. We validate our approach using unicycle navigation and cruise control problems, demonstrating how an attacker can covertly drive the system into unsafe regions, and how the controller can adapt her policy to combat the worst-case attacks.",

While solutions to such linear differential games are typically obtained through coupled Riccati equations, the complexity increases when agents have incomplete information, particularly when neither is aware of the other's cost function. To tackle this challenge, we propose a model-based Peer-Aware Cost Estimation (PACE) framework for learning the cost parameters of the other agent. In PACE, each agent treats its peer as a learning agent rather than a stationary optimal agent, models their learning dynamics, and leverages this dynamic to infer the cost function parameters of the other agent. This approach enables agents to infer each other's objective function in real time based solely on their previous state observations and dynamically adapt their control policies. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee for the convergence of parameter estimation and the stability of system states in PACE. Additionally, in our numerical studies, we demonstrate how modeling the learning dynamics of the other agent benefits PACE, compared to approaches that approximate the other agent as having complete information, particularly in terms of stability and convergence speed.",

However, solving for equilibrium policies for such games presents a major challenge, especially if the games involve nonlinear underlying dynamics. To simplify the problem, existing work often assumes that one agent is an expert with complete information about its peer, which can lead to biased estimates and failures in coordination. To address this challenge, we propose a nonlinear peer-aware cost estimation (N-PACE) algorithm for general-sum dynamic games. In N-PACE, using iterative linear quadratic (LQ) approximation of the nonlinear general-sum game, each agent explicitly models the learning dynamics of its peer agent while inferring their objective functions, leading to unbiased fast learning in inferring the unknown objective function of the peer agent, which is critical for task completion and safety assurance.

Eliminating the reliance on nominal controllers or large datasets, our framework solves the optimal control problem directly using Neural ODEs. Stability and convergence are ensured through Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) in the loss function, while Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) embedded in the QP layer enforce real-time safety. By integrating the differentiable QP layer with Neural ODEs, we demonstrate compatibility with the adjoint method for gradient computation, enabling the learning of the CBF class-$\\mathcal{K}$ function and control network parameters. Experiments validate its effectiveness in balancing safety and performance.",

    "summary": "As water distribution networks (WDNs) become increasingly connected with digital infrastructures, they face greater exposure to cyberattacks that threaten their operational integrity. Stealthy False Data Injection Attacks (SFDIAs) are particularly concerning, as they manipulate sensor data to compromise system operations while avoiding detection. While existing studies have focused on either detection methods or specific attack formulations, the relationship between attack sophistication, system knowledge requirements, and achievable impact remains unexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis of sensor attacks against WDNs, investigating different combinations of physical constraints, state monitoring requirements, and intrusion detection evasion conditions. We propose several attack formulations that range from tailored strategies satisfying both physical and detection constraints to simpler measurement manipulations. The proposed attacks are simple and local -- requiring knowledge only of targeted sensors and their hydraulic connections -- making them scalable and practical. Through case studies on Net1 and Net3 benchmark networks, we demonstrate how these attacks can persistently increase operational costs and alter water flows while remaining undetected by monitoring systems for extended periods. The analysis provides utilities with insights for vulnerability assessment and motivates the development of protection strategies that combine physical and statistical security mechanisms.",

Typically, these controllers generate high-level commands like longitudinal acceleration or force. However, vehicles with combustion engines expect different actuation inputs. This paper proposes a longitudinal control concept that translates high-level trajectory-tracking commands to the required low-level vehicle commands such as throttle, brake pressure and a desired gear. We chose a modular structure to easily integrate different trajectory-tracking control algorithms and vehicles. The proposed control concept enables a close tracking of the high-level control command. An anti-lock braking system, traction control, and brake warmup control also ensure a safe operation during real-world tests. We provide experimental validation of our concept using real world data with longitudinal accelerations reaching up to $25 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{m}}{\\mathrm{s}^2}$.

Despite these needs, access to the internal firmware of power electronic devices remains restricted due to stringent nondisclosure agreements enforced by manufacturers. To address this, we explore three system identification techniques: sweep frequency response analysis (SFRA), step excitation method (SEM), and eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA). SFRA employs sinusoidal signals of varying frequencies to measure the system's frequency response, while SEM and ERA utilize step functions to derive time-domain responses and transform them into Laplace-domain transfer functions. All three approaches are shown to provide consistent results in identifying the dq admittance of grid-forming inverters (GFM) over a frequency range of 1 Hz to 100 Hz.",

    "summary": "Precise assembly of composite fuselages is critical for aircraft assembly to meet the ultra-high precision requirements. Due to dimensional variations, there is a gap when two fuselage assemble. In practice, actuators are required to adjust fuselage dimensions by applying forces to specific points on fuselage edge through pulling or pushing force actions. The positioning and force settings of these actuators significantly influence the efficiency of the shape adjustments. The current literature usually predetermines the fixed number of actuators, which is not optimal in terms of overall quality and corresponding actuator costs. However, optimal placement of actuators in terms of both locations and number is challenging due to compliant structures, complex material properties, and dimensional variabilities of incoming fuselages. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables sequential decision-making for actuator placement selection and optimal force computation. Specifically, our methodology employs the Dueling Double Deep Q-Learning (D3QN) algorithm to refine the decision-making capabilities of sequential actuator placements. The environment is meticulously crafted to enable sequential and incremental selection of an actuator based on system states. We formulate the actuator selection problem as a submodular function optimization problem, where the sub-modularity properties can be adopted to efficiently achieve near-optimal solutions. The proposed methodology has been comprehensively evaluated through numerical studies and comparison studies, demonstrating its effectiveness and outstanding performance in enhancing assembly precision with limited actuator numbers.",

To quantify this emissions impact, prior work typically employs short-run marginal emissions or average emissions rates calculated from historical data or power systems models that do not consider changes in installed capacity. In this work, we use an electricity system capacity expansion model to consider the full consequential GHG emissions impact from large-scale EV adoption in the western United States, accounting for induced changes in generation and storage capacity. We find that the metrics described above do not accurately reflect the true emissions impact of EV adoption-average emissions rates can either under- or over-estimate emission impacts, and short-run marginal emissions rates can significantly underestimate emission reductions, especially when charging timing is flexible. Our results also show that using short-run marginal emission rates as signals to coordinate EV charging could increase emissions relative to price-based charging signals, indicating the need for alternative control strategies to minimize consequential emissions.",

Many cable-driven exosuits have been developed but little has been published on their electromechanical designs and performance. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive design and performance analysis of a two degree of freedom tendon driver unit (TDU) for cable-driven wearable exosuits. Detailed methodologies are presented to benchmark the functionality of the TDU. A static torque output test compares the commanded and measured torques. A velocity control test evaluates the attenuation and phase shift across velocities. A noise test evaluates how loud the TDU is for the wearer under different speeds. A thermal stress test captures the cooling performance of the TDU to ensure safe operation at higher loads. Finally, a battery endurance test evaluates the runtime of the TDU under various loading conditions to inform the usable time. To demonstrate these tests, a modular TDU system for cable-driven applications is introduced, which allows components such as motors, pulleys, and sensors to be adapted based on the requirements of the intended application. By sharing detailed methodologies and performance results, this study aims to provide a TDU design that may be leveraged by others and resources for researchers and engineers to better document the capabilities of their TDU designs.",

Building upon the unified force-impedance control (UFIC) and our previous work on geometric impedance control (GIC), we develop the geometric unified force impedance control (GUFIC) to account for the SE(3) manifold structure in the controller formulation using a differential geometric perspective. As in the case of the UFIC, the GUFIC utilizes energy tank augmentation for both force-tracking and impedance control to guarantee the manipulator's passivity relative to external forces. This ensures that the end effector maintains safe contact interaction with uncertain environments and tracks a desired interaction force. Moreover, we resolve a non-causal implementation problem in the UFIC formulation by introducing velocity and force fields. Due to its formulation on SE(3), the proposed GUFIC inherits the desirable SE(3) invariance and equivariance properties of the GIC, which helps increase sample efficiency in machine learning applications where a learning algorithm is incorporated into the control law. The proposed control law is validated in a simulation environment under scenarios requiring tracking an SE(3) trajectory, incorporating both position and orientation, while exerting a force on a surface.

Solving OCPs with singular arcs often requires tailored treatments, suitable for offline trajectory optimization. This approach can become increasingly impractical for online closed-loop implementations, especially for large-scale engineering problems. Recent development of Integrated Residual Methods (IRM) have indicated their suitability for handling singular arcs; the convergence of error measures in IRM automatically suppresses singular arc-induced fluctuations and leads to non-fluctuating solutions more suitable for practical problems. Through several examples, we demonstrate the advantages of solving OCPs with singular arcs using {IRM} under an economic model predictive control framework. In particular, the following observations are made: (i) IRM does not require special treatment for singular arcs, (ii) it solves the OCPs reliably with singular arc fluctuation suppressed, and (iii) the closed-loop results closely match the analytic optimal solutions.",

    "summary": "Contraction metrics are crucial in control theory because they provide a powerful framework for analyzing stability, robustness, and convergence of various dynamical systems. However, identifying these metrics for complex nonlinear systems remains an open challenge due to the lack of scalable and effective tools. This paper explores the approach of learning verifiable contraction metrics parametrized as neural networks (NNs) for discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems. While prior works on formal verification of contraction metrics for general nonlinear systems have focused on convex optimization methods (e.g. linear matrix inequalities, etc) under the assumption of continuously differentiable dynamics, the growing prevalence of NN-based controllers, often utilizing ReLU activations, introduces challenges due to the non-smooth nature of the resulting closed-loop dynamics. To bridge this gap, we establish a new sufficient condition for establishing formal neural contraction metrics for general discrete-time nonlinear systems assuming only the continuity of the dynamics. We show that from a computational perspective, our sufficient condition can be efficiently verified using the state-of-the-art neural network verifier $\\alpha,\\!\\beta$-CROWN, which scales up non-convex neural network verification via novel integration of symbolic linear bound propagation and branch-and-bound. Built upon our analysis tool, we further develop a learning method for synthesizing neural contraction metrics from sampled data. Finally, our approach is validated through the successful synthesis and verification of NN contraction metrics for various nonlinear examples.",

Here we demonstrate a knowledge-injected Bayesian optimization approach for adaptive XANES data collection that incorporates understanding of spectral features like absorption edges and pre-edge peaks. We show this method accurately reconstructs the absorption edge of XANES spectra using only 15-20% of the measurement points typically needed for conventional sampling, while maintaining the ability to determine the x-ray energy of the sharp peak after absorption edge with errors less than 0.03 eV, the absorption edge with errors less than 0.1 eV; and overall root-mean-square errors less than 0.005 compared to compared to traditionally sampled spectra. Our experiments on battery materials and catalysts demonstrate the method's effectiveness for both static and dynamic XANES measurements, improving data collection efficiency and enabling better time resolution for tracking chemical changes.

    "summary": "We consider dynamical models given by rational ODE systems. Parameter estimation is an important and challenging task of recovering parameter values from observed data. Recently, a method based on differential algebra and rational interpolation was proposed to express parameter estimation in terms of polynomial system solving. Typically, polynomial system solving is a bottleneck, hence the choice of the polynomial solver is crucial. In this contribution, we compare two polynomial system solvers applied to parameter estimation: homotopy continuation solver from this http URL and our new implementation of a certified solver based on rational univariate representation (RUR) and real root isolation. We show how the new RUR solver can tackle examples that are out of reach for the homotopy methods and vice versa.",

After establishing a correspondence between state controllability in networks of first-order systems with output controllability in networks of higher-order systems, we show that adding higher-order dynamics may require significantly fewer subsystem modifications to achieve structural controllability, when compared to first-order heterogeneous subsystems. Furthermore, we characterize the topology of networks (which we call X-networks) in which the introduction of heterogeneous local dynamics is not necessary for structural output controllability, as the latter can be attained by suitable higher-order subsystems with homogeneous internal dynamics.",

    "summary": "Navigating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) through cluttered and dynamic environments remains a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with fast-moving or sudden-appearing obstacles. This paper introduces a complete LiDAR-based system designed to enable UAVs to avoid various moving obstacles in complex environments. Benefiting the high computational efficiency of perception and planning, the system can operate in real time using onboard computing resources with low latency. For dynamic environment perception, we have integrated our previous work, M-detector, into the system. M-detector ensures that moving objects of different sizes, colors, and types are reliably detected. For dynamic environment planning, we incorporate dynamic object predictions into the integrated planning and control (IPC) framework, namely DynIPC. This integration allows the UAV to utilize predictions about dynamic obstacles to effectively evade them. We validate our proposed system through both simulations and real-world experiments. In simulation tests, our system outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across several metrics, including success rate, time consumption, average flight time, and maximum velocity. In real-world trials, our system successfully navigates through forests, avoiding moving obstacles along its path.",

This paper bridges this gap by formally proving the equivalence between these two methodologies for sampled-data, first-order systems, considering both single and multiple constraint scenarios. By demonstrating this equivalence, we provide a unified perspective on these techniques. This unification has theoretical and practical implications, facilitating the cross-application of robustness guarantees and algorithmic improvements between complementarity and CBF frameworks.

    "summary": "Intelligent condition monitoring of wind turbines is essential for reducing downtimes. Machine learning models trained on wind turbine operation data are commonly used to detect anomalies and, eventually, operation faults. However, data-driven normal behavior models (NBMs) require a substantial amount of training data, as NBMs trained with scarce data may result in unreliable fault diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel generative deep learning approach to make SCADA samples from one wind turbine lacking training data resemble SCADA data from wind turbines with representative training data. Through CycleGAN-based domain mapping, our method enables the application of an NBM trained on an existing wind turbine to one with severely limited data. We demonstrate our approach on field data mapping SCADA samples across 7 substantially different WTs. Our findings show significantly improved fault diagnosis in wind turbines with scarce data. Our method achieves the most similar anomaly scores to an NBM trained with abundant data, outperforming NBMs trained on scarce training data with improvements of +10.3% in F1-score when 1 month of training data is available and +16.8% when 2 weeks are available. The domain mapping approach outperforms conventional fine-tuning at all considered degrees of data scarcity, ranging from 1 to 8 weeks of training data. The proposed technique enables earlier and more reliable fault diagnosis in newly installed wind farms, demonstrating a novel and promising research direction to improve anomaly detection when faced with training data scarcity.",

The contribution of the paper is rooted in a measured-state initialization strategy. First, due to the nonzero probability of violating chance-constraints in the case of unbounded noise, we introduce ellipsoidal-based probabilistic reachable sets and we include constraint relaxations to recover recursive feasibility conditioned to the measured state. Second, we prove that the solution of this novel SMPC scheme guarantees closed-loop chance constraints satisfaction under minimum relaxation. Last, we demonstrate that, in expectation, the need of relaxing the constraints vanishes over time, which leads the closed-loop trajectories steered towards the unconstrained LQR invariant region. This novel SMPC scheme is proven to satisfy the recursive feasibility conditioned to the state realization, and its superiority with respect to open-loop initialization schemes is shown through numerical examples.",

This paper (a) explores if and when a control designer has flexibility in this choice, (b) develops a canonical choice related to the Christoffel symbols, and (c) describes how to efficiently perform control computations with it for constrained mechanical systems. We link the choice of a Coriolis factorization to the notion of an affine connection on the configuration manifold and show how properties of the connection relate with the associated factorization. In particular, the factorization based on the Christoffel symbols is linked with a torsion-free property that can limit the twisting of system trajectories during passivity-based control. We then develop a way to induce Coriolis factorizations for constrained mechanisms from unconstrained ones, which provides a pathway to use the theory for efficient control computations with high-dimensional systems such as humanoids and quadruped robots with open- and closed-chain mechanisms. A collection of algorithms is provided (and made available open source) to support the recursive computation of passivity-based control laws, adaptation laws, and regressor matrices in future applications.",

    "summary": "Traffic pattern prediction has emerged as a promising approach for efficiently managing and mitigating the impacts of event-driven bursty traffic in massive machine-type communication (mMTC) networks. However, achieving accurate predictions of bursty traffic remains a non-trivial task due to the inherent randomness of events, and these challenges intensify within live network environments. Consequently, there is a compelling imperative to design a lightweight and agile framework capable of assimilating continuously collected data from the network and accurately forecasting bursty traffic in mMTC networks. This paper addresses these challenges by presenting a machine learning-based framework tailored for forecasting bursty traffic in multi-channel slotted ALOHA networks. The proposed machine learning network comprises long-term short-term memory (LSTM) and a DenseNet with feed-forward neural network (FFNN) layers, where the residual connections enhance the training ability of the machine learning network in capturing complicated patterns. Furthermore, we develop a new low-complexity online prediction algorithm that updates the states of the LSTM network by leveraging frequently collected data from the mMTC network. Simulation results and complexity analysis demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm in terms of both accuracy and complexity, making it well-suited for time-critical live scenarios. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework in a network with a single base station and thousands of devices organized into groups with distinct traffic-generating characteristics. Comprehensive evaluations and simulations indicate that our proposed machine learning approach achieves a remarkable $52\\%$ higher accuracy in long-term predictions compared to traditional methods, without imposing additional processing load on the system.",

For a uniformly jointly strongly connected time-varying directed graph, a distributed bandit online primal-dual projection algorithm with one-point sampling is proposed.

However, conventional deep learning and Transformer models often struggle to process data with inherent symmetries and invariances, typically relying on large datasets or extensive data augmentation. Equivariant neural networks overcome these limitations by explicitly integrating symmetry and invariance into their architectures, leading to improved efficiency and generalization. This tutorial survey reviews a wide range of equivariant deep learning and control methods for robotics, from classic to state-of-the-art, with a focus on SE(3)-equivariant models that leverage the natural 3D rotational and translational symmetries in visual robotic manipulation and control design. Using unified mathematical notation, we begin by reviewing key concepts from group theory, along with matrix Lie groups and Lie algebras. We then introduce foundational group-equivariant neural network design and show how the group-equivariance can be obtained through their structure. Next, we discuss the applications of SE(3)-equivariant neural networks in robotics in terms of imitation learning and reinforcement learning. The SE(3)-equivariant control design is also reviewed from the perspective of geometric control. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions of equivariant methods in developing more robust, sample-efficient, and multi-modal real-world robotic systems.",

However, its application to horizontal (XY) positioning is limited by significantly lower acoustic stiffness and insufficient damping in horizontal directions, resulting in reduced resolution and bandwidth. Moreover, NFAL-based positioning systems typically lack multi-axis actuation capabilities due to challenges in generating multi-directional acoustic forces. This work presents a hybrid positioning approach that overcomes the mentioned limitations by integrating NFAL with electromagnetic actuation. A planar magnetic platform is acoustically levitated, while a coplanar current-carrying coil provides horizontal trapping stiffness more than three orders of magnitude higher than that achievable with acoustic forces alone. Additionally, the coil generates three-dimensional electromagnetic forces, enabling multi-axis positioning capability. Eddy currents induced in a thin copper sheet integrated with the coil enhance horizontal damping by 52 times. We experimentally demonstrate precise 3-axis linear motion with a root mean square (RMS) positioning resolution better than 20 nm along all axes. The system achieves an in-plane motion range of 1.42 mm with a bandwidth of 16 Hz and a Z-axis motion range of 40 micrometers with a positioning bandwidth of 171 Hz.",

    "summary": "Data-driven model predictive control (MPC) has demonstrated significant potential for improving robot control performance in the presence of model uncertainties. However, existing approaches often require extensive offline data collection and computationally intensive training, limiting their ability to adapt online. To address these challenges, this paper presents a fast online adaptive MPC framework that leverages neural networks integrated with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Our approach focuses on few-shot adaptation of residual dynamics - capturing the discrepancy between nominal and true system behavior - using minimal online data and gradient steps. By embedding these meta-learned residual models into a computationally efficient L4CasADi-based MPC pipeline, the proposed method enables rapid model correction, enhances predictive accuracy, and improves real-time control performance. We validate the framework through simulation studies on a Van der Pol oscillator, a Cart-Pole system, and a 2D quadrotor. Results show significant gains in adaptation speed and prediction accuracy over both nominal MPC and nominal MPC augmented with a freshly initialized neural network, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach for real-time adaptive robot control.",

Such graphs that are not isomorphic are generalized cospectral mates. We derive tight upper bounds on the number of non-isomorphic generalized cospectral mates an oriented graph can admit, based on arithmetic criteria involving the determinant of its skew-walk matrix. As a special case, we also provide a criterion for an oriented graph to be weakly determined by its generalized skew spectrum (WDGSS), that is, its only generalized cospectral mate is its transpose. These criteria relate directly to the controllability of graphs, a fundamental concept in the control of networked systems, thereby connecting spectral characterization of graphs to graph controllability.",

It was expected, but not known, that $\\mathbb{E}_n$-Koszul duality should induce a kind of Morita equivalence between categories of iterated modules. We establish this rigorously by proving that the $(\\infty,n)$-category of iterated modules over $\\mathrm{C}_{\\bullet}(\\Omega_*^{n+1}X;\\Bbbk)$ is equivalent to the $(\\infty,n)$-category of quasi-coherent sheaves of $(\\infty,n-1)$-categories on $\\mathrm{cSpec}(\\mathrm{C}^{\\bullet}(X;\\Bbbk))$, where $\\mathrm{cSpec}(\\mathrm{C}^{\\bullet}(X;\\Bbbk))$ is the cospectrum of $\\mathrm{C}^{\\bullet}(X;\\Bbbk)$. By the monodromy equivalence, these categories are also equivalent to the category of higher local systems on $X$, $n\\mathbf{LocSysCat}^{n-1}(X;\\Bbbk)$. Our result is new already in the classical case $n=1$, although it can be seen to recover well known formulations of $\\mathbb{E}_1$-Koszul duality as a Morita equivalence of module categories (up to appropriate completions of the $t$-structures). We also investigate (higher) affineness properties of Betti stacks. We give a complete characterization of $n$-affine Betti stacks, in terms of the $0$-affineness of their iterated loop space.

In this program, he claims that smooth positive characteristic varieties should carry l-adic formal manifold structures. He also claims the existence of an abelianized Galois symmetry on l-adic formal manifold structures. This paper carries out this program, establishes the claims, and relates the abelianized Galois symmetry on l-adic formal manifold structures to the Galois symmetry of varieties. Meanwhile, we prove that simply-connected varieties are homotopically finite CW complexes in the l-adic sense.",

We want to look at the behaviour of this spectrum from a differential point of view. In such a spectrum, for example, there exist open subsets having functions with log-growth as sections for the structural sheaf. In this framework, a transfer theorem for the log-growth of solutions of p-adic differential equations can be interpreted as a continuity theorem (analogue to the transfer theorem for their radii of convergence in the Berkovich spaces). As a dividend of such a theory, we define a new cohomology theory in terms of the Hodge-completed derived de Rham cohomology of the ind-Banach derived analytic space associated to a smooth k-scheme, X_k (k residual field of V), via the use of \"tempered tubes\".\nWe finally compare our tempered de Rham cohomology with crystalline cohomology.",

Any such dual complex is a skeleton, i.e. a nonarchimedean analytic retract, and admits a combinatorial divisor theory via specialisation. These structures on the dual complex interact via a Poincaré-Lelong slope formula, which interprets specialisations of divisors as Laplacians of PL functions. The main result presented here shows that finite covers of toroidal schemes give harmonic morphisms of dual complexes, i.e. morphisms that preserve the tropical Laplace equation. A crucial ingredient is a balancing condition which is a variant of the tropical multiplicity formula for dual complexes. We apply these results to obtain a Riemann-Hurwitz formula for covers of skeleta in any dimension: the Laplacian of the different function is the tropical relative canonical divisor.",

Our approach introduces a novel synthesis of techniques from fractional partial differential equations and control theory, combining several key ingredients in an original and effective manner:\n1. Boundary observability for low-frequency solutions of the fractional wave equation. We begin by analyzing the associated fractional wave equation. Using a fractional analogue of Pohozaev's identity, we establish a partial boundary observability result for the low-frequency solutions. The corresponding observability time horizon increases with the eigenmode frequency, reflecting the inherently slower propagation speed of the fractional waves.\n2. Transmutation to the parabolic setting. Using transmutation techniques, we transfer the observability results from the wave setting to the parabolic one. This yields a frequency-dependent observability inequality for the fractional heat equation, which - via duality - enables control of its low-frequency components.\n3. Frequency-wise iteration. Leveraging the dissipative nature of the fractional heat equation, we develop an iterative procedure to successively control the entire frequency spectrum of solutions. The condition $s \\in (1/2, 1)$ is crucial in this analysis, as it guarantees sufficient decay of high-frequency components, enabling the convergence of the iteration.\n4. Duality. By a duality argument, we derive boundary observability from the boundary controllability of the fractional heat equation. Remarkably, this type of boundary observability result is entirely new in the multi-dimensional setting and appears to be out of reach for existing methods. \\end{itemize}",

Compared with the previous work, our asymptotic error accuracy has been improved from $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{\\log t}t)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. More importantly, by establishing two matrix valued functions, we obtained effective asymptotic errors and successfully constructed asymptotic analysis of the spin-1 GP equation based on the characteristics of the spectral problem, including two cases: (i)coexistence of discrete and continuous spectrum; (ii)only continuous spectrum which considered by Geng's work with error $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{\\log t}t)$. For the case (i), the corresponding asymptotic approximations can be characterized with an $N$-soliton as well as an interaction term between soliton solutions and the dispersion term with diverse residual error order $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. For the case (ii), the corresponding asymptotic approximations can be characterized with the leading term on the continuous spectrum and the residual error order $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$.

At its very core it is a simple conservation law, which serves as a toy model for various dynamics phenomena. In particular, it supports explicit heteroclinic solutions, both fronts and backs. Their stability has been studied in details. There has been substantial interest in considering dispersive and/or diffusive modifications, which present novel dynamical paradigms in such simple setting. More specificaly, the KdV-Burgers model has been showed to support unique fronts (not all of them monotone!) with fixed values at $\\pm \\infty$. Many articles, among which \\cite{Pego}, \\cite{NS1}, \\cite{NS2}, have studied the question of stability of monotone (or close to monotone) fronts.\nIn a breakthrough paper, \\cite{BBHY}, the authors have extended these results in several different directions. They have considered a wider range of models. The fronts do not need to be monotone, but are subject of a spectral condition instead. Most importantly the method allows for large perturbations, as long as the heteroclinic conditions at $\\pm \\infty$ are met. That is, there is asymptotic attraction to the said fronts or equivalently the limit set consist of one point.\nThe purpose of this paper is to extend the results of \\cite{BBHY} by providing explicit algebraic rates of convergence as $t\\to \\infty$. We bootstrap these results from the results in \\cite{BBHY} using additional energy estimates for two important examples namely KdV-Burgers and the fractional Burgers problem.

    "summary": "The elapsed-time model describes the behavior of interconnected neurons through the time since their last spike. It is an age-structured non-linear equation in which age corresponds to the elapsed time since the last discharge, and models many interesting dynamics depending on the type of interactions between neurons. We investigate the linearized stability of this equation by considering a discrete delay, which accounts for the possibility of a synaptic delay due to the time needed to transmit a nerve impulse from one neuron to the rest of the ensemble. We state a stability criterion that allows to determine if a steady state is linearly stable or unstable depending on the delay and the interaction between neurons. Our approach relies on the study of the asymptotic behavior of related Volterra-type integral equations in terms of theirs Laplace transforms. The analysis is complemented with numerical simulations illustrating the change of stability of a steady state in terms of the delay and the intensity of interconnections.",

This description includes both extended magnetic flux and spin-orbit/soft-disk interaction between the particles which are confined in a scalar trapping potential. We study a physically well-motivated ansatz for a sequence of trial states, consisting of Jastrow repulsive short-range correlations and a condensate, with sufficient variational freedom to approximate the ground state (and possibly also low-energy excited states) of the gas. In the limit $N \\to \\infty$, while taking the relative size of the anyons to zero and the total magnetic flux $2\\pi\\beta$ to remain finite, we rigorously derive the stationary Chern-Simons-Schrödinger/average-field-Pauli effective energy density functional for the condensate wave function. This includes a scalar self-interaction parameter $\\gamma$ which depends both on $\\beta$, the diluteness of the gas, and the spin-orbit coupling strength $g$, but becomes independent of these microscopic details for a particular value of the coupling $g=2$ in which supersymmetry is exhibited (on all scales, both microscopic and mesoscopic) with $\\gamma=2\\pi|\\beta|$.

This work formulates the Riemann-Hilbert problem associated with the SK and mSK equations by using direct and inverse scattering transforms. The long-time asymptotic behaviors of the solutions to these equations are then analyzed via the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method for Riemann-Hilbert problems. It is shown that the asymptotic solutions of the SK and mSK equations are categorized into four distinct regions: the decay region, the dispersive wave region, the Painlevé region, and the rapid decay region. Notably, the Painlevé region is governed by the F-XVIII equation in the Painlevé classification of fourth-order ordinary differential equations, a fourth-order analogue of the Painlevé transcendents. This connection is established through the Riemann-Hilbert formulation in this work. Similar to the KdV equation, the SK equation exhibits a transition region between the dispersive wave and Painlevé regions, arising from the special values of the reflection coefficients at the origin. Finally, numerical comparisons demonstrate that the asymptotic solutions agree excellently with results from direct numerical simulations.",

This parameter can be thought of as a matrix-valued path, and the usual free energy is recovered by setting this parameter to be the constant path taking only the value $0$. Furthermore, the enriched free energy can be expressed using a variational formula, which is a natural extension of the Parisi formula for the usual free energy. For models with scalar spins the Parisi formula can be expressed as an optimization problem over a convex set, and it was shown in [arXiv:1402.5132] that this problem has a unique optimizer thanks to a strict convexity property. For models with vector spins, the Parisi formula cannot easily be written as a convex optimization problem. In this paper, we generalize the uniqueness of Parisi measures proven in [arXiv:1402.5132] to the enriched free energy of models with vector spins when the extra parameter is a strictly increasing path. Our approach relies on a Gateaux differentiability property of the free energy and the envelope theorem.",

It was expected, but not known, that $\\mathbb{E}_n$-Koszul duality should induce a kind of Morita equivalence between categories of iterated modules. We establish this rigorously by proving that the $(\\infty,n)$-category of iterated modules over $\\mathrm{C}_{\\bullet}(\\Omega_*^{n+1}X;\\Bbbk)$ is equivalent to the $(\\infty,n)$-category of quasi-coherent sheaves of $(\\infty,n-1)$-categories on $\\mathrm{cSpec}(\\mathrm{C}^{\\bullet}(X;\\Bbbk))$, where $\\mathrm{cSpec}(\\mathrm{C}^{\\bullet}(X;\\Bbbk))$ is the cospectrum of $\\mathrm{C}^{\\bullet}(X;\\Bbbk)$. By the monodromy equivalence, these categories are also equivalent to the category of higher local systems on $X$, $n\\mathbf{LocSysCat}^{n-1}(X;\\Bbbk)$. Our result is new already in the classical case $n=1$, although it can be seen to recover well known formulations of $\\mathbb{E}_1$-Koszul duality as a Morita equivalence of module categories (up to appropriate completions of the $t$-structures). We also investigate (higher) affineness properties of Betti stacks. We give a complete characterization of $n$-affine Betti stacks, in terms of the $0$-affineness of their iterated loop space. As a consequence, we prove that $n$-truncated Betti stacks are $n$-affine; and that $\\pi_{n+1}(X)$ is an obstruction to $n$-affineness.",

In this work, we study combinatorial bifurcations within the framework of combinatorial multivector field theory--a young but already well-established theory providing a combinatorial model for continuous-time dynamical systems (or simply, flows). We introduce Conley-Morse persistence barcode, a compact algebraic descriptor of combinatorial bifurcations. The barcode captures structural changes in a dynamical system at the level of Morse decompositions and provides a characterization of the nature of observed transitions in terms of the Conley index. The construction of Conley-Morse persistence barcode builds upon ideas from topological data analysis (TDA). Specifically, we consider a persistence module obtained from a zigzag filtration of topological pairs (formed by index pairs defining the Conley index) over a poset. Using gentle algebras, we prove that this module decomposes into simple intervals (bars) and compute them with algorithms from TDA known for processing zigzag filtrations.",

The second section presents a detailed research prospectus that outlines a roadmap for developing sheaf-theoretic approaches to model and analyze complex systems of interacting agents. We propose that sheaf theory's inherent local-to-global perspective may provide valuable mathematical tools for reasoning about how local agent behaviors collectively determine emergent system properties. The third section contains a literature review connecting sheaf theory with existing research in multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and economic modeling. This paper does not present a completed model but rather lays theoretical groundwork and identifies promising research directions that could bridge abstract mathematics with practical AI applications, potentially revealing new approaches to coordination and emergence in multi-agent systems.",

A natural problem then is to analyse and compare the (not necessarily hierarchical) sequences of partitions that underpin such multiscale descriptions. Here, we use tools from topological data analysis and introduce the Multiscale Clustering Filtration (MCF), a well-defined and stable filtration of abstract simplicial complexes that encodes arbitrary cluster assignments in a sequence of partitions across scales of increasing coarseness. We show that the zero-dimensional persistent homology of the MCF measures the degree of hierarchy of this sequence, and the higher-dimensional persistent homology tracks the emergence and resolution of conflicts between cluster assignments across the sequence of partitions. To broaden the theoretical foundations of the MCF, we provide an equivalent construction via a nerve complex filtration, and we show that, in the hierarchical case, the MCF reduces to a Vietoris-Rips filtration of an ultrametric space. Using synthetic data, we then illustrate how the persistence diagram of the MCF provides a feature map that can serve to characterise and classify multiscale clusterings.",

This also leads to new, beneficial perspectives to the associated computational challenges. Most importantly, we present a high-speed, publicly available, low-level implementation that provides speed-ups of several orders of magnitude on C. Elegans. Furthermore, the speed gains grow with the size of the considered graph. This is made possible due to the mathematical and algorithmic improvements as well as a carefully crafted implementation. These speed-ups enable, for the first time, the analysis of full-sized connectomes such as those obtained by recent reconstructive methods. Additionally, the speed-ups allow comparative analysis to corresponding null models, appropriately designed randomly structured artificial graphs that do not correspond to actual brains.

It involves an interesting function, which we denote as $\\mathcal{F}_1(x)$. In this paper, we show that $\\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ belongs to the category of period functions as it satisfies the period relations of Maass forms in the sense of Lewis and Zagier \\cite{lz}. Hence, we refer to $\\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ as the \\emph{Ramanujan period function}. Moreover, one of the salient aspects of the Ramanujan period function $\\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ that we found out is that it is a Hecke eigenfunction under the action of Hecke operators on the space of periods. We also establish that it naturally appears in a Kronecker limit formula of a certain zeta function, revealing its connections to various topics. Finally, we generalize $\\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ to include a parameter $s,$ connecting our work to the broader theory of period functions developed by Bettin and Conrey \\cite{bc} and Lewis and Zagier \\cite{lz}. We emphasize that Ramanujan was the first to study this function, marking the beginning of the study of period functions.",

This is the \\emph{infinite spin problem} which concerns the rotational behavior of total collision orbits in the $n$-body problem. The question also makes sense for partial collision.\nWe show that the infinite spin is not possible if the limiting circle is isolated from other connected components of the set of normalized central configurations. Our approach extends the method from recent work for total collision by Moeckel and Montgomery, which was based on a combination of the center manifold theorem with Łojasiewicz inequality. To that we add a shadowing result for pseudo-orbits near normally hyperbolic manifold and careful estimates on the influence of other bodies on the cluster of colliding bodies.",

We establish the key properties of Forman curvature in the context of multilayer networks and demonstrate its utility for identifying vertices that hold central positions within these networks.

    "summary": "The notion of graph cover, also known as locally bijective homomorphism, is a discretization of covering spaces known from general topology. It is a pair of incidence-preserving vertex- and edge-mappings between two graphs, the edge-component being bijective on the edge-neighborhoods of every vertex and its image. In line with the current trends in topological graph theory and its applications in mathematical physics, graphs are considered in the most relaxed form and as such they may contain multiple edges, loops and semi-edges.\nNevertheless, simple graphs (binary structures without multiple edges, loops, or semi-edges) play an important role. It has been conjectured in [Bok et al.: List covering of regular multigraphs, Proceedings IWOCA 2022, LNCS 13270, pp. 228--242] that for every fixed graph $H$, deciding if a graph covers $H$ is either polynomial time solvable for arbitrary input graphs, or NP-complete for simple ones. A graph $A$ is called stronger than a graph $B$ if every simple graph that covers $A$ also covers $B$. This notion was defined and found useful for NP-hardness reductions for disconnected graphs in [Bok et al.: Computational complexity of covering disconnected multigraphs, Proceedings FCT 2022, LNCS 12867, pp. 85--99]. It was conjectured in [Kratochv\\'ıl: Towards strong dichotomy of graphs covers, GROW 2022 - Book of open problems, p. 10, {\\tt this https URL}] that if $A$ has no semi-edges, then $A$ is stronger than $B$ if and only if $A$ covers $B$. We prove this conjecture for cubic one-vertex graphs, and we also justify it for all cubic graphs $A$ with at most 4 vertices.",

We consider the so-called active attacks to the privacy of social networks and the counterpart $(k,\\ell)$-anonymity measure, which is used to quantify the privacy satisfied by a social network against active attacks. To this end, we make use of the graph theoretical concept of $k$-metric antidimensional graphs for which the case $k=1$ represents those graphs achieving the worst scenario in privacy whilst considering the $(k,\\ell)$-anonymity measure.\nAs a product of our investigation, we present a large number of computational results stating that social networks might not be as insecure as one often thinks. In particular, we develop a large number of experiments on random graphs which show that the number of $1$-metric antidimensional graphs is indeed ridiculously small with respect to the total number of graphs that can be considered. Moreover, we search on several real networks in order to check if they are $1$-metric antidimensional, and obtain that none of them are such. Along the way, we show some theoretical studies on the mathematical properties of the $k$-metric antidimensional graphs for any suitable $k\\ge 1$. In addition, we also describe some operations on graphs that are $1$-metric antidimensional so that they get embedded into another larger graphs that are not such, in order to obscure their privacy properties against active attacks.",

We aim to prove a similar statement where the notion of close is whether the given (signed) subgraph count can be used as a test between $\\mathbb{G}(n,1/2)$ and a stochastic block model $\\mathbb{SBM}.$\nQuantitatively, this is related to approximately maximizing $H \\longrightarrow |\\Phi(H)|^{\\frac{1}{|\\mathsf{V}(H)|}},$ where $\\Phi(H)$ is the Fourier coefficient of $\\mathbb{SBM}$, indexed by subgraph $H.$ This formulation turns out to be equivalent to approximately maximizing the partition function of a spin model over alphabet equal to the community labels in $\\mathbb{SBM}.$\nWe resolve the approximate maximization when $\\mathbb{SBM}$ satisfies one of four conditions: 1) the probability of an edge between any two vertices in different communities is exactly $1/2$; 2) the probability of an edge between two vertices from any two communities is at least $1/2$ (this case is also covered in a recent work of Yu, Zadik, and Zhang); 3) the probability of belonging to any given community is at least $c$ for some universal constant $c>0$; 4) $\\mathbb{SBM}$ has two communities.

It measures the system's ability to serve multiple users concurrently. Mathematically, the SRR is a polytope in R^k where each dimension corresponds to the service request rate of one of the k data objects. This paper focuses on systems employing a class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes. For each code in the class, we characterize the k axes intercept points of its SRR, and the smallest standard simplex that includes the SRR. We use these results to show that the SRR grows with the increasing number of systematic columns in the generator matrices. We establish a graph-theoretic framework associating this SRR problem with fractional matchings in quasi-uniform hypergraphs. Identifying the SRR polytope is equivalent to determining a particular image of the fractional-matching polytope. We introduce a notion of Greedy Matching and show that it is sufficient to focus on these matchings to characterize the SRR rather than the entire matching polytope. With these tools, we determine the SRR of a large subset of the considered class of codes. Our results generalize previous characterizations of systematic and non-systematic MDS-coded systems, offering a unified framework for analyzing service rate regions of codes.",

We investigate the gap within these pairs of parameters for hypergraphs that are the intersection of a given number k of matroids. We prove that in such hypergraphs the list chromatic number is at most k times the chromatic number and at most 2k-1 times the maximum chromatic number among the k matroids. We study the relationship between three polytopes associated with k-sets of matroids, and connect them to bounds on the fractional chromatic number of the intersection of the members of the k-set. This also connects to bounds on the matroidal matching and covering number of the intersection of the members of the k-set. The tools used are in part topological.",

Let $f(z_1,\\ldots,z_n)\\in\\mathbb{Z}[z_1,\\ldots,z_n]$ be a symmetric polynomial with integer coefficients and let $\\omega$ be a primitive $d$th root of unity. If $d|n$ or $d|(n-1)$ then we have $f(1,\\ldots,\\omega^{n-1})\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. If $d|n$ then of course we have $f(\\omega,\\ldots,\\omega^n)=f(1,\\ldots,\\omega^{n-1})\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, but when $d|(n+1)$ we also have $f(\\omega,\\ldots,\\omega^n)\\in\\mathbb{Z}$.

A tree like that is called a host tree. Several characterizations and properties of hypertrees have been discovered over the years. However, the interest in the structure of their host trees was weaker and restricted to particular scenarios where they arise, like the clique tree of chordal graphs. In that special case, the proofs of most characteristics of clique trees that exist in the literature rely significantly on the structural properties of chordal graphs. The purpose of this work is the study of the properties of the host trees of hypertrees in a more general context and have them described in a single place, giving simpler proofs for known facts, generalizing others and introducing some new concepts that the author considers that are relevant for the study of the topic. Particularly, we will determine what edges can be found in some host tree of a hypertree, and how these edges must be combined to form a host tree, with an emphasis in tools like the basis and the completion of a hypergraph, and the concept of equivalent hypergraphs.",

Building on prior works, it was recently shown that expander random walks can fool all symmetric functions in total variation distance (TVD) upto an $O(\\lambda(\\frac{p}{\\min f})^{O(p)})$ error, where $\\lambda$ is the second largest eigenvalue of the expander, $p$ is the size of the arbitrary alphabet used to label the vertices, and $\\min f = \\min_{b\\in[p]} f_b$, where $f_b$ is the fraction of vertices labeled $b$ in the graph. Golowich and Vadhan conjecture that the dependency on the $(\\frac{p}{\\min f})^{O(p)}$ term is not tight. In this paper, we resolve the conjecture in the affirmative for a family of expanders. We present a generalization of the sticky random walk for which Golowich and Vadhan predict a TVD upper bound of $O(\\lambda p^{O(p)})$ using a Fourier-analytic approach. For this family of graphs, we use a combinatorial approach involving the Krawtchouk functions to derive a strengthened TVD of $O(\\lambda)$. Furthermore, we present equivalencies between the generalized sticky random walk, and, using linear-algebraic techniques, show that the generalized sticky random walk parameterizes an infinite family of expander graphs.",

This is reminiscent of the work of Duminil-Copin, Hilário, Kozma and Sidoravicius on brochette percolation. Our proof differs, however, in that we do not use Aizenman--Grimmett enhancements or differential inequalities.

In this paper, we explore a novel quaternionic representation of minimal surfaces, drawing an analogy with the well-established theory of Pythagorean Hodograph (PH) curves. By exploiting the algebraic structure of complex quaternions, we introduce a new approach to generating minimal surfaces via quaternionic transformations. This method extends classical Weierstraß-Enneper representations and provides insights into the interplay between quaternionic analysis, PH curves, and minimal surface geometry. Additionally, we discuss the role of the Sylvester equation in this framework and demonstrate practical examples, including the construction of Enneper surface patches. The findings open new avenues in computational geometry and geometric modeling, bridging abstract algebraic structures with practical applications in CAD and computer graphics.",

Earlier results rely upon an asymptotic expansion and subsequent pointwise estimates of the Cauchy--Szegö kernel, but these are unavailable in our setting of minimal regularity {of $bD$}; at the same time, more recent techniques that allow to handle domains with minimal regularity (Lanzani--Stein 2017) are not applicable to $A_p$-measures. It turns out that the method of {quantitative} extrapolation is an appropriate replacement for the missing tools. To finish, we identify a class of holomorphic Hardy spaces defined with respect to $A_p$-measures for which a meaningful notion of Cauchy--Szegö projection can be defined when $p=2$.",

It is well-known that random lozenge tilings of the hexagon correspond to a two-dimensional determinantal point process via a bijection with ensembles of non-intersecting paths. The starting point of our analysis is a formula for the correlation kernel due to Duits and Kuijlaars which involves the Christoffel-Darboux kernel of a particular family of non-Hermitian orthogonal polynomials. Our main results are split into two parts: the first part concerns the family of orthogonal polynomials, and the second concerns the behavior of the boundary of the so-called arctic curve. In the first half, we identify the orthogonal polynomials as a non-standard instance of little $q$-Jacobi polynomials and compute their large degree asymptotics in the $q \\to 1$ regime. A consequence of this analysis is a proof that the zeros of the orthogonal polynomials accumulate on an arc of a circle and an asymptotic formula for the Christoffel-Darboux kernel. In the second half, we use these asymptotics to show that the boundary of the liquid region converges to the Airy process, in the sense of finite dimensional distributions, away from the boundary of the hexagon. At inflection points of the arctic curve, we show that we do not need to subtract/add a parabola to the Airy line ensemble, and this effect persists at distances which are $o(N^{-2/9})$ in the tangent direction.",

In the present paper, a generalisation of the classical models of Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko bending beams based on the mentioned work is proposed. The former is still composed of only one unidimensional scalar field, while the later introduces a third unidimensional scalar field, correcting the second order terms. The generalised Euler-Bernoulli beam is then shown to exhibit curvature (i.e. disclinations) linked to a third order derivative of the displacement, but no torsion (dislocations). Parallelly, the generalised Timoshenko beam is shown to exhibit both curvature and torsion, where the former is linked to the non-holonomy introduced in the generalisation. Lastly, using variational calculus, asymptotic values for the value taken by the curvature in static equilibrium are obtained when the second order contribution becomes negligible; along with an equation for the torsion in the generalised Timoshenko beam.",

In this work, we study combinatorial bifurcations within the framework of combinatorial multivector field theory--a young but already well-established theory providing a combinatorial model for continuous-time dynamical systems (or simply, flows). We introduce Conley-Morse persistence barcode, a compact algebraic descriptor of combinatorial bifurcations. The barcode captures structural changes in a dynamical system at the level of Morse decompositions and provides a characterization of the nature of observed transitions in terms of the Conley index. The construction of Conley-Morse persistence barcode builds upon ideas from topological data analysis (TDA). Specifically, we consider a persistence module obtained from a zigzag filtration of topological pairs (formed by index pairs defining the Conley index) over a poset. Using gentle algebras, we prove that this module decomposes into simple intervals (bars) and compute them with algorithms from TDA known for processing zigzag filtrations.",

We state a stability criterion that allows to determine if a steady state is linearly stable or unstable depending on the delay and the interaction between neurons.

The classical shrinking target problem concerns points returning infinitely many times to a sequence of shrinking balls. In the iterated function system context, the shrinking balls problem is only well tractable in the case of similarity maps, but the case of affine maps is more elusive due to many geometric-dynamical complications.\nIn the current work, we push through these complications and compute the Hausdorff dimension of a set recurring to a shrinking target of geometric balls in some affine iterated function systems. For these results, we have pinpointed a representative class of affine iterated function systems, consisting of a pair of diagonal affine maps, that was introduced by Przytycki and Urbański. The analysis splits into many sub-cases according to the type of the centre point of the targets, and the relative sizes of the targets and the contractions of the maps, illustrating the array of challenges of going beyond affine maps with nice projections. The proofs require heavy machinery from, and expand, the theory of Bernoulli convolutions.",

The key tool for this is that every extremal norm of a matrix set admits an Auerbach basis; any such basis gives rise to a desired coordinate system. An immediate implication is that all diagonal entries - equivalently, all one-dimensional principal submatrices - are uniformly bounded above by the JSR. It is shown that the corresponding bounding property does not hold for higher dimensional principal submatrices. More precisely, we construct finite matrix sets for which, across the entire similarity orbit, the JSRs of all higher-dimensional principal submatrices exceed that of the original set. This shows that the bounding result does not extend to submatrices of dimension greater than one. The constructions rely on tools from the geometry of finite-dimensional Banach spaces, with projection constants of norms playing a key role. Additional bounds of the JSR of principal submatrices are obtained using John's ellipsoidal approximation and known estimates for projection constants.",

    "summary": "In this paper we investigate stability of travelling wave solutions to a class of reaction-diffusion equations perturbed by infinite-dimensional additive noise with Hölder continuous paths, covering in particular fractional Brownian motion with general Hurst index. We obtain long- and short time asymptotic error bounds on the maximal distance from the solution of the stochastic reaction-diffusion equation to the orbit of travelling wave fronts. These bounds, in terms of Hurst index and Hölder exponent, apply to a large class of infinite-dimensional self-similar drivers with Hölder continuous paths, such as linear fractional stable motion. We find that for short times, higher Hurst indices imply higher stability, while for large times, the difference of Hurst index to Hölder exponent influences the size of scaling exponents of the noise amplitude that are sufficient to ensure stability.",

We reveal an explicit nested recursion defining block sequences B(n) and pillar sequences P(n) via B(n+1) = B(n) P(n) B(n) and P(n+1) = G(R(P(n)), 3), where G generates runs from vector R(P(n)). We prove B(n) are prefixes of K(1,3) converging to it, and B(n+1) = G(R(B(n)), 1), directly reflecting the Kolakoski self-encoding property. We derive recurrences for lengths |B(n)|, |P(n)| and symbol counts, confirming growth governed by alpha (limit |B(n+1)|/|B(n)| = alpha as n -> infinity). If block/pillar densities converge, they must equal d. This constructive framework provides an alternative perspective on K(1,3)'s regularity, consistent with known results from substitution dynamics.",

Precisely, for each operator $T $ in $B(H)$ and every $\\varepsilon >0$, is there a trace-class operator $K$ such that $T+K$ is irreducible and $\\Vert K \\Vert_1 < \\varepsilon$?\nFor $p>1$, to prove the $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert_p$-norm density of irreducible operators in $B(H)$, a type of Weyl-von Neumann theorem effects as a key technique. But the traditional method fails for the case $p=1$, where by $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert_p$-norm we denote the Schatten $p$-norm.\nIn the current paper, for a large family of operators in $B(H)$, we give the above long-term problem an affirmative answer. The result is derived from a combination of techniques in both operator theory and operator algebras.

The key tool for this is that every extremal norm of a matrix set admits an Auerbach basis; any such basis gives rise to a desired coordinate system. An immediate implication is that all diagonal entries - equivalently, all one-dimensional principal submatrices - are uniformly bounded above by the JSR. It is shown that the corresponding bounding property does not hold for higher dimensional principal submatrices. More precisely, we construct finite matrix sets for which, across the entire similarity orbit, the JSRs of all higher-dimensional principal submatrices exceed that of the original set. This shows that the bounding result does not extend to submatrices of dimension greater than one. The constructions rely on tools from the geometry of finite-dimensional Banach spaces, with projection constants of norms playing a key role. Additional bounds of the JSR of principal submatrices are obtained using John's ellipsoidal approximation and known estimates for projection constants.",

Underlying the tubal tensor framework is a view of a tensor as a matrix of finite sized tubes. In this work, we lay the mathematical and computational foundations for working with tensors with infinite size tubes: matrices whose elements are elements from a separable Hilbert space. A key challenge is that existence of important desired matrix-mimetic features of tubal tensors rely on the existence of a unit element in the ring of tubes. Such unit element cannot exist for tubes which are elements of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. We sidestep this issue by embedding the tubal space in a commutative unital C*-algebra of bounded operators. The resulting quasitubal algebra recovers the structural properties needed for decomposition and low-rank approximation. In addition to laying the theoretical groundwork for working with tubal tensors with infinite dimensional tubes, we discuss computational aspects of our construction, and provide a numerical illustration where we compute a finite dimensional approximation to a infinitely-sized synthetic tensor using our theory.

It is not immediately clear what would be a natural generalization for functions whose domain and range are in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces. In this article, we analyze this problem, by first arriving at what we think is the appropriate question to ask, and then restricting to linear transformations. It turns out that the matrices that will satisfy an appropriate version of the Intermediate Value Theorem are the so called {\\em monotone} and {\\em weakly monotone} matrices, which have applications in numerical approximation of the solutions to systems of linear equations.",

In this work, we study the generalization of the uniform downsampling layer for group equivariant architectures, e.g., G-CNNs. That is, we aim to downsample signals (feature maps) on general finite groups with anti-aliasing. This involves the following: (a) Given a finite group and a downsampling rate, we present an algorithm to form a suitable choice of subgroup. (b) Given a group and a subgroup, we study the notion of bandlimited-ness and propose how to perform anti-aliasing. Notably, our method generalizes the notion of downsampling based on classical sampling theory. When the signal is on a cyclic group, i.e., periodic, our method recovers the standard downsampling of an ideal low-pass filter followed by a subsampling operation. Finally, we conducted experiments on image classification tasks demonstrating that the proposed downsampling operation improves accuracy, better preserves equivariance, and reduces model size when incorporated into G-equivariant networks",

This paper advances the classification program for $m$-PDRs with prescribed valency. Building on Du et al.'s complete classification of unrestricted $m$-PDRs \\cite{du4} (2021), we focus on the unresolved valency-specific cases. For digraphs, the minimal nontrivial valencies are $k=2$ (even) and $k=3$ (odd), since a connected digraph of valency one is just a directed cycle. While Du et al. \\cite{du3} recently classified valency 2 $m$-POSRs for groups generated by at most two elements - where $m$-POSRs are necessarily $m$-PDRs by definition - the valency 3 case remains open. Since all finite simple groups are two-generated, we investigate $m$-PDRs of valency 3 for groups generated by at most two elements, and establish a complete classification of nontrivial finite simple groups admitting $m$-PDRs of valency 3.",

    "summary": "In this paper the index of a family of critical points of the systole function on Teichmüller space is calculated. The members of this family are interesting in that their existence implies the existence of strata in the Thurston spine for which the systoles do not determine a basis for the homology of the surface. Previously, index calculations of critical points with this pathological feature were impossible, because the only known examples were in surfaces with huge genus.\nA related concept is that of a ``minimal filling subset'' of the systoles at the critical point. Such minimal filling sets are studied, as they relate to the dimension of the Thurston spine near the critical point. We find an example of a minimal filling set of simple closed geodesics in genus 5 with cardinality 8, that are presumably realised as systoles. More generally, we determine the smallest and largest cardinality of a minimal filling set related to a tesselation of a hyperbolic surface by regular, right-angled $m$-gons for $m \\in \\{ 5, 6, 7 \\}$. For this, we use integer linear programming together with a hand-tailored symmetry breaking technique.",

We give a description of the geodesics of this metric. We show that this metric is Finsler, and give a formula for its infinitesimal Finsler structure. We then generalise this study to the case of convex Euclidean polygons in the Euclidean plane and to surfaces equipped with singular Euclidean structures with an underlying fixed triangulation. After developing some elements of the theory of completeness and completion of asymmetric metrics which is adapted to our setting, we study the completeness of the metrics we introduce in this paper. These problems and the results obtained are motivated by Thurston's work developed in his paper Minimal stretch maps between hyperbolic surfaces. We provide an analogue of Thurston's theory in a Euclidean setting.",

    "summary": "This paper develops a framework for the Hamiltonian quantization of complex Chern-Simons theory with gauge group $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$ at an even level $k\\in\\mathbb{Z}_+$. Our approach follows the procedure of combinatorial quantization to construct the operator algebras of quantum holonomies on 2-surfaces and develop the representation theory. The $*$-representation of the operator algebra is carried by the infinite dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_{\\vec{\\lambda}}$ and closely connects to the infinite-dimensional $*$-representation of the quantum deformed Lorentz group $\\mathscr{U}_{\\mathbf{q}}(sl_2)\\otimes \\mathscr{U}_{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{q}}}(sl_2)$, where $\\mathbf{q}=\\exp[\\frac{2\\pi i}{k}(1+b^2)]$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{q}}=\\exp[\\frac{2\\pi i}{k}(1+b^{-2})]$ with $|b|=1$. The quantum group $\\mathscr{U}_{\\mathbf{q}}(sl_2)\\otimes \\mathscr{U}_{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{q}}}(sl_2)$ also emerges from the quantum gauge transformations of the complex Chern-Simons theory. Focusing on a $m$-holed sphere $\\Sigma_{0,m}$, the physical Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_{phys}$ is identified by imposing the gauge invariance and the flatness constraint. The states in $\\mathcal{H}_{phys}$ are the $\\mathscr{U}_{\\mathbf{q}}(sl_2)\\otimes \\mathscr{U}_{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{q}}}(sl_2)$-invariant linear functionals on a dense domain in $\\mathcal{H}_{\\vec{\\lambda}}$. Finally, we demonstrate that the physical Hilbert space carries a Fenchel-Nielsen representation, where a set of Wilson loop operators associated with a pants decomposition of $\\Sigma_{0,m}$ are diagonalized.",

Existing secure SemCom solutions often lack explicit control over security. To address this, we propose a coding-enhanced jamming approach for secure SemCom over wiretap channels. This approach integrates deep joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC) with neural network-based digital modulation, enabling controlled jamming through two-layer superposition coding. The outer constellation sequence encodes the source image, while the inner constellation sequence, derived from a secret image, acts as the jamming signal. By minimizing the mutual information between the outer and inner constellation sequences, the jamming effect is enhanced. The jamming signal is superposed on the outer constellation sequence, preventing the eavesdropper from recovering the source image. The power allocation coefficient (PAC) in the superposition coding can be adjusted to control system security. Experiments show that our approach matches existing methods in security while significantly improving reconstruction performance across varying channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and compression ratios.",

These divergence families include the density power divergence and the $\\gamma$-divergence as special cases. First, we prove that the intersection of the Hölder divergence and the FDPD is limited to a general divergence family introduced by Jones et al. (Biometrika, 2001). Subsequently, motivated by the fact that Hölder's inequality is used in the proofs of nonnegativity for both the Hölder divergence and the FDPD, we define a generalized divergence family, referred to as the $\\xi$-Hölder divergence. The nonnegativity of the $\\xi$-Hölder divergence is established through a combination of the inequalities used to prove the nonnegativity of the Hölder divergence and the FDPD. Furthermore, we derive an inequality between the composite scoring rules corresponding to different FDPDs based on the $\\xi$-Hölder divergence. Finally, we prove that imposing the mathematical structure of the Hölder score on a composite scoring rule results in the $\\xi$-Hölder divergence.",

It measures the system's ability to serve multiple users concurrently. Mathematically, the SRR is a polytope in R^k where each dimension corresponds to the service request rate of one of the k data objects. This paper focuses on systems employing a class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes. For each code in the class, we characterize the k axes intercept points of its SRR, and the smallest standard simplex that includes the SRR. We use these results to show that the SRR grows with the increasing number of systematic columns in the generator matrices. We establish a graph-theoretic framework associating this SRR problem with fractional matchings in quasi-uniform hypergraphs. Identifying the SRR polytope is equivalent to determining a particular image of the fractional-matching polytope. We introduce a notion of Greedy Matching and show that it is sufficient to focus on these matchings to characterize the SRR rather than the entire matching polytope. With these tools, we determine the SRR of a large subset of the considered class of codes. Our results generalize previous characterizations of systematic and non-systematic MDS-coded systems, offering a unified framework for analyzing service rate regions of codes.",

We show that this flexibility leads to a considerable reduction in the error probability compared to a fixed number of reads, not only in terms of constants in the error exponent but also in the scaling laws. This is shown via an achievability result for a suitably-designed protocol, and in certain parameter regimes we additionally establish a matching converse that holds for all protocols within a broader concatenated coding based class.",

    "summary": "In the short block length regime, pre-transformed polar codes together with successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding possess excellent error correction capabilities. However, in practice, the list size is limited due to the suboptimal scaling of the required area in hardware implementations. Automorphism ensemble decoding (AED) can improve performance for a fixed list size by running multiple parallel SCL decodings on permuted received words, yielding a list of estimates from which the final estimate is selected. Yet, AED is limited to appropriately designed polar codes. Subcode ensemble decoding (ScED) was recently proposed for low-density parity-check codes and does not impose such design constraints. It uses multiple decodings in different subcodes, ensuring that the selected subcodes jointly cover the original code. We extend ScED to polar codes by expressing polar subcodes through suitable pre-transformations (PTs). To this end, we describe a framework classifying pre-transformations for pre-transformed polar codes based on their role in encoding and decoding. Within this framework, we propose a new type of PT enabling ScED for polar codes, analyze its properties, and discuss how to construct an efficient ensemble.",

In Part I of the two-part paper, we have investigated securely computing linear functions with the wiretapper who can eavesdrop any edge subset up to a certain size r, referred to as the security level, where the security function is the identity function. The notion of this security is called source security. In the current paper, we consider another interesting model which is the same as the above one except that the security function is identical to the target function, i.e., we need to protect the information on the target function from being leaked to the wiretapper. The notion of this security is called target-function security. We first prove a non-trivial upper bound on the secure computing capacity, which is applicable to arbitrary network topologies and arbitrary security levels. In particular, when the security level r is equal to 0, the upper bound reduces to the computing capacity without security consideration. Further, from an algebraic point of view, we prove two equivalent conditions for target-function security and source security for the existence of the corresponding linear function-computing secure network codes. With them, for any linear function over a given finite field, we develop a code construction of linear secure network codes for target-function security and thus obtain a lower bound on the secure computing capacity; and also generalize the code construction developed in Part I for source security.",

Recent theoretical advancements highlight that an ISAC system will be overwhelmed by the increasing number of active devices, driven by the growth of massive machine-type communication (mMTC). To meet the demands of future mMTC network, fundamental solutions are required that ensure robust capacity while maintaining favorable energy and spectral efficiency. One promising approach to support emerging massive connectivity is the development of systems based on the unsourced ISAC (UNISAC) framework. This paper proposes a spectrum-sharing compressive sensing-based UNISAC (SSCS-UNISAC) and offers insights into the practical design of UNISAC multiple access codes. In this framework, both communication signals (data transmission) and sensing signals (e.g., radar echoes) overlap within finite channel uses and are transmitted via the proposed UNISAC protocol. The proposed decoder exhibits robust performance, providing 20-30 dB capacity gains compared to conventional protocols such as TDMA and ALOHA. Numerical results validate the promising performance of the proposed scheme.",

We present two CE strategies based on the activation of different FAS ports, namely alternate ports and partial ports CE.

Based on the measurement results, the propagation phenomena are analyzed in detail and the channel characteristics are calculated and statistically modeled. Furthermore, a digital twin enabled channel model (DTECM) is proposed, which generates THz channel responses in a hybrid manner. Specifically, the dominant paths are generated deterministically by using the ray-tracing technique and CV methods. Apart from the path gains determined by ray-tracing, the additional foliage loss is accurately modeled based on foliage information extracted from panoramic pictures. To maintain a low computational complexity for the DTECM, non-dominant paths are then generated statistically. Numeric results reveal that compared to the traditional statistical channel models, the DTECM reduces the path loss modeling error from 14~dB to 4~dB, showing its great superiority. Furthermore, a preliminary link performance evaluation using the DTECM indicates that THz UMa is feasible, though requiring high antenna gains and coverage extension techniques to achieve high spectral efficiencies and wide coverage.",

First, we synthesize the worst-case stealthy attack in nonlinear CPS using the path integral approach. Second, we consider how a controller can mitigate the impact of such stealthy attacks by formulating a minimax KL control problem, yielding a zero-sum game between the attacker and the controller.

We validate our approach using unicycle navigation and cruise control problems, demonstrating how an attacker can covertly drive the system into unsafe regions, and how the controller can adapt her policy to combat the worst-case attacks.",

Our design features two techniques: ciphertext packing and lattice packing. First, we extend the Peikert-Vaikuntanathan-Waters (PVW) method to the Kyber: $\\ell$ plaintexts are packed into a single ciphertext. This scheme is referred to as P$_\\ell$-Kyber. We prove that the P$_\\ell$-Kyber is IND-CCA secure under the M-LWE hardness assumption. We show that the decryption decoding noise entries across the $\\ell$ plaintexts (also known as layers) are mutually independent. Second, we propose a cross-layer lattice encoding scheme for the P$_\\ell$-Kyber, where every $\\ell$ cross-layer information symbols are encoded to a lattice point. This way we obtain a \\emph{coded} P$_\\ell$-Kyber, where the decoding noise entries for each lattice point are mutually independent. Therefore, the decryption failure rate (DFR) analysis does not require the assumption of independence among the decryption decoding noise entries. Both DFR and communication cost (CER) are greatly decreased thanks to ciphertext packing and lattice packing. Finally, we demonstrate that with $\\ell=24$ and Leech lattice encoder, the proposed coded P$_\\ell$-KYBER1024 achieves DFR $<2^{-281}$ and CER $ = 4.6$, i.e., a decrease of CER by $90\\%$ compared to KYBER1024.",

    "summary": "We propose a method for constructing quantum error-correcting codes based on non-binary low-density parity-check codes with girth 16. In conventional constructions using circulant permutation matrices, the girth is upper-bounded by 12, which limits the suppression of harmful short cycles. Our construction employs affine permutation matrices and a randomized sequential selection procedure designed to eliminate short cycles, which are known to limit decoding performance.\nJoint belief propagation decoding is applied over depolarizing channels. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed codes reduce the number of low-weight codewords in $C_X \\setminus C_Z^\\perp$ and $C_Z \\setminus C_X^\\perp$, and thus have the potential to suppress error floors. In addition, we obtain a significantly improved upper bound on the minimum distance, which we conjecture to be tight.",

    "summary": "This paper considers the quality-of-service (QoS)-based joint beamforming and compression design problem in the downlink cooperative cellular network, where multiple relay-like base stations (BSs), connected to the central processor via rate-limited fronthaul links, cooperatively transmit messages to the users. The problem of interest is formulated as the minimization of the total transmit power of the BSs, subject to all users' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints and all BSs' fronthaul rate constraints. In this paper, we first show that there is no duality gap between the considered joint optimization problem and its Lagrangian dual by showing the tightness of its semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Then, we propose an efficient algorithm based on the above duality result for solving the considered problem. The proposed algorithm judiciously exploits the special structure of an enhanced Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the considered problem and finds the solution that satisfies the enhanced KKT conditions via two fixed point iterations. Two key features of the proposed algorithm are: (1) it is able to detect whether the considered problem is feasible or not and find its globally optimal solution when it is feasible; (2) it is highly efficient because both of the fixed point iterations in the proposed algorithm are linearly convergent and evaluating the functions in the fixed point iterations are computationally cheap. Numerical results show the global optimality and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

    "summary": "By the seminal paper of Claude Shannon \\cite{Shannon48}, the computation of the capacity of a discrete memoryless channel has been considered as one of the most important and fundamental problems in Information Theory. Nearly 50 years ago, Arimoto and Blahut independently proposed identical algorithms to solve this problem in their seminal papers \\cite{Arimoto1972AnAF, Blahut1972ComputationOC}. The Arimoto-Blahut algorithm was proven to converge to the capacity of the channel as $t \\to \\infty$ with the convergence rate upper bounded by $O\\left(\\log(m)/t\\right)$, where $m$ is the size of the input distribution, and being inverse exponential when there is a unique solution in the interior of the input probability simplex \\cite{Arimoto1972AnAF}. Recently it was proved, in \\cite{Nakagawa2020AnalysisOT}, that the convergence rate is at worst inverse linear $O(1/t)$ in some specific cases.\nIn this paper, we revisit this fundamental algorithm looking at the rate of convergence to the capacity and the time complexity, given $m,n$, where $n$ is size of the output of the channel, focusing on the approximation of the capacity. We prove that the rate of convergence to an $\\varepsilon$-optimal solution, for any sufficiently small constant $\\varepsilon > 0$, is inverse exponential $O\\left(\\log(m)/c^t\\right)$, for a constant $c > 1$ and $O\\left(\\log \\left(\\log (m)/\\varepsilon\\right)\\right)$ at most iterations, implying $O\\left(m n\\log \\left(\\log (m)/\\varepsilon\\right)\\right)$ total complexity of the algorithm.",

    "summary": "The growing privacy concerns in distributed learning have led to the widespread adoption of secure aggregation techniques in distributed machine learning systems, such as federated learning. Motivated by a coded gradient aggregation problem in a user-helper-master hierarchical network setting with straggling communication links, we formulate a new secure hierarchical coded gradient aggregation problem. In our setting, \\( K \\) users communicate with the master through an intermediate layer of \\( N \\) helpers, who can communicate with each other. With a resiliency threshold of \\( N_r \\) for straggling communication links, and at most \\( T \\) colluding helpers and any number of colluding users, the master aims to recover the sum of all users' gradients while remaining unaware of any individual gradient that exceeds the expected sum. In addition, helpers cannot infer more about users' gradients than what is already known by the colluding users. We propose an achievable scheme where users' upload messages are based on a globally known Vandermonde matrix, and helper communication is facilitated using an extended Vandermonde matrix with special structural properties. A matching converse bound is also derived, establishing the optimal result for this hierarchical coded gradient aggregation problem.",

In essence, an NNC is a duplication channel with structured, Markov inputs, that is corrupted by memoryless noise. We first discuss a (tight) lower bound on the capacity of the NNC in the absence of random noise. Next, we present lower and upper bounds on the channel capacity of general noisy nanopore channels. We then consider two interesting regimes of operation of an NNC: first, where the memory of the input process is large and the random noise introduces erasures, and second, where the rate of measurements of the electric current (also called the sampling rate) is high. For these regimes, we show that it is possible to achieve information rates close to the noise-free capacity, using low-complexity encoding and decoding schemes. In particular, our decoder for the regime of high sampling rates makes use of a change-point detection procedure -- a subroutine of immediate relevance for practitioners.",

We evaluate our method on a channel state information dataset collected indoors with a distributed setup of ESPARGOS Wi-Fi sensing antenna arrays. This scenario can be interpreted as either a multi-static or passive radar system. We demonstrate that passive channel charting outperforms a baseline based on classical triangulation in terms of localization accuracy.

The distributions of the $M$ data sequences belong to $K$ underlying distribution clusters. Existing results on exponentially consistent nonparametric clustering algorithms, like single linkage-based (SLINK) clustering and $k$-medoids distribution clustering, assume that the maximum intra-cluster distance ($d_L$) is smaller than the minimum inter-cluster distance ($d_H$). First, in the fixed sample size (FSS) setting, we show that exponential consistency can be achieved for SLINK clustering under a less strict assumption, $d_I < d_H$, where $d_I$ is the maximum distance between any two sub-clusters of a cluster that partition the cluster. Note that $d_I < d_L$ in general. Thus, our results show that SLINK is exponentially consistent for a larger class of problems than previously known. In our simulations, we also identify examples where $k$-medoids clustering is unable to find the true clusters, but SLINK is exponentially consistent. Then, we propose a sequential clustering algorithm, named SLINK-SEQ, based on SLINK and prove that it is also exponentially consistent. Simulation results show that the SLINK-SEQ algorithm requires fewer expected number of samples than the FSS SLINK algorithm for the same probability of error.",

In this letter, we propose a ROMA-aided multi-user MIMO communication system to fully enhance the efficiency and reliability of system transmissions. By deploying ROMA panels at both the transmitter and receiver sides, and jointly optimizing the three-dimensional (3D) rotation angles of each ROMA panel and the relative positions of antenna elements based on the spatial distribution of users and channel state information (CSI), we can achieve the objective of maximizing the average spectral efficiency (SE). Subsequently, we conduct a detailed analysis of the average SE performance of the system under the consideration of maximum ratio (MR) precoding. Due to the non-convexity of the optimization problem in the ROMA multi-user MIMO system, we propose an efficient solution based on an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the AO-based ROMA architecture can significantly improve the average SE. Furthermore, the performance improvement becomes more pronounced as the size of the movable region and the transmission power increase.",

We refer to this type of compactness property as outward compactness, and we show that instances of this type of principle for second-order logic can be used to characterize various large cardinal notions between measurability and extendibility, directly generalizing a classical result of Magidor that characterizes extendible cardinals as the strong compactness cardinals of second-order logic. In addition, we generalize a result of Makowsky that shows that Vopěnka's Principle is equivalent to the existence of compactness cardinals for all abstract logics by characterizing the principle \"Ord is Woodin\" through outward compactness properties of abstract logics.",

The members of this family are interesting in that their existence implies the existence of strata in the Thurston spine for which the systoles do not determine a basis for the homology of the surface. Previously, index calculations of critical points with this pathological feature were impossible, because the only known examples were in surfaces with huge genus.\nA related concept is that of a ``minimal filling subset'' of the systoles at the critical point. Such minimal filling sets are studied, as they relate to the dimension of the Thurston spine near the critical point. We find an example of a minimal filling set of simple closed geodesics in genus 5 with cardinality 8, that are presumably realised as systoles. More generally, we determine the smallest and largest cardinality of a minimal filling set related to a tesselation of a hyperbolic surface by regular, right-angled $m$-gons for $m \\in \\{ 5, 6, 7 \\}$. For this, we use integer linear programming together with a hand-tailored symmetry breaking technique.",

It is well-known that random lozenge tilings of the hexagon correspond to a two-dimensional determinantal point process via a bijection with ensembles of non-intersecting paths. The starting point of our analysis is a formula for the correlation kernel due to Duits and Kuijlaars which involves the Christoffel-Darboux kernel of a particular family of non-Hermitian orthogonal polynomials. Our main results are split into two parts: the first part concerns the family of orthogonal polynomials, and the second concerns the behavior of the boundary of the so-called arctic curve. In the first half, we identify the orthogonal polynomials as a non-standard instance of little $q$-Jacobi polynomials and compute their large degree asymptotics in the $q \\to 1$ regime. A consequence of this analysis is a proof that the zeros of the orthogonal polynomials accumulate on an arc of a circle and an asymptotic formula for the Christoffel-Darboux kernel. In the second half, we use these asymptotics to show that the boundary of the liquid region converges to the Airy process, in the sense of finite dimensional distributions, away from the boundary of the hexagon. At inflection points of the arctic curve, we show that we do not need to subtract/add a parabola to the Airy line ensemble, and this effect persists at distances which are $o(N^{-2/9})$ in the tangent direction.",

In the present paper, a generalisation of the classical models of Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko bending beams based on the mentioned work is proposed. The former is still composed of only one unidimensional scalar field, while the later introduces a third unidimensional scalar field, correcting the second order terms. The generalised Euler-Bernoulli beam is then shown to exhibit curvature (i.e. disclinations) linked to a third order derivative of the displacement, but no torsion (dislocations). Parallelly, the generalised Timoshenko beam is shown to exhibit both curvature and torsion, where the former is linked to the non-holonomy introduced in the generalisation. Lastly, using variational calculus, asymptotic values for the value taken by the curvature in static equilibrium are obtained when the second order contribution becomes negligible; along with an equation for the torsion in the generalised Timoshenko beam.",

Compared with the previous work, our asymptotic error accuracy has been improved from $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{\\log t}t)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. More importantly, by establishing two matrix valued functions, we obtained effective asymptotic errors and successfully constructed asymptotic analysis of the spin-1 GP equation based on the characteristics of the spectral problem, including two cases: (i)coexistence of discrete and continuous spectrum; (ii)only continuous spectrum which considered by Geng's work with error $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{\\log t}t)$. For the case (i), the corresponding asymptotic approximations can be characterized with an $N$-soliton as well as an interaction term between soliton solutions and the dispersion term with diverse residual error order $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$. For the case (ii), the corresponding asymptotic approximations can be characterized with the leading term on the continuous spectrum and the residual error order $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/4})$.

In this paper, we propose a conceptual algebraic description of orbifolds/condensations for arbitrary tangential structures in terms of higher dagger structures and higher idempotents. In particular, we obtain (oriented) orbifold completion from (framed) condensation completion by using a general strictification procedure for higher dagger structures which we describe explicitly in low dimensions; we also discuss the spin and unoriented case. We provide several examples of higher dagger categories, such as those associated to state sum models, (orbifolds of) Landau--Ginzburg models, and truncated affine Rozansky--Witten models. We also explain how their higher dagger structures are naturally induced from rigid symmetric monoidal structures, recontextualizing and extending results from the literature.",

    "summary": "In statistical physics, the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism (also called Nakajima-Zwanzig projection operator formalism) is used to derive a linear integro-differential equation for observables in Hilbert space, the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). This technique relies on the splitting of the dynamics into a projected and an orthogonal part. We prove that the GLE together with the second fluctuation dissipation theorem (2FDT) uniquely define the fluctuating forces as well as the memory kernel. The GLE and 2FDT are an immediate consequence of the existence and uniqueness of solutions of linear Volterra equations. They neither rely on the Dyson identity nor on the concept of orthogonal dynamics. This holds true for autonomous as well as non-autonomous systems. Further results are obtained for the Mori projection for autonomous systems, for which the fluctuating forces are orthogonal to the observable of interest. In particular, we prove that the orthogonal dynamics is a strongly continuous semigroup generated by $\\overline{\\mathcal{QL}}Q$, where $\\mathcal{L}$ is the generator of the time evolution operator, and $\\mathcal{P}=1-\\mathcal{Q}$ is the Mori projection operator. As a consequence, the corresponding orbit maps (e.g. the fluctuating forces) are the unique mild solutions of the associated abstract Cauchy problem. Furthermore, we show that the orthogonal dynamics is a unitary group, if $\\mathcal{L}$ is skew-adjoint. In this case, the fluctuating forces are stationary. In addition, we present a proof of the GLE by means of semigroup theory, and we retrieve the commonly used definitions for the fluctuating forces, memory kernel, and orthogonal dynamics. Our results apply to general autonomous dynamical systems, whose time evolution is given by a strongly continuous semigroup. This includes large classes of systems in classical statistical mechanics.",

We present the first general, convergent computational method for computing the spectra and pseudospectra of nonlinear spectral problems. Our approach uses new results on nonlinear injection moduli and requires only minimal continuity assumptions: specifically, continuity with respect to the gap metric on operator graphs, making it applicable to a broad class of problems. We use the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) hierarchy, which has recently been used to resolve the classical linear problem, to systematically classify the computational complexity of nonlinear spectral problems. Our results establish the optimality of the method and reveal that Hermiticity does not necessarily simplify the computational complexity of these nonlinear problems. Comprehensive examples -- including nonlinear shifts, Klein--Gordon equations, wave equations with acoustic boundary conditions, time-fractional beam equations, and biologically inspired delay differential equations -- demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and broad applicability of our methodology.",

    "summary": "We investigate the properties of a class of piecewise-fractional maps arising from the introduction of an invariance under rescaling into convex quadratic maps. The subsequent maps are quasiconvex, and pseudoconvex on specific convex cones; they can be optimised via exact line search along admissible directions, and the iterates then inherit a bidimensional optimality property. We study the minimisation of such relaxed maps via coordinate descents with gradient-based rules, placing a special emphasis on coordinate directions verifying a maximum-alignment property in the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces related to the underlying positive-semidefinite matrices. In this setting, we illustrate that accounting for the optimal rescaling of the iterates can in certain situations substantially accelerate the unconstrained minimisation of convex quadratic maps.",

We prove the unconditional stability and convergence of the scheme and find a bound on the error. Our estimates are globally optimal for all $0<\\alpha<1$ and pointwise for $\\alpha\\geq 1/2$ in the sense that they reduce to the well-known results for the linear equation. For the semilinear case, our estimates are optimal both globally and locally.

Partial differential equations involving both processes arise for instance in atmospheric circulation models. Through a truncation error analysis, we show that previously formulated semi-Lagrangian exponential schemes are limited to first-order accuracy due to the approximation of the integration factor acting on the discretization of the linear term; we then formulate a new discretization leading to second-order accuracy. Also, a detailed stability study is conducted to compare several Eulerian and semi-Lagrangian exponential schemes, as well as a well-established semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit method, which is used in operational atmospheric models. Numerical simulations of the shallow-water equations on the rotating sphere are performed to assess the orders of convergence, stability properties, and computational cost of each method. The proposed second-order semi-Lagrangian exponential method was shown to be more stable and accurate than the previously formulated schemes of the same class at the expense of larger wall-clock times; however, the method is more stable and has a similar cost compared to the well-established semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit method; therefore, it is a competitive candidate for potential operational applications in atmospheric circulation modeling.",

Specifically, for integration in periodic isotropic Sobolev space and the isotropic Sobolev space with compact support, our approach attains a nearly optimal root mean square error (RMSE) bound. In contrast to previous nearly optimal algorithms, our method exhibits polynomial tractability, ensuring that the number of samples does not scale exponentially with increasing dimensions. Our integration algorithm also enjoys nearly optimal bound for weighted Korobov space. Furthermore, the algorithm can be applied without the need for prior knowledge of weights, distinguishing it from the component-by-component algorithm. For integration in the Wiener algebra, the sample complexity of our algorithm is independent of the decay rate of Fourier coefficients. The effectiveness of the integration is confirmed through numerical experiments.",

In order to understand the phenomenon, we analyze the convergence using the Vandermonde matrix which is defined using the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix. Although eigenvalues alone cannot explain the convergence, they may provide an upper bound of the residual, together with the right hand side vector and the eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix. We show that when the coefficient matrix is diagonalizable, if the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix are clustered, the upper bound of the convergence curve shows superlinear convergence, when the norm of the matrix obtained by decomposing the right hand side vector into the eigenvector components is not so large. We apply the analysis to explain the convergence of inner-iteration preconditioned GMRES for least squares problems.",

Focusing on the prototype function f(x) = sin^2(2 pi k x), we derive an analytical expression for the error governed by a resonance function chi_P(y), closely related to the Dirichlet kernel, roots of unity, and discrete Fourier analysis on the group Z/PZ. This function acts as a spectral filter, connecting the integration error to arithmetic properties such as k/P and geometric phase cancellation, visualized as vector averaging on the unit circle. We introduce the Resonance Bias Framework (RBF), a generalization to arbitrary smooth periodic functions, leading to the error representation B_P[f] = sum_{k != 0} c_k chi_P(k/P). Although this is mathematically equivalent to the classical aliasing sum, it reveals a deeper mechanism: the quadrature error arises from structured resonance rather than random aliasing noise. The RBF thus provides an interpretable framework for understanding integration errors at finite resolution, grounded in number theory and geometry.",

Underlying the tubal tensor framework is a view of a tensor as a matrix of finite sized tubes. In this work, we lay the mathematical and computational foundations for working with tensors with infinite size tubes: matrices whose elements are elements from a separable Hilbert space. A key challenge is that existence of important desired matrix-mimetic features of tubal tensors rely on the existence of a unit element in the ring of tubes. Such unit element cannot exist for tubes which are elements of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. We sidestep this issue by embedding the tubal space in a commutative unital C*-algebra of bounded operators. The resulting quasitubal algebra recovers the structural properties needed for decomposition and low-rank approximation. In addition to laying the theoretical groundwork for working with tubal tensors with infinite dimensional tubes, we discuss computational aspects of our construction, and provide a numerical illustration where we compute a finite dimensional approximation to a infinitely-sized synthetic tensor using our theory. We believe our theory opens new exciting avenues for applying matrix mimetic tensor framework in the context of inherently infinite dimensional problems.",

We reduce the problem to finding a substitution for the radial direction $||x||=f(z)$ so that the effective potential $V(f(z))$ grows exponentially with $z\\rightarrow\\pm\\infty$. Any additive update of $z$ then leads to the desired convergence. We show that choosing this update from a normal distribution with standard deviation $\\sigma\\approx 1/\\sqrt{d}$ in $d$ dimensions yields very good results. We further generalise the previous results on radial updates to a wide class of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms beyond the HMC and we quantify the convergence behaviour of MCMC algorithms with badly chosen radial update. Finally, we apply the radial update to the sampling of heavy-tailed distributions and achieve a speed up of many orders of magnitude.",

A key challenge in this setting is accurately recovering the unknown coefficients in the stochastic dynamics, particularly when driven by Lévy processes with heavy tail effects.

    "summary": "The Lost Notebook of Ramanujan contains a number of beautiful formulas, one of which can be found on its page 220. It involves an interesting function, which we denote as $\\mathcal{F}_1(x)$. In this paper, we show that $\\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ belongs to the category of period functions as it satisfies the period relations of Maass forms in the sense of Lewis and Zagier \\cite{lz}. Hence, we refer to $\\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ as the \\emph{Ramanujan period function}. Moreover, one of the salient aspects of the Ramanujan period function $\\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ that we found out is that it is a Hecke eigenfunction under the action of Hecke operators on the space of periods. We also establish that it naturally appears in a Kronecker limit formula of a certain zeta function, revealing its connections to various topics. Finally, we generalize $\\mathcal{F}_1(x)$ to include a parameter $s,$ connecting our work to the broader theory of period functions developed by Bettin and Conrey \\cite{bc} and Lewis and Zagier \\cite{lz}. We emphasize that Ramanujan was the first to study this function, marking the beginning of the study of period functions.",

More precisely, this doubling map defines a permutation $\\sigma_{2,n}$ and each of $A$ and $B$ counts the number $C_2(n)$ of cycles of $\\sigma_{2,n}$, hence $A=B$. In the first part of this note, we give a direct proof of this last equality. To do so, we consider and study a generalized $(k,n)$-perfect shuffle permutation $\\sigma_{k,n}$, where we multiply by an integer $k\\ge 2$ instead of $2$, and its number $C_k(n)$ of cycles. The second part of this note lists some of the many occurrences and applications of the doubling map and its generalizations in the literature: in mathematics (combinatorics of words, dynamical systems, number theory, correcting algorithms), but also in card-shuffling, juggling, bell-ringing, poetry, and music composition.",

That is, we provide a harmonic preimage of Pei and Wang's generalized Cohen--Eisenstein series under $\\xi_{\\frac{3}{2}-k}$, where $k > 1$. Furthermore, when restricting to prime level, we realize them as outputs of a regularized Shintani theta lift of a higher level holomorphic Eisenstein series, which builds on recent work by Alfes and Schwagenscheidt. Lastly, we evaluate the regularized Millson theta lift of a higher level Maass--Eisenstein series, which is known to be connected to the Shintani theta lift by a differential equation by earlier work of Alfes and Schwagenscheidt.",

Using our statements about Rapoport--Zink spaces, we extend his previous proof from the unramified case to that of all $p$-adic local fields (for odd $p$).

    "summary": "Consider a non-archimedean valuation ring V (K its fraction field, in mixed characteristic): inspired by some views presented by Scholze, we introduce a new point of view on the non-archimedean analytic setting in terms of derived analytic geometry (then associating a \"spectrum\" to each ind-Banach algebra). We want to look at the behaviour of this spectrum from a differential point of view. In such a spectrum, for example, there exist open subsets having functions with log-growth as sections for the structural sheaf. In this framework, a transfer theorem for the log-growth of solutions of p-adic differential equations can be interpreted as a continuity theorem (analogue to the transfer theorem for their radii of convergence in the Berkovich spaces). As a dividend of such a theory, we define a new cohomology theory in terms of the Hodge-completed derived de Rham cohomology of the ind-Banach derived analytic space associated to a smooth k-scheme, X_k (k residual field of V), via the use of \"tempered tubes\".\nWe finally compare our tempered de Rham cohomology with crystalline cohomology.",

    "summary": "We study the trapezoidal rule for periodic functions on uniform grids and show that the quadrature error exhibits a rich deterministic structure, beyond traditional asymptotic or statistical interpretations. Focusing on the prototype function f(x) = sin^2(2 pi k x), we derive an analytical expression for the error governed by a resonance function chi_P(y), closely related to the Dirichlet kernel, roots of unity, and discrete Fourier analysis on the group Z/PZ. This function acts as a spectral filter, connecting the integration error to arithmetic properties such as k/P and geometric phase cancellation, visualized as vector averaging on the unit circle. We introduce the Resonance Bias Framework (RBF), a generalization to arbitrary smooth periodic functions, leading to the error representation B_P[f] = sum_{k != 0} c_k chi_P(k/P). Although this is mathematically equivalent to the classical aliasing sum, it reveals a deeper mechanism: the quadrature error arises from structured resonance rather than random aliasing noise. The RBF thus provides an interpretable framework for understanding integration errors at finite resolution, grounded in number theory and geometry.",

Through the research, a long-standing unsolved problem inquires: is the set of irreducible operators dense in $B(H)$ with respect to the trace-class norm topology? Precisely, for each operator $T $ in $B(H)$ and every $\\varepsilon >0$, is there a trace-class operator $K$ such that $T+K$ is irreducible and $\\Vert K \\Vert_1 < \\varepsilon$?\nFor $p>1$, to prove the $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert_p$-norm density of irreducible operators in $B(H)$, a type of Weyl-von Neumann theorem effects as a key technique. But the traditional method fails for the case $p=1$, where by $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert_p$-norm we denote the Schatten $p$-norm.\nIn the current paper, for a large family of operators in $B(H)$, we give the above long-term problem an affirmative answer. The result is derived from a combination of techniques in both operator theory and operator algebras.

Solving OCPs with singular arcs often requires tailored treatments, suitable for offline trajectory optimization. This approach can become increasingly impractical for online closed-loop implementations, especially for large-scale engineering problems. Recent development of Integrated Residual Methods (IRM) have indicated their suitability for handling singular arcs; the convergence of error measures in IRM automatically suppresses singular arc-induced fluctuations and leads to non-fluctuating solutions more suitable for practical problems. Through several examples, we demonstrate the advantages of solving OCPs with singular arcs using {IRM} under an economic model predictive control framework. In particular, the following observations are made: (i) IRM does not require special treatment for singular arcs, (ii) it solves the OCPs reliably with singular arc fluctuation suppressed, and (iii) the closed-loop results closely match the analytic optimal solutions.",

    "summary": "Contraction metrics are crucial in control theory because they provide a powerful framework for analyzing stability, robustness, and convergence of various dynamical systems. However, identifying these metrics for complex nonlinear systems remains an open challenge due to the lack of scalable and effective tools. This paper explores the approach of learning verifiable contraction metrics parametrized as neural networks (NNs) for discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems. While prior works on formal verification of contraction metrics for general nonlinear systems have focused on convex optimization methods (e.g. linear matrix inequalities, etc) under the assumption of continuously differentiable dynamics, the growing prevalence of NN-based controllers, often utilizing ReLU activations, introduces challenges due to the non-smooth nature of the resulting closed-loop dynamics. To bridge this gap, we establish a new sufficient condition for establishing formal neural contraction metrics for general discrete-time nonlinear systems assuming only the continuity of the dynamics. We show that from a computational perspective, our sufficient condition can be efficiently verified using the state-of-the-art neural network verifier $\\alpha,\\!\\beta$-CROWN, which scales up non-convex neural network verification via novel integration of symbolic linear bound propagation and branch-and-bound. Built upon our analysis tool, we further develop a learning method for synthesizing neural contraction metrics from sampled data. Finally, our approach is validated through the successful synthesis and verification of NN contraction metrics for various nonlinear examples.",

Traditional methods like dynamic programming are often intractable for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems due to the curse of dimensionality. This dissertation explores the path integral control framework as a scalable, sampling-based alternative. By reformulating SOC problems as expectations over stochastic trajectories, it enables efficient policy synthesis via Monte Carlo sampling and supports real-time implementation through GPU parallelization.\nWe apply this framework to six classes of SOC problems: Chance-Constrained SOC, Stochastic Differential Games, Deceptive Control, Task Hierarchical Control, Risk Mitigation of Stealthy Attacks, and Discrete-Time LQR. A sample complexity analysis for the discrete-time case is also provided. These contributions establish a foundation for simulator-driven autonomy in complex, uncertain environments.",

    "summary": "Bilevel optimization is a fundamental tool in hierarchical decision-making and has been widely applied to machine learning tasks such as hyperparameter tuning, meta-learning, and continual learning. While significant progress has been made in bilevel optimization, existing methods predominantly focus on the {nonconvex-strongly convex, or the} nonconvex-PL settings, leaving the more general nonconvex-nonconvex framework underexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by developing an efficient gradient-based method inspired by the recently proposed Relaxed Gradient Flow (RXGF) framework with a continuous-time dynamic. In particular, we introduce a discretized variant of RXGF and formulate convex quadratic program subproblems with closed-form solutions. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis, demonstrating that under the existence of a KKT point and a regularity assumption {(lower-level gradient PL assumption)}, our method achieves an iteration complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^{1.5})$ in terms of the squared norm of the KKT residual for the reformulated problem. Moreover, even in the absence of the regularity assumption, we establish an iteration complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^{3})$ for the same metric. Through extensive numerical experiments on convex and nonconvex synthetic benchmarks and a hyper-data cleaning task, we illustrate the efficiency and scalability of our approach.",

    "summary": "Due to increased energy demand and environmental concerns such as greenhouse gas emissions and natural resources depletion, optimizing energy and raw materials usage has recently drawn much attention. Achieving more synergy between different energy sectors and manufacturing processes could lead to substantial improvements. Energy hubs are already well-known solutions for studying multi-carrier energy systems. In the present study, a multi-carrier hub is defined as a geographic area where different processes take place to convert energy and material flows possibly consumed locally, stored, or exported. Hub boundaries correspond to an area small enough to neglect losses when energy and materials flows are exchanged between the processes. A general formulation is introduced to model such a hub. This formalism encompasses all the possible configurations without limitations or preconceptions regarding used carriers or processes' architecture. For this purpose, a new hub representation is proposed that allows optimization while considering all possible arrangements (parallel, serial, or a combination of them). It is implemented in a framework that allows the creation of several multi-carrier hubs and connecting some of them to exchange flows through dedicated networks. The formalism is based on linear programming (LP). The features of the developed framework are illustrated by a case study consisting of a network made of three hubs and considering heat, electricity, water, and hydrogen this http URL study aims to optimally schedule processes usage and materials and energy storage to minimize the cost of imported resources. The study is done in a short-term period. It shows the benefits of synergy between the different processes in the hub.",

Furthermore, we characterize the topology of networks (which we call X-networks) in which the introduction of heterogeneous local dynamics is not necessary for structural output controllability, as the latter can be attained by suitable higher-order subsystems with homogeneous internal dynamics.",

    "summary": "Water scarcity and the low quality of wastewater produced in industrial applications present significant challenges, particularly in managing fresh water intake and reusing residual quantities. These issues affect various industries, compelling plant owners and managers to optimise water resources within their process networks. To address this cross-sector business requirement, we propose a Decision Support System (DSS) designed to capture key network components, such as inlet streams, processes, and outlet streams. Data provided to the DSS are exploited by an optimisation module, which supports both network design and operational decisions. This module is coupled with a generic mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model, which is linearised into a compact mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation capable of delivering fast optimal solutions across various network designs and input parameterisations. Additionally, a Constraint Programming (CP) approach is incorporated to handle nonlinear expressions through straightforward modeling. This state-of-the-art generalised framework enables broad applicability across a wide range of real-world scenarios, setting it apart from the conventional reliance on customised solutions designed for specific use cases. The proposed framework was tested on 500 synthetic data instances inspired by historical data from three case studies. The obtained results confirm the validity, computational competence and practical impact of our approach both among their operational and network design phases, demonstrating significant improvements over current practices. Notably, the proposed approach achieved a 17.6% reduction in freshwater intake in a chemical industry case and facilitated the reuse of nearly 90% of wastewater in an oil refinery case.",

We study the minimisation of such relaxed maps via coordinate descents with gradient-based rules, placing a special emphasis on coordinate directions verifying a maximum-alignment property in the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces related to the underlying positive-semidefinite matrices.

The contribution of the paper is rooted in a measured-state initialization strategy. First, due to the nonzero probability of violating chance-constraints in the case of unbounded noise, we introduce ellipsoidal-based probabilistic reachable sets and we include constraint relaxations to recover recursive feasibility conditioned to the measured state. Second, we prove that the solution of this novel SMPC scheme guarantees closed-loop chance constraints satisfaction under minimum relaxation. Last, we demonstrate that, in expectation, the need of relaxing the constraints vanishes over time, which leads the closed-loop trajectories steered towards the unconstrained LQR invariant region. This novel SMPC scheme is proven to satisfy the recursive feasibility conditioned to the state realization, and its superiority with respect to open-loop initialization schemes is shown through numerical examples.",

We find that user distance to stations, proximity to home areas, and the number of outlets at each station are significant factors for predicting station usage. Additionally, amenities near charging stations have a neutral effect overall, with some users demonstrating strong preference or aversion for these locations. High variability among the preferences of users highlight the importance of models which incorporate panel effects. Moreover, integrating mixed logit models within the optimization of charging station network design yields high-quality solutions, even when evaluated under other model specifications.",

Motivated by the challenges arising from both randomness and nonlinearity, we develop a globally convergent iterative regularization method that combines Carleman estimate with fixed-point iteration. Our approach enables the reconstruction of the unknown source function from partial lateral Cauchy data, without requiring a good initial guess. We establish a new Carleman estimate for stochastic hyperbolic equations and prove the convergence of the proposed method in weighted spaces. Furthermore, we design an efficient numerical algorithm that avoids solving backward stochastic partial differential equations and is robust to randomness in both the model and the data. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.",

However, it remains unclear whether fixed-degree SoS proofs can be automated [O'Donnell (2017)]. Indeed, there are examples of polynomial systems with bounded coefficients that admit low-degree SoS proofs, but these proofs necessarily involve numbers with an exponential number of bits, implying that low-degree SoS proofs cannot always be found efficiently.\nA sufficient condition derived from the Nullstellensatz proof system [Raghavendra and Weitz (2017)] identifies cases where bit complexity issues can be circumvented. One of the main problems left open by Raghavendra and Weitz is proving any result for refutations, as their condition applies only to polynomial systems with a large set of solutions.\nIn this work, we broaden the class of polynomial systems for which degree-$d$ SoS proofs can be automated. To achieve this, we develop a new criterion and we demonstrate how our criterion applies to polynomial systems beyond the scope of Raghavendra and Weitz's result. In particular, we establish a separation for instances arising from Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). Moreover, our result extends to refutations, establishing that polynomial-time refutation is possible for broad classes of polynomial time solvable constraint problems, highlighting a first advancement in this area.",

    "summary": "Optimal control problems with nonsmooth objectives and nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) constraints are challenging, mainly because of the underlying nonsmooth and nonconvex structures and the demanding computational cost for solving multiple high-dimensional and ill-conditioned systems after mesh-based discretization. To mitigate these challenges numerically, we propose an operator learning approach in combination with an effective primal-dual optimization idea which can decouple the treatment of the control and state variables so that each of the resulting iterations only requires solving two PDEs. Our main purpose is to construct neural surrogate models for the involved PDEs by operator learning, allowing the solution of a PDE to be obtained with only a forward pass of the neural network. The resulting algorithmic framework offers a hybrid approach that combines the efficiency and generalization of operator learning with the model-based nature and structure-friendly efficiency of primal-dual-based algorithms. The primal-dual-based operator learning approach offers numerical methods that are mesh-free, easy to implement, and adaptable to various optimal control problems with nonlinear PDEs. It is notable that the neural surrogate models can be reused across iterations and parameter settings, hence retraining of neural networks can be avoided and computational cost can be substantially alleviated. We affirmatively validate the efficiency of the primal-dual-based operator learning approach across a range of typical optimal control problems with nonlinear PDEs.",

In contrast to the approaches based on mixed-integer optimization models in existing works, our approach focuses on the minimum separation times between aircraft by introducing some necessary assumptions and new concepts including relevance, breakpoint aircraft, path and class-monotonically-decreasing sequence. Four scheduling problems are discussed including landing scheduling problem, takeoff scheduling problem, and mixed landing and takeoff scheduling problems on a same runway and on dual runways with the consideration of conversions between different aircraft sequences in typical scenarios. Two real-time optimal algorithms are proposed for the four scheduling problems by fully exploiting the combinations of different classes of aircraft, and necessary definitions, lemmas and theorems are presented for the optimal convergence of the algorithms. Numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. In particular, when $100$ aircraft are considered, by using the algorithm in this paper, the optimal solution can be obtained in less than $5$ seconds, while by using the CPLEX software to solve the mix-integer optimization model, the optimal solution cannot be obtained within $1$ hour.",

Our method combines operator splitting with a specialized $O(m\\log m)$ algorithm for projecting onto CVaR constraints, where $m$ is the number of scenarios. The method alternates between solving a linear system and performing parallel projections: onto CVaR constraints using our specialized algorithm and onto box constraints with a closed-form solution.

The problem of interest is formulated as the minimization of the total transmit power of the BSs, subject to all users' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints and all BSs' fronthaul rate constraints. In this paper, we first show that there is no duality gap between the considered joint optimization problem and its Lagrangian dual by showing the tightness of its semidefinite relaxation (SDR). Then, we propose an efficient algorithm based on the above duality result for solving the considered problem. The proposed algorithm judiciously exploits the special structure of an enhanced Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the considered problem and finds the solution that satisfies the enhanced KKT conditions via two fixed point iterations. Two key features of the proposed algorithm are: (1) it is able to detect whether the considered problem is feasible or not and find its globally optimal solution when it is feasible; (2) it is highly efficient because both of the fixed point iterations in the proposed algorithm are linearly convergent and evaluating the functions in the fixed point iterations are computationally cheap. Numerical results show the global optimality and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

This research addresses the operational challenges of bed and staffing capacity planning in hospital wards by using predictive and prescriptive analytical methods, both individually and in tandem. We applied these methodologies to a study of 165,000 patients across a network of 11 hospitals in the UK. Predictive modelling, specifically Classification and Regression Trees, forecasts patient length of stay based on clinical and demographic data. On the prescriptive side, deterministic and two-stage stochastic optimisation models determine optimal bed and staff planning strategies to minimise costs. Linking the predictive models with the prescriptive optimisation models, generates demand forecasts that inform the optimisation process, providing accurate and practical solutions. The results demonstrate that this integrated approach captures real-world variations in patient LOS and offers a 7% cost saving compared to average-based planning. This approach helps healthcare managers make robust decisions by incorporating patient-specific characteristics, improving capacity allocation, and mitigating risks associated with demand variability. Consequently, this combined methodology can be broadly extended across various sectors facing similar challenges, showcasing the versatility and effectiveness of integrating predictive and prescriptive analytics.",

We develop novel algorithms that achieve minimax-optimal excess risk (up to logarithmic factors) under the $\\epsilon$-contamination model. Our approach improves over existing algorithms, which are not only suboptimal but also require stringent assumptions, including Lipschitz continuity and smoothness of individual sample functions. By contrast, our optimal algorithms do not require these stringent assumptions, assuming only population-level smoothness of the loss. Moreover, our algorithms can be adapted to handle the case in which the covariance parameter is unknown, and can be extended to nonsmooth population risks via convolutional smoothing.

Our work is divided into three parts: a study of the structure of the free boundary problem on convex domains in $\\mathbf{R}^n$ showing that the product allocation map remains Lipschitz up to most of the fixed boundary and that each bunch extends to this boundary; a proof in $\\mathbf{R}^2$ that the interior free boundary can only fail to be smooth in one of four specific ways (cusp, high frequency oscillations, stray bunch, nontranversal bunch); and, finally, the first complete solution to Rochet and Choné's example on the family of squares $\\Omega = (a,a+1)^2$, where we discover bifurcations first to targeted and then to blunt bunching as the distance $a \\ge 0$ to the origin is increased. We use techniques from the study of the Monge--Ampére equation, the obstacle problem, and localization for measures in convex-order.",

    "summary": "Study of the KPZ universality class has seen the emergence of universal objects over the past decade which arrive as the scaling limit of the member models. One such object is the directed landscape, and it is known that exactly solvable last passage percolation (LPP) models converge to the directed landscape under the KPZ scaling. Large deviations of the directed landscape on the metric level were recently studied in arXiv:2405.14924, which also provides a general framework for establishing such large deviation principle (LDP). The main goal of the article is to employ and tweak that framework to establish a LDP for LPP models at the metric level without assuming exact solvability. We then use the LDP on the metric level to establish a LDP for geodesics in these models, providing a streamlined way to study large transversal fluctuations of geodesics in these models.",

Using sharp tools from the analysis on Wiener chaos, we establish the asymptotic normality of the fluctuations of this correlation coefficient around its long-time limit, which is the mathematical correlation coefficient between the two processes. This asymptotic normality is quantified in Kolmogorov distance, which allows us to establish speeds of convergence in the Type-II error for two simple tests of independence of the paths, based on the empirical correlation, and based on its numerator. An application to independence of two observations of solutions to the stochastic heat equation is given, with excellent asymptotic power properties using merely a small number of the solutions' Fourier modes.",

The starting point of our analysis is a formula for the correlation kernel due to Duits and Kuijlaars which involves the Christoffel-Darboux kernel of a particular family of non-Hermitian orthogonal polynomials. Our main results are split into two parts: the first part concerns the family of orthogonal polynomials, and the second concerns the behavior of the boundary of the so-called arctic curve. In the first half, we identify the orthogonal polynomials as a non-standard instance of little $q$-Jacobi polynomials and compute their large degree asymptotics in the $q \\to 1$ regime. A consequence of this analysis is a proof that the zeros of the orthogonal polynomials accumulate on an arc of a circle and an asymptotic formula for the Christoffel-Darboux kernel. In the second half, we use these asymptotics to show that the boundary of the liquid region converges to the Airy process, in the sense of finite dimensional distributions, away from the boundary of the hexagon. At inflection points of the arctic curve, we show that we do not need to subtract/add a parabola to the Airy line ensemble, and this effect persists at distances which are $o(N^{-2/9})$ in the tangent direction.",

We present a generalization of the sticky random walk for which Golowich and Vadhan predict a TVD upper bound of $O(\\lambda p^{O(p)})$ using a Fourier-analytic approach. For this family of graphs, we use a combinatorial approach involving the Krawtchouk functions to derive a strengthened TVD of $O(\\lambda)$.

    "summary": "We study the voter model on Z with long-range interactions, as proposed by Hammond and Sheffield. We show a spacetime rescaling converges to a fractional Gaussian free field, which can be viewed as a one-parameter family of fractional Brownian motions. As a consequence, we obtain that long-range voter models rescale to fractional Gaussian noise. The argument uses the Lindeberg swapping technique and heat kernel estimates for random walks with jump distributions in the domain of attraction of a stable law.",

    "summary": "In Catalan percolation, all nearest-neighbor edges $\\{i,i+1\\}$ along $\\mathbb Z$ are initially occupied, and all other edges are open independently with probability $p$. Open edges $\\{i,j\\}$ are occupied if some pair of edges $\\{i,k\\}$ and $\\{k,j\\}$, with $i<k<j$, become occupied. This model was introduced by Gravner and the third author, in the context of polluted graph bootstrap percolation.\nWe prove that the critical $p_{\\mathrm c}$ is strictly between that of oriented site percolation on $\\mathbb Z^2$ and the Catalan growth rate $1/4$. Our main result shows that an enhanced oriented percolation model, with non-decaying infinite-range dependency, has a strictly smaller critical parameter than the classical model. This is reminiscent of the work of Duminil-Copin, Hilário, Kozma and Sidoravicius on brochette percolation. Our proof differs, however, in that we do not use Aizenman--Grimmett enhancements or differential inequalities. Two key ingredients are the work of Hilário, Sá, Sanchis and Teixeira on stretched lattices, and the Russo--Seymour--Welsh result for oriented percolation by Duminil-Copin, Tassion and Teixeira.",

We obtain long- and short time asymptotic error bounds on the maximal distance from the solution of the stochastic reaction-diffusion equation to the orbit of travelling wave fronts. These bounds, in terms of Hurst index and Hölder exponent, apply to a large class of infinite-dimensional self-similar drivers with Hölder continuous paths, such as linear fractional stable motion. We find that for short times, higher Hurst indices imply higher stability, while for large times, the difference of Hurst index to Hölder exponent influences the size of scaling exponents of the noise amplitude that are sufficient to ensure stability.",

    "summary": "In the PDE approach to mean-field spin glasses, it has been observed that the free energy of convex spin glass models could be enriched by adding an extra parameter in its definition, and that the thermodynamic limit of the enriched free energy satisfies a partial differential equation. This parameter can be thought of as a matrix-valued path, and the usual free energy is recovered by setting this parameter to be the constant path taking only the value $0$. Furthermore, the enriched free energy can be expressed using a variational formula, which is a natural extension of the Parisi formula for the usual free energy. For models with scalar spins the Parisi formula can be expressed as an optimization problem over a convex set, and it was shown in [arXiv:1402.5132] that this problem has a unique optimizer thanks to a strict convexity property. For models with vector spins, the Parisi formula cannot easily be written as a convex optimization problem. In this paper, we generalize the uniqueness of Parisi measures proven in [arXiv:1402.5132] to the enriched free energy of models with vector spins when the extra parameter is a strictly increasing path. Our approach relies on a Gateaux differentiability property of the free energy and the envelope theorem.",

    "summary": "The study of almost surely discrete random probability measures is an active line of research in Bayesian nonparametrics. The idea of assuming interaction across the atoms of the random probability measure has recently spurred significant interest in the context of Bayesian mixture models. This allows the definition of priors that encourage well-separated and interpretable clusters. In this work, we provide a unified framework for the construction and the Bayesian analysis of random probability measures with interacting atoms, encompassing both repulsive and attractive behaviours. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the posterior distribution, the marginal and predictive distributions, which were not previously available except for the case of measures with i.i.d. atoms. We show how these quantities are fundamental both for prior elicitation and to develop new posterior simulation algorithms for hierarchical mixture models. Our results are obtained without any assumption on the finite point process that governs the atoms of the random measure. Their proofs rely on analytical tools borrowed from the Palm calculus theory, which might be of independent interest. We specialise our treatment to the classes of Poisson, Gibbs, and determinantal point processes, as well as in the case of shot-noise Cox processes. Finally, we illustrate the performance of different modelling strategies on simulated and real datasets.",

While significant efforts have focused on system-level engineering, little is explored from a mathematical modeling and queuing perspective.\nIn this paper, we aim to develop the queuing fundamentals for large language model (LLM) inference, bridging the gap between the queueing theory and LLM system communities. In particular, we study the throughput aspect in LLM inference systems. We prove that a large class of 'work-conserving' scheduling algorithms can achieve maximum throughput for individual inference LLM engine, highlighting 'work-conserving' as a key design principle in practice. In a network of LLM agents, work-conserving scheduling alone is insufficient, particularly when facing specific workload structures and multi-class workflows that require more sophisticated scheduling strategies. Evaluations of real-world systems show that Orca and Sarathi-serve are throughput-optimal, reassuring practitioners, while FasterTransformer and vanilla vLLM are not maximally stable and should be used with caution. Our results highlight the substantial benefits that the queueing community can offer in improving LLM inference systems and call for more interdisciplinary development.",

We provide several examples of higher dagger categories, such as those associated to state sum models, (orbifolds of) Landau--Ginzburg models, and truncated affine Rozansky--Witten models.

We expand on those results in this paper: we show that, for each $n\\geq 3$, there is a BCK-algebra of order $n$ realizing each possible commuting degree and that the minimum commuting degree is achieved by a unique BCK-algebra of order $n$ Additionally, we show that every rational number in $(0,1]$ is the commuting degree of some finite BCK-algebra.",

By exploiting the algebraic structure of complex quaternions, we introduce a new approach to generating minimal surfaces via quaternionic transformations. This method extends classical Weierstraß-Enneper representations and provides insights into the interplay between quaternionic analysis, PH curves, and minimal surface geometry. Additionally, we discuss the role of the Sylvester equation in this framework and demonstrate practical examples, including the construction of Enneper surface patches. The findings open new avenues in computational geometry and geometric modeling, bridging abstract algebraic structures with practical applications in CAD and computer graphics.",

Let $f(z_1,\\ldots,z_n)\\in\\mathbb{Z}[z_1,\\ldots,z_n]$ be a symmetric polynomial with integer coefficients and let $\\omega$ be a primitive $d$th root of unity. If $d|n$ or $d|(n-1)$ then we have $f(1,\\ldots,\\omega^{n-1})\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. If $d|n$ then of course we have $f(\\omega,\\ldots,\\omega^n)=f(1,\\ldots,\\omega^{n-1})\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, but when $d|(n+1)$ we also have $f(\\omega,\\ldots,\\omega^n)\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. We investigate these three families of integers in the case $f=h_k^{(b)}$, where $h_k^{(b)}$ is the coefficient of $t^k$ in the generating function $\\prod_{i=1}^n (1+z_it+\\cdots+(z_it)^{b-1})$. These polynomials were previously considered by several authors. They interpolate between the elementary symmetric polynomials ($b$=2) and the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials ($b\\to\\infty$). When $\\gcd(b,d)=1$ with $d|n$ or $d|(n-1)$ we find that the integers $h_k^{(b)}=(1,\\omega,\\ldots,\\omega^{n-1})$ are related to cyclic sieving of multisets with multiplicities bounded above by $b$, generalizing the well know cyclic sieving results for sets ($b=2$) and multisets ($b\\to \\infty$). When $\\gcd(b,d)=1$ and $d|(n+1)$ we find that the integers $h_k^{(b)}(\\omega,\\omega^2,\\ldots,\\omega^n)$ are related to the Frobenius coin problem with two coins.

Discretizing infinite-dimensional nonlinear spectral problems often introduces significant computational challenges, particularly spectral pollution and invisibility, which can distort or obscure the true underlying spectrum. We present the first general, convergent computational method for computing the spectra and pseudospectra of nonlinear spectral problems. Our approach uses new results on nonlinear injection moduli and requires only minimal continuity assumptions: specifically, continuity with respect to the gap metric on operator graphs, making it applicable to a broad class of problems. We use the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) hierarchy, which has recently been used to resolve the classical linear problem, to systematically classify the computational complexity of nonlinear spectral problems. Our results establish the optimality of the method and reveal that Hermiticity does not necessarily simplify the computational complexity of these nonlinear problems. Comprehensive examples -- including nonlinear shifts, Klein--Gordon equations, wave equations with acoustic boundary conditions, time-fractional beam equations, and biologically inspired delay differential equations -- demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and broad applicability of our methodology.",

    "summary": "We extend the pseudorandomness of random walks on expander graphs using the sticky random walk. Building on prior works, it was recently shown that expander random walks can fool all symmetric functions in total variation distance (TVD) upto an $O(\\lambda(\\frac{p}{\\min f})^{O(p)})$ error, where $\\lambda$ is the second largest eigenvalue of the expander, $p$ is the size of the arbitrary alphabet used to label the vertices, and $\\min f = \\min_{b\\in[p]} f_b$, where $f_b$ is the fraction of vertices labeled $b$ in the graph. Golowich and Vadhan conjecture that the dependency on the $(\\frac{p}{\\min f})^{O(p)}$ term is not tight. In this paper, we resolve the conjecture in the affirmative for a family of expanders. We present a generalization of the sticky random walk for which Golowich and Vadhan predict a TVD upper bound of $O(\\lambda p^{O(p)})$ using a Fourier-analytic approach. For this family of graphs, we use a combinatorial approach involving the Krawtchouk functions to derive a strengthened TVD of $O(\\lambda)$. Furthermore, we present equivalencies between the generalized sticky random walk, and, using linear-algebraic techniques, show that the generalized sticky random walk parameterizes an infinite family of expander graphs.",

    "summary": "We study the trapezoidal rule for periodic functions on uniform grids and show that the quadrature error exhibits a rich deterministic structure, beyond traditional asymptotic or statistical interpretations. Focusing on the prototype function f(x) = sin^2(2 pi k x), we derive an analytical expression for the error governed by a resonance function chi_P(y), closely related to the Dirichlet kernel, roots of unity, and discrete Fourier analysis on the group Z/PZ. This function acts as a spectral filter, connecting the integration error to arithmetic properties such as k/P and geometric phase cancellation, visualized as vector averaging on the unit circle. We introduce the Resonance Bias Framework (RBF), a generalization to arbitrary smooth periodic functions, leading to the error representation B_P[f] = sum_{k != 0} c_k chi_P(k/P). Although this is mathematically equivalent to the classical aliasing sum, it reveals a deeper mechanism: the quadrature error arises from structured resonance rather than random aliasing noise. The RBF thus provides an interpretable framework for understanding integration errors at finite resolution, grounded in number theory and geometry.",

We aim to prove a similar statement where the notion of close is whether the given (signed) subgraph count can be used as a test between $\\mathbb{G}(n,1/2)$ and a stochastic block model $\\mathbb{SBM}.$\nQuantitatively, this is related to approximately maximizing $H \\longrightarrow |\\Phi(H)|^{\\frac{1}{|\\mathsf{V}(H)|}},$ where $\\Phi(H)$ is the Fourier coefficient of $\\mathbb{SBM}$, indexed by subgraph $H.$ This formulation turns out to be equivalent to approximately maximizing the partition function of a spin model over alphabet equal to the community labels in $\\mathbb{SBM}.$\nWe resolve the approximate maximization when $\\mathbb{SBM}$ satisfies one of four conditions: 1) the probability of an edge between any two vertices in different communities is exactly $1/2$; 2) the probability of an edge between two vertices from any two communities is at least $1/2$ (this case is also covered in a recent work of Yu, Zadik, and Zhang); 3) the probability of belonging to any given community is at least $c$ for some universal constant $c>0$; 4) $\\mathbb{SBM}$ has two communities. In each of these cases, we show that there is an approximate maximizer of $|\\Phi(H)|^{\\frac{1}{|\\mathsf{V}(H)|}}$ in the set $\\mathsf{A} = \\{\\text{stars, 4-cycle}\\}.$ This implies that if there exists a constant-degree polynomial test distinguishing $\\mathbb{G}(n,1/2)$ and $\\mathbb{SBM},$ then the two distributions can also be distinguished via the signed count of some graph in $\\mathsf{A}.$ We conjecture that the same holds true for distinguishing $\\mathbb{G}(n,1/2)$ and any graphon if we also add triangles to $\\mathsf{A}.$",

One of the two authors has known Patrick Cattiaux for a very long time, and owes him a great deal. If we are to illustrate the adage that life is made up of chance, then what could be better than the meeting of two young people in the 80s, both of whom fell in love with the mathematics of randomness, and one of whom changed the other's life by letting him in on a secret: if you really believe in it, you can turn this passion into a profession. By another happy coincidence, this tribute comes at just the right time, as Michel Talagrand has been awarded the Abel prize. The temptation was therefore great to do a double. Following one of the many galleries opened up by mathematics, we shall first draw a link between the mathematics of Patrick Cattiaux and that of Michel Talagrand. Then we shall show how the abstract probabilistic material on the concentration of product measures thus revisited can be used to shed light on cut-off phenomena in our field of expertise, mathematical statistics. Nothing revolutionary here, as everyone knows the impact that Talagrand's work has had on the development of mathematical statistics since the late 90s, but we've chosen a very simple framework in which everything can be explained with minimal technicality, leaving the main ideas to the fore.",

    "summary": "The topic of multiple hypotheses testing now has a potpourri of novel theories and ubiquitous applications in diverse scientific fields. However, the universal utility of this field often hinders the possibility of having a generalized theory that accommodates every scenario. This tradeoff is better reflected through the lens of dependence, a central piece behind the theoretical and applied developments of multiple testing. Although omnipresent in many scientific avenues, the nature and extent of dependence vary substantially with the context and complexity of the particular scenario. Positive dependence is the norm in testing many treatments versus a single control or in spatial statistics. On the contrary, negative dependence arises naturally in tests based on split samples and in cyclical, ordered comparisons. In GWAS, the SNP markers are generally considered to be weakly dependent. Generalized familywise error rate (k-FWER) control has been one of the prominent frequentist approaches in simultaneous inference. However, the performances of k-FWER controlling procedures are yet unexplored under different dependencies. This paper revisits the classical testing problem of normal means in different correlated frameworks. We establish upper bounds on the generalized familywise error rates under each dependence, consequently giving rise to improved testing procedures. Towards this, we present improved probability inequalities, which are of independent theoretical interest",

These divergence families include the density power divergence and the $\\gamma$-divergence as special cases. First, we prove that the intersection of the Hölder divergence and the FDPD is limited to a general divergence family introduced by Jones et al. (Biometrika, 2001). Subsequently, motivated by the fact that Hölder's inequality is used in the proofs of nonnegativity for both the Hölder divergence and the FDPD, we define a generalized divergence family, referred to as the $\\xi$-Hölder divergence. The nonnegativity of the $\\xi$-Hölder divergence is established through a combination of the inequalities used to prove the nonnegativity of the Hölder divergence and the FDPD. Furthermore, we derive an inequality between the composite scoring rules corresponding to different FDPDs based on the $\\xi$-Hölder divergence. Finally, we prove that imposing the mathematical structure of the Hölder score on a composite scoring rule results in the $\\xi$-Hölder divergence.",

    "summary": "In many practical situations, randomly assigning treatments to subjects is uncommon due to feasibility constraints. For example, economic aid programs and merit-based scholarships are often restricted to those meeting specific income or exam score thresholds. In these scenarios, traditional approaches to estimating treatment effects typically focus solely on observations near the cutoff point, thereby excluding a significant portion of the sample and potentially leading to information loss. Moreover, these methods generally achieve a non-parametric convergence rate. While some approaches, e.g., Mukherjee et al. (2021), attempt to tackle these issues, they commonly assume that treatment effects are constant across individuals, an assumption that is often unrealistic in practice. In this study, we propose a differencing and matching-based estimator of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) in the presence of heterogeneous treatment effects, utilizing all available observations. We establish the asymptotic normality of our estimator and illustrate its effectiveness through various synthetic and real data analyses. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method yields non-parametric estimates of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) and individual treatment effect (ITE) as a byproduct.",

Leveraging this insight, we show that consistent recovery of the latent positions is achievable by appropriately adjusting the statistical inference procedure for the privatized graph. Furthermore, we prove that our procedure is nearly minimax-optimal under local edge differential privacy constraints.

The idea of assuming interaction across the atoms of the random probability measure has recently spurred significant interest in the context of Bayesian mixture models. This allows the definition of priors that encourage well-separated and interpretable clusters. In this work, we provide a unified framework for the construction and the Bayesian analysis of random probability measures with interacting atoms, encompassing both repulsive and attractive behaviours. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the posterior distribution, the marginal and predictive distributions, which were not previously available except for the case of measures with i.i.d. atoms. We show how these quantities are fundamental both for prior elicitation and to develop new posterior simulation algorithms for hierarchical mixture models. Our results are obtained without any assumption on the finite point process that governs the atoms of the random measure. Their proofs rely on analytical tools borrowed from the Palm calculus theory, which might be of independent interest. We specialise our treatment to the classes of Poisson, Gibbs, and determinantal point processes, as well as in the case of shot-noise Cox processes. Finally, we illustrate the performance of different modelling strategies on simulated and real datasets.",

The most popular analysis identifies active factors by inspecting the solution path of a penalized estimator, such as the lasso. Recent criteria encouraging positive correlations between factors have been shown to produce designs with more definitive solution paths so long as the active factors have positive effects. Two open problems affecting the understanding and practicality of supersaturated designs are: (1) do optimal designs under existing criteria maximize support recovery probability across an estimator's solution path, and (2) why do designs with positively correlated columns produce more definitive solution paths when the active factors have positive sign effects? To answer these questions, we develop criteria maximizing the lasso's sign recovery probability. We prove that an orthogonal design is an ideal structure when the signs of the active factors are unknown, and a design constant small, positive correlations is ideal when the signs are assumed known. A computationally-efficient design search algorithm is proposed that first filters through optimal designs under new heuristic criteria to select the one that maximizes the lasso sign recovery probability.",

    "summary": "We revisit the fundamental question of simple-versus-simple hypothesis testing with an eye towards computational complexity, as the statistically optimal likelihood ratio test is often computationally intractable in high-dimensional settings. In the classical spiked Wigner model with a general i.i.d. spike prior we show (conditional on a conjecture) that an existing test based on linear spectral statistics achieves the best possible tradeoff curve between type I and type II error rates among all computationally efficient tests, even though there are exponential-time tests that do better. This result is conditional on an appropriate complexity-theoretic conjecture, namely a natural strengthening of the well-established low-degree conjecture. Our result shows that the spectrum is a sufficient statistic for computationally bounded tests (but not for all tests).\nTo our knowledge, our approach gives the first tool for reasoning about the precise asymptotic testing error achievable with efficient computation. The main ingredients required for our hardness result are a sharp bound on the norm of the low-degree likelihood ratio along with (counterintuitively) a positive result on achievability of testing. This strategy appears to be new even in the setting of unbounded computation, in which case it gives an alternate way to analyze the fundamental statistical limits of testing.",

Suppose further that the priori probability of the true intensity is not given. We solve a minimax version of Bayesian problem of sequential testing of two simple hypotheses to minimize a linear combination of the probability of wrong detection and the expected waiting time in the worst scenario of all possible priori distributions.

This estimator integrates the recently advanced sliced Wasserstein distance with the nearest neighbor methods, both of which enhance computational efficiency.

    "summary": "LeCam's two-point testing method yields perhaps the simplest lower bound for estimating the mean of a distribution: roughly, if it is impossible to well-distinguish a distribution centered at $\\mu$ from the same distribution centered at $\\mu+\\Delta$, then it is impossible to estimate the mean by better than $\\Delta/2$. It is setting-dependent whether or not a nearly matching upper bound is attainable. We study the conditions under which the two-point testing lower bound can be attained for univariate mean estimation; both in the setting of location estimation (where the distribution is known up to translation) and adaptive location estimation (unknown distribution). Roughly, we will say an estimate nearly attains the two-point testing lower bound if it incurs error that is at most polylogarithmically larger than the Hellinger modulus of continuity for $\\tilde{\\Omega}(n)$ samples.\nAdaptive location estimation is particularly interesting as some distributions admit much better guarantees than sub-Gaussian rates (e.g. $\\operatorname{Unif}(\\mu-1,\\mu+1)$ permits error $\\Theta(\\frac{1}{n})$, while the sub-Gaussian rate is $\\Theta(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}})$), yet it is not obvious whether these rates may be adaptively attained by one unified approach. Our main result designs an algorithm that nearly attains the two-point testing rate for mixtures of symmetric, log-concave distributions with a common mean. Moreover, this algorithm runs in near-linear time and is parameter-free. In contrast, we show the two-point testing rate is not nearly attainable even for symmetric, unimodal distributions.\nWe complement this with results for location estimation, showing the two-point testing rate is nearly attainable for unimodal distributions, but unattainable for symmetric distributions.",

    "summary": "In the uniform deconvolution problem one is interested in estimating the distribution function $F_0$ of a nonnegative random variable, based on a sample with additive uniform noise. A peculiar and not well understood phenomenon of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator in this setting is the dichotomy between the situations where $F_0(1)=1$ and $F_0(1)<1$. If $F_0(1)=1$, the MLE can be computed in a straightforward way and its asymptotic pointwise behavior can be derived using the connection to the so-called current status problem. However, if $F_0(1)<1$, one needs an iterative procedure to compute it and the asymptotic pointwise behavior of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator is not known. In this paper we describe the problem, connect it to interval censoring problems and a more general model studied in Groeneboom (2024) to state two competing naturally occurring conjectures for the case $F_0(1)<1$. Asymptotic arguments related to smooth functional theory and extensive simulations lead us to to bet on one of these two conjectures.",

    "summary": "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) are powerful state-of-the-art methods used to generate synthetic data from high-dimensional data distributions and are widely used for image, audio, and video generation as well as many more applications in science and beyond. The \\textit{manifold hypothesis} states that high-dimensional data often lie on lower-dimensional manifolds within the ambient space, and is widely believed to hold in provided examples. While recent results have provided invaluable insight into how diffusion models adapt to the manifold hypothesis, they do not capture the great empirical success of these models, making this a very fruitful research direction.\nIn this work, we study DDPMs under the manifold hypothesis and prove that they achieve rates independent of the ambient dimension in terms of score learning. In terms of sampling complexity, we obtain rates independent of the ambient dimension w.r.t. the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and $O(\\sqrt{D})$ w.r.t. the Wasserstein distance. We do this by developing a new framework connecting diffusion models to the well-studied theory of extrema of Gaussian Processes.",

    "summary": "Score-matching generative models have proven successful at sampling from complex high-dimensional data distributions. In many applications, this distribution is believed to concentrate on a much lower $d$-dimensional manifold embedded into $D$-dimensional space; this is known as the manifold hypothesis. The current best-known convergence guarantees are either linear in $D$ or polynomial (superlinear) in $d$. The latter exploits a novel integration scheme for the backward SDE. We take the best of both worlds and show that the number of steps diffusion models require in order to converge in Kullback-Leibler~(KL) divergence is linear (up to logarithmic terms) in the intrinsic dimension $d$. Moreover, we show that this linear dependency is sharp.",
